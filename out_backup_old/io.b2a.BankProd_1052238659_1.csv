A few hours later I reached the UK Monzo who explained it was under review and they would let me know when they are done. Well ir suddenly hit me It's because I founded my account with my other banks debit card for $2k and my account less than a month ago. But they couldn't confirm if it's what caused my account being reviewed. So I sent them a picture of the debit card I used to pay with and my driver's license. Less than one hour later my account was unfroze. NOW I LOVE MONZO! and the fact I can add funds from my other debit cards (only mine) much easier to move funds quickly when I'm traveling to avoid the foreign transaction fees and Monzo works worldview no foreign transaction fees.

Fortunately I only had $47 in my account at the time but they took $45 of it and then continued to try to charge my account with 7-800 dollar purchases. I had to call the UK to get my problem resolved and that cost a FORTUNE on my cellphone plan. There really is no good side to this bank, I do NOT recommend.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-30T06:49:50-07:00

10020194874,coollady907,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id252772548,5.27.1,1,"Started off good, now missing funds","I really like the interface. I previously had simple and did think monzo was similar and a good replacement. I don‚Äôt like that the notifications don‚Äôt tell you your current balance, but ok.  
However, recently I placed an Amazon order for $300, that I then canceled. Amazon does what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúpending authorization‚Äù. Monzo is still holding onto the funds from that transaction, and this was 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôve contacted Amazon, and they confirmed the pending authorization was canceled and it‚Äôs up to the bank to make the funds available. Monzo says it‚Äôs up to Amazon; but I‚Äôve never had this problem before, typically I receive a refund within a day or two. 
I also had a grocery pick up order, where I had accidentally put the wrong billing address, and it showed as declined. However the funds were still removed from my account, even though it says ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù right next to the transaction. I had to order again, essentially paying twice. I really don‚Äôt like not having access to my funds, this isn‚Äôt a problem I‚Äôve ever had before. 2 weeks is too long to be holding onto money. I suppose that‚Äôs what you get for being in the US using a bank that originated in the UK. 
I never write reviews, but I‚Äôm so annoyed I just had to. I‚Äôll be switching banks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-10T13:00:42-07:00

Monzo is not just a banking app, it‚Äôs a budgeting app. It does so much more than an average banking app would do, and everything it does, it does truly great. There are certain features that any bank has, but Monzo doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs something that is a little disappointing, but I still prefer this over the other options. I appreciate that they are continuing to develop it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-12T06:19:37-07:00
