Three people were standing in hot sun looking for the ride that never came.  She said she was there and although I had told her where we were (in Uber waiting area) and what we were wearing, we never saw her.  She called and four minutes later, I called her and left message.  She cancelled trip, so  I had to start all over.  There is no way that she was in the right place.  Now, I‚Äôve been charged for a ride that we didn‚Äôt take.

The ride before and the subsequent ride were great, but this was a horrible experience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T12:58:20-07:00

He stated he had another job  and could not complete the ride.  Driver left us off at a random gas station for us to find another solution to his mistake.

We were late arriving at a destination. This is totally unacceptable. How can this situation be rectified ? Please credit my account.
