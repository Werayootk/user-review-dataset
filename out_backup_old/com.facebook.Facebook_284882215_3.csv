Spend a little time browsing in Marketplace and it WILL eventually crash, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much memory your device has.  Sometimes when you open a photo, it doesn‚Äôt give you any way to close out of it and the only way you can get back to doing anything is to quit and re-launch the Facebook app.  Anytime somebody sends me a Facebook URL in Messenger, clicking it just launches the FB app, but it doesn‚Äôt go to the page in the link.  It just shows whatever page I viewed last.  There are a lot more bugs, but those are the main ones I can think of at the moment!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T17:33:47-07:00
