First off they continuously scam you by having it auto select for XL Ubers. I’ve manually had to keep changing this and got screwed 3 times by it. Then they changed my fee and charged me $54 for a ride that was supposed to be $20 when I booked. Guess why? They changed it to XL. As a military member I’m on a very fixed income and this has stolen money from me so many times. I’ve tried contacting them but there’s has been no real person to speak with.
