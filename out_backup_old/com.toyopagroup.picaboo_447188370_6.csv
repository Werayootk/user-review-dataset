After shelling out $3.99 for Snapchat Premium, I was shocked to discover that it didn't include an ad-free experience as I had assumed. To add insult to injury, removing ads requires an additional $14 or so, making the true cost far beyond what was initially implied.

This blatant attempt to squeeze even more money out of users is beyond frustrating. It feels like a betrayal of trust and a slap in the face to loyal customers. Snapchat, you should be ashamed of yourselves for resorting to such underhanded tactics.

Moreover, the recent move to squeeze 4-second ads into 10-second snaps is beyond annoying. It's clear that Snapchat is trying to push users into subscribing, but they fail to realize that other apps like Instagram offer a better ""story experience"" without highly annoying ads that interrupt mid-10-second snaps.

I urge others to think twice before investing in Snapchat's premium features, as it's clear that their priority lies not in providing value to users, but in lining their pockets at any cost. Save your money and look elsewhere for a platform that respects its users and doesn't engage in such deceptive practices.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-16T08:36:34-07:00

I went to Snapchat one day and it was locked for “prohibited drug content”. What? I have never heard posted drug content! The only thing I can think of is when I shared my Instagram QR code on my story that had mushroom emojis on it. That is still ridiculous! 

I have been trying to appeal my account for five days now and Snapchat said they are usually aiding Snapchat users within 24-48 hours. I am tired of waiting on my account getting appealed and I am not allowed to make another account because my IP is banned. I don’t think I’ll ever use Snapchat every again due to this chaos. 

Screw you Snapchat.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-15T21:12:14-07:00
