Then, after calling AirBnB, they merely refer me back to Generali’s phone number. AirBnB’s insurance operation is fraudulent.

Por ejemplo, si cancelas tu reserva un día antes no te devuelven todo el dinero. Es entendible si hiciste la reserva semanas antes y le impediste al anfitrion tener la casa disponible para otros huespedes.
Pero a veces uno no tiene tiempo de andar planificando viajes con tanta anticipación, por ejemplo yo suelo buscar airbnb de un día para otro. Hace poco reservé un airbnb para el dia siguiente, instantaneamente me surgió una urgencia que me obligó a cambiar mis planes y en menos de 15 minutos cancelé la reserva. Como el sistema considera que estoy cancelando un dia antes del inicio de la estadia entonces elige no devolverme todo el dinero. Realmente tengo que perder 200usd por haber evitado que el anfitrión ofrezca esa vivienda durante 15 minutos?? A mi me parece injusto. Entiendo si me cobra una pequeña multa o un pequeño porcentaje. Pero básicamente le regalé 200usd a un anfitrion en 15 minutos. Acto seguido me prometi nunca mas volver a usar esta app.

El otro problema es que no sirve para planificar tu viaje porque nunca te muestra el precio final. Al principio parece que rinde economicamente pero luego agrega su comision y el servicio de limpieza y termina siendo mas caro que un hotel 3 estrellas, por lo que el 95% de las veces no conviene.

Recuerdo hace muchos años la app rendía porque era beneficiosa para anfitriones y huespedes. Mientras uno ganaba algo de dinero alquilando temporalmente su casa, el otro podia viajar un poco mas barato. Hoy los precios se han disparado a un nivel que ya no tiene sentido, afectando no solo al viajero sino tambien al vecino que vive en la ciudad y le aumenta constantemente el valor de alquileres de largo plazo al mismo tiempo que se reduce notablemente la oferta.

Their policies are very anti-user and regardless of how much of a heads up you give them or the hosts (probably from California) you’ll get pretty much next to nothing back. 

Customer supported offered me less than a third back. I told them to stick it, I’ll take the loss and never recommend their services ever again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-06T18:43:23-07:00
10663582934,silver175888,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id167785849,23.47,1,Horrible customer service,I am appalled at the support I have received from this app! I got an Airbnb and unfortunately not a good one! I called for support and of course its some support in another country. You cant get an American customer support rep and they dont care about you having a serious concern. I have requested a supervisor and I have been told they cant transfer me to a supervisor or a manager. I will never understand why an American made service will alway outsource instead of giving ppl here in America opportunities to work. All for the sense of saving a dollar! At this point I rather pay extra at a hotel. At least if i have problem it gets fixed immediately!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-06T06:44:54-07:00

My review of the host was negative because it was a terrible experience. I was confused why her place was rated so high, and now I get why: they are removing negative reviews so they don’t lose business. I will never book with them again because now I can’t even trust the ratings, since they are being tampered with.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T16:04:06-07:00

I am disgusted that a company I started to like and use more often chooses to be complicit in illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Palestinians get kicked out of their home and have their homes stolen and then listed on Airbnb. And they choose to continue listing these properties even after announcing they’ll remove them from the platform.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T00:29:46-07:00
