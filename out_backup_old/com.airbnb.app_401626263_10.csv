Por ejemplo, si cancelas tu reserva un d√≠a antes no te devuelven todo el dinero. Es entendible si hiciste la reserva semanas antes y le impediste al anfitrion tener la casa disponible para otros huespedes.
Pero a veces uno no tiene tiempo de andar planificando viajes con tanta anticipaci√≥n, por ejemplo yo suelo buscar airbnb de un d√≠a para otro. Hace poco reserv√© un airbnb para el dia siguiente, instantaneamente me surgi√≥ una urgencia que me oblig√≥ a cambiar mis planes y en menos de 15 minutos cancel√© la reserva. Como el sistema considera que estoy cancelando un dia antes del inicio de la estadia entonces elige no devolverme todo el dinero. Realmente tengo que perder 200usd por haber evitado que el anfitri√≥n ofrezca esa vivienda durante 15 minutos?? A mi me parece injusto. Entiendo si me cobra una peque√±a multa o un peque√±o porcentaje. Pero b√°sicamente le regal√© 200usd a un anfitrion en 15 minutos. Acto seguido me prometi nunca mas volver a usar esta app.

El otro problema es que no sirve para planificar tu viaje porque nunca te muestra el precio final. Al principio parece que rinde economicamente pero luego agrega su comision y el servicio de limpieza y termina siendo mas caro que un hotel 3 estrellas, por lo que el 95% de las veces no conviene.

Recuerdo hace muchos a√±os la app rend√≠a porque era beneficiosa para anfitriones y huespedes. Mientras uno ganaba algo de dinero alquilando temporalmente su casa, el otro podia viajar un poco mas barato. Hoy los precios se han disparado a un nivel que ya no tiene sentido, afectando no solo al viajero sino tambien al vecino que vive en la ciudad y le aumenta constantemente el valor de alquileres de largo plazo al mismo tiempo que se reduce notablemente la oferta.

And the time they allow you to review a host isn‚Äôt enough time to resolve a dispute, so don‚Äôt let the good host reviews fool you. What a joke.

I got an Airbnb and unfortunately not a good one! I called for support and of course its some support in another country. You cant get an American customer support rep and they dont care about you having a serious concern. I have requested a supervisor and I have been told they cant transfer me to a supervisor or a manager. I will never understand why an American made service will alway outsource instead of giving ppl here in America opportunities to work. All for the sense of saving a dollar!
