LinkedIn never found me a job even though I applied for several. LinkedIn does not give much help when it comes to resume building, networking, or help actually landing the job you qualify for. LinkedIn learning certifications are absolutely useless, I found better educational videos on topics using YouTube. The truth is LinkedIn has a reality distortion field, it makes you think you need it but you don’t. There are way too many spam accounts and I really wish people would stop messaging me, unasked by the way, to fix my resume. I really hate this site and it needs to die. Worst job website ever. If you pay for LinkedIn learning you are a sucker.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T22:28:42-07:00
10800504028,gorchimundo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1266078030,9.1.347,4,Good overall but I do wish there were more filtering options,"I’ve gotten a few jobs from indeed over the years, it’s a good site and generally you don’t come across an overwhelming number of fake or outdated job listings like you do other places.

The only improvement I’d wish to see is improved filters for wages. If there were an option to filter out jobs that don’t post the salary themselves or an option to filter out jobs that post salary ranges that would be great.

If you set your filter to something like $40,000 a year let’s say, many jobs will have a pay range listed with the high end within your desired salary, but a low end that’s far lower.

It is also frustrating to look for “Entry level” or “No experience required” jobs and need to scroll through dozens of jobs that require bachelors or masters degrees in specific fields. I understand those can still be entry level, but it would be really convenient to filter out jobs that require specific degrees. Often times the existing options aren’t capable of this.

10739170997,jdk5115,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1242596593,9.1.346,1,Unwanted notifications and lame comment section ruin it,"Definitely expect better from a company this big. Everyday I get new “notifications” about stuff I’ve previously turned off. It seems they find a new way to sign me up for things I’ve never asked for. 

For example: 
So-and-so is live. 

Or 2 of your connections interacted with a post. 

I constantly turn these off but I seem to have a new one everyday. The live notifications might be by person (which is crazy to think about turning them all off). If that’s not the case they’re simply changing the wording on the notifications slightly (which is deceptive).

Also the comments section is trash. If there is a comment they don’t want others to see they will hide it under the banner of “relevancy”. It stifles conversation and turns every comment section into an echo chamber of self-righteous drivel. 

If you want to break your addiction, unfollow all your groups and change your timeline to chronological. Since I’ve done that I’ve stopped using it completely and eventually deleted it. I only download it to respond to DMs when not at my computer.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-24T05:33:08-07:00

I’ve only received one interview via LinkedIn (back in 2021) despite my consistent efforts. There needs to be a better vetting process of companies looking for employees because clearly there are a lot of false advertisements of opportunities.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-23T18:29:16-07:00
