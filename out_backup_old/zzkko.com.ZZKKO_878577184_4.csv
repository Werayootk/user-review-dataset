It has so many great clothing picks, and amazing fashion! The jewelry is top notch and there is so much of it!  This is probably my favorite place to find clothes! Other than Old Navy‚Ä¶. It has so many choices along with cheap affordable prices! My mom got me so many cute sweaters and sweatshirts off it for Christmas. I love that the shirts have cute sayings like ‚Äú Back off! I have a big sister and I am not afraid to use her!‚Äù Or ‚Äú Be Kind!‚Äù The earrings are adorable and there are some for all girl ages. The dresses are a great length. They‚Äôre not to short, if you are worried about that‚Ä¶. You can find almost anything that has a cute logo on it! I haven‚Äôt looked at the shoes yet, but I bet they are great! The only thing is that there are crop tops in almost every set of clothes! Even in the 6-7 year old catagory! What is up with that! Even the dresses! I still think the app is great, but think that they need to change that one little problem.

I did pay for the order. After 3 weeks I emailed and they said it was shipped and at my local post office . Never got it . Went to 3 of our post offices and they all got on their computers to try to track it but instead , they all found out the order has not left China . I received about 5 emails and they all were the same automated answer . The same 5 auto emails said‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù. ‚ÄúYour order has been shipped. Track your package . Contact your local post office‚Äù. Wel I tried all that 5 times. And no refund ‚Ä¶ I have been scammed . Since I placed my order., my card has gotten fraud charges on it . Just started since I place my order . This company is a scam and they keep your money and use your charge card .
