There's no use submitting dozens of complaints, it's simple: Uber clearly does not have its drivers submit images of their cars to prove cleanliness like a rental car app would, it's not hard. With all the surveillance, they could do that. Uber could encourage drivers to roll down the windows between rides or otherwise air out their breath and body odor before a new person gets in. Simple things that are not being done, and we're all paying way too much for these 1980s standards. I've literally gotten sick from sick drivers working while sick and sneezing while unmasked. I don't care if it's ""just a cold"" that is unprofessional. So disgusting.
