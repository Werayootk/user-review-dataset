11002769654,f*ck a nickname apple,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1410208653,10.8.2,2,Fantastic Concept Awash in Bugs,"Like literally swimming in them. You can make groups, but it‚Äôs going to add and remove any channel it feels like at random (sometimes a group will break and every channel ever will be added to it up to the max, including every new one you follow‚Äîtake them out, it‚Äôll put them back). 

You can pay for premium, but sometimes it‚Äôll glitch out and pretend you didn‚Äôt (limiting your pins to the regular arbitrary number until you restart). I‚Äôve had it happen with the number of channels you can follow too.

You even try to do something as simple as re-order your pins, and the editor only works for two moves (at which point it starts only moving it one space per grab & then dropping it or it just refreshes you to the top of the screen with nothing moved).

If this simple stuff were fixed, it‚Äôd be 5 stars from me. I don‚Äôt like them caving to Big Tech censorship, but I do like that they‚Äôve preserved the integrity of the web version at least. It‚Äôs so frustrating dealing with these obnoxious bugs though. And there‚Äôs no such thing as support. It‚Äôs completely non-responsive (they‚Äôre as likely to look at your message as X is to read your appeal), which is a little crazy when you‚Äôre paying for something.

I sincerely hope this app can be cleaned up because it really does crush the competition in many ways. Overall, I‚Äôll keep using it, but I have to wonder if I should keep paying for premium under these conditions.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-02T23:43:13-07:00
