10988145037,jonessoda17,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id557652198,320.0,2,WHERE ARE THE DMS???,I don‚Äôt understand why the basic functionality of sharing things with your friends within the app isn‚Äôt a main priority for Threads. The connection to Instagram seems really short sighted in the long run as I feel Threads and Instagram cater to completely different audiences which hinders Threads from having its own individual identity. I get excited for every update hoping that they add this simple feature but they never do it. Threads is exactly like Twitter but with less features. It‚Äôs hard to justify spending any time at all on the app when you know you are investing in a lesser experience. I would give it a higher rating but it‚Äôs been months and the updates have been very lackluster. To say I am disappointed is an understatement.
