Some about premium, some not. See, I get it that the ads need premium to be removed, but downloading I don’t understand. Second, it plays something else after I finish that like a finished the whole 11 hour playlist! Also does the instant replay also exist on premium or normal Spotify, because I love replaying stuff (especially when it doesn’t have at least 1 hour in it).
