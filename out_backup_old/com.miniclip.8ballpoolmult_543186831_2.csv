I actually play pool in real life and can 100% say the balls don‚Äôt react the same everytime in the game. If I have a straight line going directly to a ball and directly to a hole, hit from the bottom of the ball (the cue ball is suppose to reverse direction). The cue ball will continue forward and even go in an side direction. Furthermore, I‚Äôve never seen anyone with more than a 60% win rate, I was at 59 before I deleted the game. And that was the highest I‚Äôve seen, over 450 matches. Every time I star rate this game, my review gets removed. I even tried to play easy matches to raise the win rate and instead they kept giving me people over level 120 (I was level 30).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T10:23:41-07:00
