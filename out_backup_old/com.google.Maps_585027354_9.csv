Same thing with font. How do I zoom in to read names but not have the font stay the same size? -- I hate the advertising all over my map. I don't shop at the Wade-in-McHina store, nor do I eat at McIcky's so I have no need to know where they are. I spent (wasted?) time awhile ago trying to eliminate useless categories without success but would love to see that change. 

I kinda feel sorry for people who do stupid things when using Google *Maps* … or do I? Here’s how to help protect yourself from time wasting mistakes (like e.g. driving into an apartment complex while trying to go to a restaurant) and help yourself long term. Get your route and stop there. No directions, at least no audio. Now you'll talk yourself through the route to your destination. If you're uncertain about cardinal directions use left, right, u-turn, etc. I often use both. Narrate the route to yourself *out loud* ※:  
❝*Pull out on 38th St, turn right (south) Get in the left lane when it's convenient *Drive 7 blocks(1mi) to Navajo Ave, turn left (east) Continue east for 2 miles past the edge of town, past Foxvale. The compost pickup is on your right (south) *If you get to 2 schools you've gone too far.❞  
Don't panic if you make a mistake- just pull over and reorient yourself. You won't have that awful voice nor do your passengers *and* you’ll gain map knowledge rather than barely functional route knowledge so you’ll actually know where you are. Putting yourself in the middle of the map won’t help you understand what direction you’re facing. 

Some of the ""I hate what happened with the update"" complaints aren't hard to prevent: turn off automatic updates. (Reset it in Settings.) I don't bother with updates for watch, for example, because I don't have one and it may have introduced a bug. New versions of iOS have to prove themselves after I was burned awhile back.

※ Speaking the directions engages motor and audio processing so it should help with your understanding and recall.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-29T16:18:38-07:00

I was driving at night and there was no traffic . Google maps was giving me options to leave the interstate and go on a freakin triangle for absolutely no reason . I understand if it was traffic or road construction .

Update :02/29/2024 I went from 5 stars to 3 to 1. Google is getting dumber by the day . 
Another annoying thing is it sends me notifications to rate this restaurant that I already rated 2 years ago . I rated it 5 stars and I even posted pictures . I moved to Colorado since then. Two years later for some weird reason keeps popping on my screen to rate it AGAIN . Here in Colorado when I choose directions to go to the airport and I avoid tolls , it changes automatically without even letting you know and sends you to the toll route . It’s almost seems like Google is getting paid by the toll authority to do that .

The bug has been around for so long that I’ve long since moved to other platforms. I hate Google products. Don’t start using maps because its so unreliable,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-27T18:27:19-07:00

If you stayed at HR Cabo you’ll be disappointed in the rooms at HR PV. Also, the constant borage of sales is the opposite of relaxing.
