I’ll center this one around the fact that the game has gotten significantly more boring and frustrating over time. The challenges aren’t as fun. The Pool Pass takes double the amount of time to complete and the rewards from the pool pass have become less enticing. Before you could win a couple Lucky Shots with some hefty rewards like 60 pool cash. Now, you have the chance of winning one. Given the shot is rigged and somehow your cue power does not function the same on these, it was nice to have the extra to adjust and MAYBE win something. They took that away. The app in general feels a bit more glitchy as well and not as smooth to operate. Ultimately Miniclip continues to become more and more money hungry catering more toward players with billions of coins and those willing to pay real money to play. Not fun for the average player anymore.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T23:02:06-07:00
