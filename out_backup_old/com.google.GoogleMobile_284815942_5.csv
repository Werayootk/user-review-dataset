So I asked some non-offensive questions, I was right. I asked the same question “list achievements of European Americans” and “list achievements of African Americans” It refused to list anything about white people. I strongly believe baking in politics into AI is incredibly concerning and wrong. AI should be FACTUAL and FREE of bias, as it’s not a human. So why would Google intentionally put human issues into Gemini? Isn’t the point of AI to help humanity solve issues that normally would clouded by a bias human mind? 
It also depicts Europeans and ancient Greeks with dark skin? So in the early stages of an AI, Google is teaching it that white people don’t exist? 
I know we are in a different time socially. But it’s simply unethical to modify results and teach AI to discriminate and/or be prejudice.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-27T10:44:40-07:00
