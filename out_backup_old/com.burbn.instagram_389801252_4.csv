In addition, it would be convenient to have multiple ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù list filters for different people who follow you, like family only is a purple circle, college friends only a red circle, maybe even a female/male followers only setting that allows you to share stories, posts, take polls, etc with only specified followers?
