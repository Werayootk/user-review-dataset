10989762513,PeerlessBryce,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41193777,4.2406.1,1,Too basic,"Missing many basic features: - can’t subscribe to internet calendars (kids sports games) - doesn’t intelligently offer folders to file messages like Apple does. This is important when you have hundreds of folders 

Deleting a message in a thread is mind numbing.  Most time I accidentally delete the whole thread of emails. This is a major miss - no swipe to delete individual email in a thread. You have to click the 3 little dots and hope you delete the right message in a thread. 

Not possible to move a message in a thread to a folder. How did they miss this?

Contact management is impossible. I have so many duplicates in my phone and all of them have this dumb outlook link to a webpage. They’ve ruined thousands of contacts 

Notifications don’t work. I will often get 3 popups of the same email. New email notification count on the app icon is always wrong. I’ve never once opened the app to have it match the number of new emails to the number notification on the app icon 

Can’t collapse folders when filing a message. Have to scroll through hundreds of folders to file messages away 

If my company did not force me to use this, it would not take up useless space in my phone. I have tried for 4 years to make this app work but it stinks. Fix the basics!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-28T11:27:03-07:00
