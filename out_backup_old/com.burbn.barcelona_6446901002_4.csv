It very quickly proved to be as ugly and unmoderated as Twitter. I've seen gay bashing, blatant racism, and all manner of other ugly, disrespectful posts in Threads that, in a couple of cases, went viral enough to start showing up in my regular Instagram feed every time I opened it, going so far as to start suggesting I follow these people. Instagram, in general, was a much more fun and welcoming platform before it was bought out by Facebook. Threads is just a layer of hot, steaming Meta garbage, in a sad, desperate attempt to be the next Twitter, on a platform that never needed it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T06:52:16-07:00

Personally I have received death threats online that dont get taken down, but I get ban threats from meta for calling someone dumb. 

They instigate arguments for retention.

 They allow massive amounts of bots to instigate, spam, scam, and pump up numbers to seem bigger than they are and misrepresent positions.
