MAKE THEM SHOW UP SOONER IN THE ZOOM. better yet, make them *always* show up, the same way other nations/countries are always labeled when you zoom out far enough. I am not native, but I demand accurate showing of who's land is who's. Also it's quite useful information at times, such as what laws you are under for driving permits, what level of respect to have for certain things, if the land you are on is public or not, etc. Thank you!!!!
