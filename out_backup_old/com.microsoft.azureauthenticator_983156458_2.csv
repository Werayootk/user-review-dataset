Today I have been trying for 20 minutes and it takes so long for the app to respond it times out.

Except now I need to re login to my verification app. Okay no problem, until I got a screen saying I need to open an Authenticator app and type in the numbers there…when I’m already in the app. Now not only can’t I get into my work account but I can’t even put that work account into the Authenticator.
