10314377645,Hattiehathat,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id283081524,23.33.1,2,Huge shipping price increase,"i‚Äôve been using Vinted for a few years now. It was my favorite thrifting app at first! They used to have $1 shipping on nearly everything, and $3 for heavier items. They raised shipping prices early this year, but it was still reasonable, like $3-$6 for any given item. But randomly a couple months ago, and without any notice, they‚Äôve doubled all the shipping prices! Even if someone is listing something for $1 you‚Äôll end up paying $20 because of their ridiculous snipping costs and fees. 
It was NOT like this when I first started using this app. I was buying things quite frequently, but now I rarely buy at all because it‚Äôs so expensive. I would switch to Depop or some other app instead, where at least the user can decide the pricing for shipping and it‚Äôs typically much cheaper. 
It‚Äôs a shame because I love everything about Vinted other than this. I hope they change their model in the future.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-29T22:03:56-07:00

It seemed easy at first. But after listing about 5 items, I sold 1 item, a t-shirt. I had a buyer. There was a link to print a shipping label. But when I pressed the link to get the shipping label, the app required my SSN and birthdate. This was after setting up payment method directly to my bank account. Now they want me to setup a Vinted Wallet supported by a third-party PSP (payment service provider). They use Ayden,N.V., a Dutch financial services company. Vinted is a Lithuanian company headquartered in Vilnius. It has very poor customer service. I placed a help ticket/email into their system. I got an automated message saying I will hear back in 48hrs. I don't trust this company. They have my name, address, bank account and want my SSN and birthdate without explanation or prior notification. Warning alarms went off. Firstly, they are deceptive in their practices. Secondly, they ask for too much information.
Thirdly, they wait to sale-jack your transaction until you and the buyer are waiting to ship the item. They must prepare sellers, provide trusted speedy customer service, have a trusted escrow-like company or in-house financing and make direct deposits to banks in a timely manner. There is no phone support. If you don‚Äôt mind risking your money, poor customer service response, no real seller or buyer protection, and possible counterfeit products, this might be the site for you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-18T02:31:54-07:00

‚Äî-> However, within the last year or so Vinted has really gone down hill. Shipping prices + other fees charged to the buyer end up being so high for the buyer that a lot of sellers have had to lower their prices way to low in order to make a sale. Also, even if a sellers price is low, the buyer still ends up paying quite a bit at the final checkout .. I don‚Äôt think many buyers will want to buy a secondhand item for what they end up paying after the fees and shipping are added. For example, for a simple shirt, you could end up paying close to 15.00 total. It just doesn‚Äôt really make sense anymore. So as a seller, it‚Äôs not really worth it when you factor in the time it takes to post something, and then the time/materials to ship it out. And as a buyer, you might as well just buy a new item for the price that you pay.
