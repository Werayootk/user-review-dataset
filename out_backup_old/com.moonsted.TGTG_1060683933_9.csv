10515877110,Jeffrito21,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27663191,23.10.10,1,Dumpster diving but more expensive,"I picked up a bag of produce from Manalo market in San Diego and everything was rotten. The avocado, the pear, the citrus, the lettuce, even the pineapple when you cut it open was moldy soft, rotten. Maybe if you stick with donuts and cookies from other venders  it‚Äôs OK? If this review allowed you to send pictures I could post images. I got a hot meal as well. Basically it was a day old chicken which theoretically could be cut up and used in chicken salad so I can‚Äôt complain about that and then I got a really disgusting small tub of some kind of pork rinds and maybe that‚Äôs an acquired taste so I‚Äôm just putting it out there that it wasn‚Äôt edible. At least for me. I could go to McDonald‚Äôs for $6 and get a better deal and that‚Äôs not saying much ):",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-25T19:57:35-07:00
