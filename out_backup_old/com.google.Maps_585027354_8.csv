As a regular user, I am continually amazed by its capabilities, particularly in helping me plan my daily commute to work.

The feature that stands out to me the most is the ability to accurately plan my route and determine the optimal time to leave home based on real-time traffic forecasts. This has been immensely helpful in ensuring that I arrive at work on time, even during peak traffic hours.

The combination of accurate travel time estimates and traffic predictions for the specific day has revolutionized my commuting experience. It not only saves me valuable time but also reduces the stress associated with uncertain travel conditions.

I truly believe that Google Maps is an indispensable tool for anyone navigating the modern world, and I am grateful for the dedication and innovation of your team in continuously improving and refining this platform.

Thank you for providing such an exceptional service that enhances the lives of millions of users worldwide.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-03T18:22:49-07:00

A panic every EVERY order I pick up and deliver. Why? As a door dasher I pay my mortgage and my food with my JOB delivering food. We can GET FIRED AUTOMATICALLY if we are late or do UNNECESSARY MILES during a dash because I get paid hourly because I choose to work 55 hours a week. So. Google maps will give me directions to my customers house but take me into neighborhoods and literally drive around a couple of blocks to then exit the neighborhood and drive a few miles to my actual customers home!!!!! What is happening!!!!!!
Another one is it takes me in the opposite direction down the highway for five minutes THEN SAYS MAKE A U TURN! I then just wasted a huge amount of time going in opposite directions! Since dasher app used google maps in app I am so busy I just follow the step by step procedures outlined by the dasher app when delivering for a customer so for example we do not get entire info at once. We get the step one direction to restaurant. Once there we press arrived we can see what is ordered. Once the order is handed to us we press confirm and we THEN get the customers address directions etc. so it’s not like we can plan ahead without opening Apple Maps or Waze and taking the TIME to copy the address into these other map apps and double checking which app is correct. ALSO IT WILL TAKE ME TO THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE 5 times out of 10. 
Also in a big apartment complex it will always take me TO THE FRONT OFFICE AND NOT THE AREA OF THE BUILDING (god google even a ballpark area of the apartment building address would save me looking CRAZY AS A 46 year old women RUNNING FULL BLAST WITH A DOOR DASH BAG AROUND EVERY BUILDING IN A COMPLEX ZIG ZAGGING TRYING TO FIND BUILDING Y AND IM AT BUILDING M!!!!!! 
now. We have the option to select Apple Maps and Waze as our maps in the dasher app BUT if we do DoorDash warns us NOT TO AND now it will put our door dasher app in the background and have to open up our maps out of app in a whole new window. :-(. 
So. Google. My kids and my cats will starve if I get fired. Please fix this. I JUST WANT TO DELIVER CUSTOMERS FOOD EARLY OR ON TIME AND DO A GOOD JOB AT MY WORK.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-02T10:22:41-07:00

Where’s the filter for highly rated locations, filter for price point, or even a filter for black owned business. a filter for how long the business has been on google. I would expect there to be more than a distance and relevance filter at this point.

Also, wouldnt it be cool to be able to see how far a location is from you while you are already in route to another one. Having to exit active nativigation in order to search a different location is a waste of time. Especially when I conclude the first location I was en route to is better. I know you can search along route but it’s as a stop add on, I’m mean a separate navigation/search just to weight options. See reviews, phones numbers etc. just as you would on a web browser. That would be awesome/

An lastly that navigation arrow is bothersome. I go the direction it says after giving it a moment to calibrate and it tells me I’m going the wrong way lol so annoying.
