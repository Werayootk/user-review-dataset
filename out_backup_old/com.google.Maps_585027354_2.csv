Twice it had me turn off the road I was on to take another road and then had me turn around and go back to the road I was on.

I mean seriously to figure that someone using an app like this is only going within a bladder’s length of time - you’re smoking crack. It is quite annoying to have (as the person from TorontoOH coined it) “Miss Yip-Yap” in the middle of emptying the bladder shout out where you should be going and multiple times, is enough to switch to a different app. 
   The second button that needs to be placed on this app is a “REROUTE” button or a “take me a different way” option.  Too many people willing to cause too many crashes added to the ever increasing traffic jams mix in some construction and you’ve got a severe need to find a different path.  Right now if I take that open lane to the off ramp Miss Yip-Yap is more than happy to guide me right back into the thick of the traffic jam.  Yes I know I can switch off the highway option but when the detour is on a side road turning off the highway option is not going to help since I was never on the highway.  I simply need a different route or better yet just get me around this jam. Parades and street parties happen far too often.
