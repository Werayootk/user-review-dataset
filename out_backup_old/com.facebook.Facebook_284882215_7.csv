1. Notifications just disappear!! ??? One minute  you see them and right before your very eyes they just disappear before you can click on them. What the heck for? This happens sporadically but at least every other day!
2. When you join a group, you can click on your profile photo while in that group and see everything that you posted since day one in that group. Now, for the past 3-4 months, all my postings have been duplicated and triplicated, so when I want to look back and see, for instance, how I described a certain doll in a prior posting, I have to scroll thru multiple images of the same postings just to get to the one I’m looking for. This can take up a lot of unnecessary scrolling! Totally ridiculous!
3.
