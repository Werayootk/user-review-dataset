The diversity of listings is always enjoyable and it’s always fun to see how the place looks in real life. Recently I booked an Airbnb for a trip to Mexico City. However, when I arrived the surrounding streets were filled with homeless drug addicts. As me and my girlfriend checked in were harassed our entire time trying to get into the apartment. We live in a big city so we are pretty used to getting harassed by homeless people, but this was pretty different. They kept grabbing our arms and not letting us get into our Airbnb. Neither me or my girlfriend felt safe spending the night there. So we booked a different hotel the same day and left. When I told Airbnb about my safety concerns they were not supportive at all. They said it was not their problem and they would only return less than 15% of cost despite me never spending a single night there. I would be expect this company to hold the safety of their customers in higher regard. But apparently they don’t care.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-06T11:35:09-07:00

What am I paying a $150-300 cleaning fee for when majority of hosts are giving me a list of chores to complete??? Asking me to pile the towels in one spot is one thing, but giving me multiple steps before I check out is an issue. “Throw a load of any used towels into the washer, take out trash and recycling, strip beds and pile sheets into washing room, load dirty dishes into dish washer, etc. etc.” I paid an extra $250 to CLEAN??? It should be one or the other. You know what I need to do at a hotel before check-out? *check out*. “$40/night turns into $240 really quick. I might as well stay that night in a luxury hotel.

10759681662,Johnny Radford,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id416363739,23.50,1,Misleading/deceptive pricing,"Airbnb advertises prices that end up nearly quadrupling when you check out. First, the price doubles when you select a date (sometimes triples if you select a weekend date); then that price doubles again after cleaning fees, service fees, and taxes.

How hard is it to just show a realistic nightly price inclusive of fees and taxes? The cleaning fees, service fees, and taxes are part of an existing algorithm, so at the very least, the minimum fees should be included in pricing.

My latest of many examples is a place advertised at $137/night. At checkout it increased to $494/night.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-29T10:10:01-07:00

10755250152,Trrev82,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1568523726,23.50,1,Use other options like Vacasa or Vrbo,"The company does everything to protect the hosts but nothing to protect the paying customers. There’s zero oversight for the hosts, they can post deceptive pictures of their place that shows a completely different place or only the “clean or fixed” parts. This has happened to us 2 out of the last 3 rentals.

The most recent one was the last straw. We booked a long term stay and paid $1800 upfront. The apartment looked decent for its affordability but when we went there it was not clean dirt everywhere, the carpets were disgusting, the paint was peeling, shower was broke, etc. It was not a clean and safe place for our twin toddlers. On the 2nd day we asked the host if we can cancel and get the money back if we paid for 5 nights, he said ok. We got another place on Vrbo expecting we would get refunded. 

We did not, even after a long battle with Airbnb and the host, Airbnb has never refunded our money. This is money that could have been used for our girls’ college fund or other things for our family. Airbnb and the host basically stole our money. Don’t ever use this app, we started using other alternatives and have had much better success. Until they provide more accountability toward the hosts…STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-28T08:03:14-07:00
