App Integration: Enables connection with other apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, etc., for easy scheduling and joining of meetings.

Polls and Surveys: Facilitates the creation and launching of polls and surveys during meetings for interactive feedback.
Screen Sharing: Allows sharing of the screen or a specific window with participants.
Chat and Reactions: Offers chat messaging and the use of emojis and gestures for reactions.
