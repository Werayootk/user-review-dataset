The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities ü§™ . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version ....

NARROWLY ESCAPED A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I recently experienced a concerning situation during a reservation with Airbnb, prompting me to share a cautionary tale with fellow users. Regrettably, my experience has led me to conclude that Airbnb‚Äôs commitment to customer safety may not align with their public image. Despite raising genuine safety concerns during my stay and providing detailed information, the response from Airbnb‚Äôs support team exhibited a lack of thorough consideration and logical coherence. The decision-making process appeared flawed, with the introduction of logical fallacies and an apparent disregard for the gravity of the issues raised. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Airbnb‚Äôs customer service, as it seems the platform prioritizes financial transactions over the safety and well-being of its users. Consequently, I have chosen to discontinue using Airbnb for future accommodations. I urge potential users to exercise caution when considering Airbnb for their lodging needs. While the platform may offer a wide array of options, my unfortunate commitment to addressing safety concerns promptly and responsibly. It is essential for users to be aware that Airbnb‚Äôs customer support may fall short of expectations when faced with issues that require careful consideration and thorough investigation. The logical fallacies evident in their response, including appeals to ignorance, non sequiturs, and hasty generalizations, highlight a concerning lack of rigor in their decision-making process. Such lapses in reasoning raise questions about the reliability of Airbnb‚Äôs customer support and their ability to handle situations that involve safety and security. In light of these experiences, I strongly caution potential users against relying solely on Airbnb for their lodging needs. Exploring alternative accommodation options with a reputation for prioritizing customer safety and providing robust support mechanisms might be a more prudent choice. While Airbnb has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel and seek accommodations, my recent encounter has revealed a disconcerting aspect of their customer service that cannot be overlooked. As consumers, our safety and well-being should remain paramount, and I believe it is crucial to consider these factors when choosing a platform for lodging arrangements. In conclusion, my recommendation is to approach Airbnb with caution and to carefully evaluate their commitment to safety and customer support. It is my hope that this review serves as a reminder for users to prioritize platforms that consistently uphold the highest standards of service and safety.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T12:39:39-07:00

This kind of false advertising is very disappointing as Airbnb used to be much more transparent. There is a button you can select that gives you a closer number to what you will ultimately pay.

Text (as in 'how to get in' messages) cannot be zoomed in on. Nor can it be copied by a long press. This forces you into all sorts of cludgy work-arounds.

As noted, love the service but make the app more user friendly.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T05:53:45-07:00

In general, it was OK, but when I got a scammer guest who reserved in the wrong place and then lied and said my place was dirty, in order to cancel the reservation and get her money back, the support from Airbnb customer service was terrible. Though I was a ‚ÄúSuperHost‚Äù with all five-star ratings, they believed the guest and gave her all her money back.
I recently tried returning to Airbnb but found the customer service is still inadequate. They give you the runaround endlessly, seemingly trying to wear you out, rather than help you. I am done with hosting on Airbnb. I recommend using FurnishedFinder.Com. They don‚Äôt take a percentage of your rent, but rather a yearly fee of about $150.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T17:28:58-07:00

I had a host mislead me on a listing and when I found out less than 48 hours later and attempted to cancel I was met with a 900 dollar cancelation fee, when I tried to contact AirBnB I was met with a we will reach out to the host and the host refused to give me my money back. Airbnb told me that it was up to the host who had mislead me in the listing to begin with. The real shame is that there are good and honest hosts but the fact that predatory ones are allowed to continue doing business makes it impossible for me to even consider continuing business with them.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T12:31:20-07:00

Aibnb offers no customer support. If you have terrible host or a terrible experience Airbnb will offer you no help, they will stand for the host, and if the host do no want to cancel or refund you will have to take the financial damage or ruin your trip.
Save yourself stress and disappointment, book a hotel, they have someone at the door 24h, professional service, and customer service.
