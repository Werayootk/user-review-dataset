I cannot customise the screen I open to. I keep getting this annoying screen where I have already seen the notifications listed a bazillion times. Also, I can‚Äôt delete the notifications, even if they have been read. It looks cluttered and drives me crazy. 

Even if I click on ‚Äúhide read,‚Äù they pop back up
like a bad carbuncle every time I reopen the app.

Everyone and their mother has an all with phone capabilities. I don‚Äôt need another ersatz phone app.

It used to work great. Since a recent update though, joining a meeting without signing in is a terrible process. When I click the Join link in my email, it no longer puts me directly into the meeting; it makes me enter the Meeting ID and Passcode manually. To do that, I need to copy the ID from my email, switch apps, and paste it into Teams, then switch back to email, copy the passcode‚Ä¶ and AUGH when I switch back to Teams, it has backed out automatically to the Sign In screen, which means my Meeting ID is gone. I literally had to copy the Meeting ID and Passcode into a notes app, put them together as one string of text, copy that text, paste it into the Teams Meeting ID field, then select and cut the Passcode part on its own so that I could paste in both pieces of data that I needed without leaving the Teams app (and losing my progress). Microsoft WHY did you make joining a meeting without signing in so difficult and bad?? I promise you that no matter how annoying you make it, I am not going to sign in on my phone, even though that‚Äôs clearly what you want and what you‚Äôre prioritizing.

The time indicator (red line showing current time) is not the same as system time (it is correct in Teams for Windows, but iOS app is significantly behind schedule (shows 6am at 12pm) it took me some time to notice it‚Äôs only the red bar that is not tracking. This is how I first noticed something was different, but the biggest issue is the app refresh time is broken. Previously I could have the calendar open and it would stay updated with refresh throughout the day, now it does not update. 
The left side does have the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù time (HH:mm) in blue text different from the time markers. It is accurate to the point when the app is opened but does not update. (ie; if I open the app at 11:36 and have the app open, it will still say 11:36 at 12:20) I can not get it to update by selecting calendar or switching between chat/calendar, it will only get the time for calendar at the initial load. I have to force close and restart the application.

I initially thought maybe it would be something with my device, but neither restarting phone, nor uninstalling/reinstalling app has had any effect.

Obviously because it‚Äôs for work I‚Äôll continue to ‚Äúuse‚Äù the application. But this round of ‚Äúbug fixes and enhancements‚Äù is a huge pain in the neck.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-30T09:24:56-07:00
