Chào người bạn đáng mến của tôi !
Tôi đã đọc xong những dòng chữ của bạn .. tuy không hiểu được nhiều nhưng cũng có lẽ cũng hiểu được một chút ý nghĩa về những gì bạn đã viết .. Trước tiên bạn phải nên hiểu rằng : “ không có ngày xưa thì làm sao có ngày nay ? “ … những gì mà chúng ta được thừa hưởng ngày hôm nay là do những khám phá của tổ tiên để lại .. cho nên chúng ta phải nên trân trọng hơn là chê bai những công trình ấy đã bắt nguồn từ thô sơ cho đến hiện đại ..
“ Ăn trái thì phải nhớ đến người trồng cây “ đó là một điều mà bạn phải nên nhớ và luôn cảm ơn đến. “ “ “ tiền nhân “ là những người đã có công xây nước và dựng nước thì đó mới là lẽ phải …
 Tôi xin được phép dành “ năm sao “
cho một công trình vĩ đại mà tiền nhân đã để lại cho chúng ta từ đời này cho đến đời khác .. còn các bạn thì thấy thế nào ? Mỗi người hãy tự trả lời cho chính mình trong tinh thần trân trọng và đoàn kết  …/.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-02T10:12:51-07:00
