One of my guests was continuously using the washing machine without telling me that there was error code, until the washing machine gave up and flooded the first floor.

Whenever I call the airbnb customer service, I receive a generic response of “this is out of my scope, the specialize team will contact you via email”, then it goes back to waiting via email again. To those who are hosting, airbnb is not as safe they sound it to be. When your house is ruined, you are on your own and you dont even know for how long. They dont give you an estimate, they just keep repeating saying, “since this is a big claim, our team is still investigating” - same email everytime.

It is extremely irritating that they hide the real cost until you go to ""reserve"" a room. For example, I found a room in a local city for $81, where a hotel costs about $150. However, when I went to reserve the room, the price jumped to about $206 because of a $90 cleaning fee, $11 taxes, and $24 in an Airbnb service fee. (If the math is wrong, I was approximating). 

This is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t want to have to click on every single room possible in order to find the real price. 

This used to be a great service, but right now it‘s a 0/10. 

Check hotels, motels, beds and breakfasts, or other local innkeepers nearby; there‘s a good chance they may be cheaper than Airbnb. 
You’re also much less likely to be scammed.
My wife has thrice now, picked a room, paid for it, and never heard back from the host. Airbnb refunded her, but it still meant that she was stuck without anywhere to go at nighttime with other places booked out. 

Tl;dr: hidden costs and crazy fees mean that Airbnb is no longer a cost-effective alternative. Coupled with that is the higher risk of scams. Just save yourself a headache, go with a hotel/motel.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-25T11:03:35-07:00
