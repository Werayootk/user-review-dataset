So I attempted 4 different times to book a 2 night stay and each time the hosts asked me to withdraw because they didn’t have updated schedules loaded. So clearly this is stressful by itself. Well I tried a 5th time and this is where the app failed. My search was pretty simple I basically just filtered out extremely expensive places and anything less than 2 bedrooms. Well I found another acceptable place (I thought) I booked and wow it went through. I was on a road trip and got back 3 days later and was showing the bookings to my friends going and realized it was a 1br so I cancelled right away. I was only refunded 2/3 of my money. This was about 3-4 days after the booking and over 6 weeks before the trip. Basically they have horrible policies and a broken search engine. Overall the company shows it doesn’t care for us by not openly showing the “cleaning fees” (turns out they don’t take a percentage of that fee, that’s why all the hosts have MASSIVE cleaning fees) you only see them when you go to check out and find out the cleaning fees are frequently the same cost as the nights stay and in some cases 2-3times that. The least the company could do is average that into the nightly costs. I highly suggest you find a different app to book through.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-08T01:15:42-07:00

Warning to hosts - don’t waste your time with Airbnb. The customer support for a host is horrible. Airbnb erroneously deducted from my earnings and it took 5 tickets and an hour+ each time just to file the ticket and explain THEIR error and robbery. Then wait for a call back and then surprise! Abb closes the ticket without any resolution. And countless hosts are kicked off the site for 1* reviews. Hello! Some people just like to complain. A guest booked ‘in error’ no showed then asked for a refund then gave a 1* review and Airbnb refused to remove the bad review. So that’s why I say don’t bother with the app as a host.

I told them the bug in your system is not my problem and since experience never happened I just want my money back. They closed the tickets every time without refunding me.

Addendum: if you have reservation that you want to give the support guy, good luck. you can’t select the code; so you can’t copy it. 
i don’t know if there might be other problems with the app, but this experience has not left me with a good feeling.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-30T09:54:19-07:00
