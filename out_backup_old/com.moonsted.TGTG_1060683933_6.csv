It‚Äôs a perfect example of what this world needs more of- businesses that look to fill gaps in demand and that can help to fight waste and improve efficiency in our society. As a young student, I‚Äôve relied on this app a lot, 20-30 times, and it has let me down maybe once. I‚Äôve recommended it to almost everyone who‚Äôs in my position. I only hope for it to keep growing and spreading to more restaurants",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-14T11:37:45-07:00

They take days for an agent to reach you via email. They don‚Äôt offer ANY compensation when there‚Äôs an issue that wouldd normally warrant a refund or credit like other businesses! If you dispute the charge for non delivery of service, they block your account!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-14T11:35:44-07:00

Items marked Sold Out, use to show the time it was sold out, I assume, so TGTG customers can try the next day around that sold out time. Now, it‚Äôs only marked sold out. So good luck guessing when to try and catch these deals. The little heart icon for tagging Favorites has been pretty unhelpful. You‚Äôd think that if it was marked Favorites, notifications would pop up when that establishment has something for sale. That doesn‚Äôt happen. All Favorites, does is organize another row of establishments, your Favorites, for you to look at. I don‚Äôt need another row to look at. Now I hardly open this app. Feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-14T10:56:51-07:00
