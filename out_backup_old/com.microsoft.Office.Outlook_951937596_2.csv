I put it at 4 stars because there has been a couple moments where I go back to look for an email, and it is not there. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but it has happened on a couple of occasions.

Swiping to delete an email takes forever compared to gmail. Gmail you can swipe messages as fast as you want and they delete swiftly and effortlessly. Not with outlook. You swipe then you wait for it to delete. Then you can swipe again and you wait for it to delete. Over and over. Sure you can select but a lot of times you‚Äôd like to scroll and just swipe emails away. 
And it takes SO MANY clicks to send email to junk. 
I would really love to see sweep brought to mobile. That would be so handy. 
The killer is video size. It won‚Äôt even let you send a 30 second video in 2024. Eye roll. üôÑ it wants you to upload to their servers first for no reason whatsoever. Well, maybe they want to sell your video data or something. Anyways conspiracy theories aside it‚Äôs clunky and very limited compared to the web version.
