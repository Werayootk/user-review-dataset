Every communication with the support is painful and it feels just easier to switch to another platform even if it’s more expensive or has worse listings just because it feels extremely unsafe to book anything with Airbnb knowing that your are on your own if any issue occurs. My last communication with the support staff included name calling, rude unprofessional style of communication and it took me three tries to finally make it clear for them what was my question about. And still I wasn’t able to receive any useful response about my issue. 
The platform itself is developed very poorly and it’s really hard to find accommodation with such a little amount of filters. A lot of things feel like scam, like new accounts get lower service fees, comparing to other platforms that give you discounts if you stay with them longer and if you book more. 
In general very disappointing service however unfortunately other rental platforms are less popular and most hosts use Airbnb. It’s hard to find an alternative but still might be a better option .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-26T18:54:33-07:00

I went to book an air bnb for 9 people in a place that fits 12.
I was blocked by air bnb from making this booking.
I messaged the host asking if they could override this and they responded “you’ll have to contact air bnb. we are unable to override them from our end. We would be happy to host you though!”
So… even though I have a PERFECT rating and the host wants to make money by having us stay at their place (the whole point of this app) air bnb is going to block me because they have “implemented restrictions that prevent guests from making reservations when the system detects that booking may present higher safety risks”
This is absolutely ridiculous to me. 
Air bnb also says “but you do still have options in finding another booking, as these restrictions don't apply to hotel or private room listings”
The whole reason I started staying at air bnbs is due to it being a bigger space with a kitchen and other amenities at a cheaper than hotels.

That is just horrible to do I paid alot of money for a place I didn’t even get to stay at. Never will I ever do business with shady organizations like this. I urge you folks to do the same. Especially if you have circumstances like mines with a family death and airbnb not giving you your money back.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-16T15:20:42-07:00

10703927934,Ojkingsom,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id515269366,23.50,1,Used to love it. Now it's ridiculous,I have never had an issue with Airbnb until recently. I have kept being denied being able to book and NOBODY KNOWS WHAT MY RESTRICTION IS. I keep being told to verify my identity and it's already verified. The last time I booked was 2021. Now this year I need a larger space to travel to a quick local destination and BOOM they think it's a party . It's kids and two chaperones. I'm over it no one is willing to understand in support and even the hosts that I was honest and intentional with are confused on why I can't book. It's SICKENING. Because now I have to try and book hotels rooms near a busy area which will cost way more. I'm disappointed and won't be using them until they fix that bug.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-16T10:34:38-07:00
