My company uses Gmail and using this Gmail app for mobile really provides the tightest user experience over other mobile email apps. 
I really liked Google‚Äôs Inbox email app for mobile, but that‚Äôs being killed off soon, so I would LOVE it if the Gmail mobile team would take the snoozing design feature of Inbox and incorporate it into the Gmail app. 
With Inbox, I can bring up the snooze menu with a swipe, whereas in Gmail it takes 3 separate taps to bring up the snooze menu (1st world problem, I know). 
Speaking of swipes, why am I given only one option for swiping emails with the Gmail app: archive or delete? With Inbox I could swipe right to archive and swipe left to snooze. 
This Gmail app would receive a 4 stars if I could swipe to snooze, and 5 stars if I could swipe right to archive AND swipe left to snooze.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-09T18:14:00-07:00

However, recently, Google has really been trying to push iPhone users to use the Chrome browser instead of Safari.  I have tried Chrome in the past and just did not want to use it on my device and uninstalled it. So, I un-toggled the ‚ÄúOpen with‚Äù button when asked if I wanted to open email links with Chrome.  But, each and every single time I clicked a link, it still asked me which browser I wanted to use, despite asking the Gmail app to NOT ask me about my browser again.

This happened every time, whether I had just updated the app or not. I understand that Google wants me to use their products (which I do, most of the time), but when you give me the option to choose my browser for the long term and I do, there is no reason to shamefully plug your other products. If I wanted to use Chrome, I would.

I only use Meet on my phone maybe once every two weeks or so. I do prefer it by far to Zoom or GoToMeeting, but it‚Äôs more usable and practical on my laptop, where I use it every day. 

Given that inserting Meet into Gmail is a deviation from the essential function of reading one‚Äôs mail, and the relative rarity of its use for which I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm an uncommon use case, there‚Äôs no reason to have a tab for Meet always at the bottom of my emails list.
