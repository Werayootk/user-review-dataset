Some may argue that TikTok can be unsafe, which is true, but it‚Äôs not as bad as you think. You can report and block people, and you can also make your account private so people can‚Äôt see the videos you make and they have to request to follow you. You can comment on videos, unless the person who made the video decides to turn off comments. There‚Äôs is also an option to privately chat with people, but I‚Äôm sure you can turn that off if you want to. If someone says anything uncomfortable, you can always block them too. The reason I give it four stars is mainly just bc of my own opinion. I think that TikTok can be negative, they‚Äôll joke about anything and everything (mainly talking about gen-z) which can be tiring and not very nice if they‚Äôre making fun of personalities or looks. TikTok is also very addicting and can ruin your attention span, so do yourself a favor and SET A TIME LIMIT.

Although I do see so many young kids in this app. I do not recommend this app for kids 10 and under. There are videos that can have really inappropriate things shown. Also having pages (if there public which you can have your account private) your bound to get some hate. There are lots of people I have seen giving hate to people for no reason. The percentage of hate on this app is huge so if your a sensitive person I would suggest thinking it over before downloading this app. There is also lots of songs that go viral that could have inappropriate language in that you probably don‚Äôt want to have your kid hearing.

I never understood why they would do this but now I do, TikTok doesn‚Äôt want us to tell people about our history and they don‚Äôt want us to talk about how we should get equal rights. Now trust me, Other black creators and I have tried to protest on the app by changing our profile pictures to the black power fists, we have also been fighting for lgbtq lives as well and TikTok doesn‚Äôt change. On May 19,2020 Black creators and I have done something called a blackout and we used the hashtag #blackout2020 and TikTok didn‚Äôt change, So today June 19,2020 aka Juneteenth we as a black community are deleting this app and rating it one star because TikTok doesn‚Äôt want to change.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-06-19T04:53:06-07:00"},{"id":"5873115842","userName":"123 I love me","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id225543536","version":"15.7.2","score":4,"title":"Hello","text":"I enjoy the app very much but there are a few things I would recommend to get better reviews. First is for the people that don‚Äôt have one thousand or more followers should be able to go live! We still work very hard for our followers and Mose small Tik Tok account don‚Äôt get on the foryoupage. Next I think that all hate pages should get immediately removed. Some hate pages are not terrible but still are hurtful. But there are other hate pages that say very mean and hateful stuff that can affect other people greatly. I have reported an account countless times and so have my friends. It is still up hurting and affecting people and I just think Tik Tok should be more aware of the people that are just on the app to spread hate. And the very last thing is that more small account should get on the for you page and get more views. For example I have three account and one I get many views and likes and on the other no matter what hashtags I use or what sound I still seam to get 5 likes. I think more small accounts should get attention because most people work just as hard as every other big tik toner and still don‚Äôt get the desired likes and views. Please improve these.

The more you spend on this app the more you waste that precious time, doing other things that could be worth it. I've taken a step to stop being addicted to Social Media, but others haven't. Everyone has social media so much that it's essential to life, making friends, and just talking. I understand that deleting your social medias practically cut off all of things, but if you do, you just might find something that can be worth your time or change your life for the better. If it's taking the time to study for an exam needed to graduate, or spending time with your friends or family, it doesn't matter what you do as long as it's worth your time. You've probably heard this in another way, such as \"get off the phone and go do something\", but you've never had a reason as to why you should, until now. So if you're reading this, Find something worth your while, and even delete this app. After all, You might just benefit from doing so.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-12T15:56:34-07:00"},{"id":"9986389121","userName":"tennis68","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40568101","version":"29.6.0","score":5,"title":"I don‚Äôt just like TikTok- I ADORE TikTok","text":"Like so many people I joined TikTok on a whim during the Covid crisis in 2020.

At this point tiktok makes you pay for exposure. Good content isnt enough anymore to develop a following making it harder for people without money to grow. Its practically impossible to reach 1k  followers without spending money. It cost me over 100US Dollars just to get my brand name out there and it left me with 240 ish followers. My personal account used to get thousands of views including positive engagement. If I can make good content consistently and grow organically less than a year ago. Then its only safe to assume that tik tok is drowning out the free users now. I understand they have to make money but they were doing fine beforehand and it seems like they have just got greedy ever since the promote feature became a thing. Small businesses and new startups resort to social media for growth and it used to be a good tool for people just starting out making original content.
