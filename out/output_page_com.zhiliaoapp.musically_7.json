This app is amazing. But I have found out, that some people that I know, are making different accounts, and TikTok is giving them more likes. My friend used to have at least 2 k likes, until she made more accounts and got even more. The second thing is the bullying. Many people are bullying and it’s now getting to the point where I’m wanting to hurt myself. I wish that TikTok would actually listen to reports, instead of saying, “Sorry, there’s nothing wrong with this user”. Then, there’s the part we’re it’s now blowing up your phone, saying, “This persons live” or saying, “You have 12 new notifications”, “This person liked your video”, “This person followed you”, and when it does this, it shows so many notifications, waking me up in the middle of the night when I’m trying to sleep! I’m getting really annoyed with this. One time, I was playing my favorite game, a notification from TikTok turned on, and it immediately logged me out of the game, making me leave my friends game!

And even if they are made aware, how exactly are they supposed to report a profile they can’t see? And if they’re not a “celebrity” it doesn’t matter?

But it’s not not just the guidelines, it’s the fact that they don’t seem to enforce them equally for everyone.  My account was taken down for sexual content and nudity, when that really didn’t apply to my content and especially not compared to so much of the content you see on there with actual sexual activity and nudity.  I’ve known some other creators who have experienced the same and it seems to happen more and more.  TikTok seems to have its favorites (huge creators of course) and does not treat everyone equally.  I hate to say all this because I dedicated so much of my time to being a serious content creator on there, respecting everyone and the guidelines (so I thought) but with what just recently happened and also losing out on extra income I needed and being treated unfairly I’m pretty disappointed with what the app has become.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-11T07:29:38-07:00"},{"id":"8926331068","userName":"ct tulli","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1114448534","version":"25.4.0","score":4,"title":"TikTok","text":"I’ve been on Tik Tok for quite a long while so i’ve finally decided to write a review. I love TikTok, I really do. It has a lot of fun videos, and the algorithm is amazingly accurate. Most of the people are kind. Some may argue that TikTok can be unsafe, which is true, but it’s not as bad as you think. You can report and block people, and you can also make your account private so people can’t see the videos you make and they have to request to follow you. You can comment on videos, unless the person who made the video decides to turn off comments. There’s is also an option to privately chat with people, but I’m sure you can turn that off if you want to. If someone says anything uncomfortable, you can always block them too. The reason I give it four stars is mainly just bc of my own opinion. I think that TikTok can be negative, they’ll joke about anything and everything (mainly talking about gen-z) which can be tiring and not very nice if they’re making fun of personalities or looks. TikTok is also very addicting and can ruin your attention span, so do yourself a favor and SET A TIME LIMIT.

However over time, my saved pocket has gotten very filled, and I can’t seem to find certain ones that I wished to save for later. It just all gets lost and I can’t seem to keep track of everything. I think subcategories of the saved pocket would be a great idea. Make them into different categories and allow us to save the cooking vids to the pocket we want to title cooking or the POV vids to the pocket we title inspiration or POV. Just along those lines, I think the app would improve by so much.

However, seeing black creators (I hope using the word black isn’t considered inappropriate on this review like it is on the app itself) being used, not being paid equally, and shadow banned for speaking HISTORICAL truths is why I decided to write this review. It’s disheartening how boldly this app supports racism all while non people of color are taking content from black (oops) I mean, melanated folks content without crediting them. I’ve seen more melanated creators endure more mistreatment from an app that without tik tok dances, no one would know what to do with themselves. I find it interesting the terms “white power” and “white supremacy” can just be typed freely but the term “black success” is flagged as “inappropriate”. We get it. You don’t want black people to be successful unless your hands are dug in them for money. It’s how the country was built anyway. Remember, karma is real and you won’t stay on top forever. MySpace and Vine died off too. Only difference is, Tik Tok only values anyone who isn’t black and those that will lie to appease those with fragile egos.

I miss the old tik tok, back when it was mainly a platform for cosplayers, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. Don’t get me wrong, I love animal vids and stuff like that, but I mean. It’s starting to seem more and more like Snapchat it and fb stories. Like, it used to be fun and diverse, now it’s more just like; one chick on there does a dance move gains a couple thousand followers then EVERYBODY does that dance move and it’s all you see and then they upload another vid with a different dance and the cycle repeats. I understand there are “trends” but seriously. If this app is just gonna be everyone doing exactly the same thing everyone else is doing than what’s the point of having the app?

I really enjoy making videos and being able to meet loads of other people from around the world :) however I do have some issues with the app and I feel like you could improve them. First and foremost, your customer support should be either a number or email, not support tickets. One time my live got banned for no reason ( I was literally sitting there drinking almond milk for 10 minutes ) and it took 2 weeks to get my livestream back. Also i recently got a new phone because my other one was damaged completely. I also got a new number. Because of this I can’t get into my account whatsoever and I’ve sent about 5 support tickets trying to get my account back and I can’t. I have 170k followers that I have worked so very hard for and I feel that your support ticket system isn’t a sufficient way to communicate back and forth with your users.

You have to dig deep to even find comments and then it only shows you a small portion of them because when you get past 20, there is a tab that shows “people you may know” instead of the rest of your comments. The “people you may know” tab pops up constantly too, because even if you have contacts shut off it STILL accesses them. It uploaded all my phone contacts & Fb friends despite never having that feature turned on & intentionally double checking it was off. Invasion of privacy for sure. They  updated the home page/inbox layout too. So you can’t just click the inbox icon and see “all activity”. You have to click like 2-3 things to get to the “all activity” tab, then select comments or likes etc. even then, it’s giving thousands of unnecessary notifications so the ones you want to see are buried.

I have seen dance videos, fan pages, food videos, tutorials, and even people trying to support there smal businesses. Although I do see so many young kids in this app. I do not recommend this app for kids 10 and under. There are videos that can have really inappropriate things shown. Also having pages (if there public which you can have your account private) your bound to get some hate. There are lots of people I have seen giving hate to people for no reason. The percentage of hate on this app is huge so if your a sensitive person I would suggest thinking it over before downloading this app. There is also lots of songs that go viral that could have inappropriate language in that you probably don’t want to have your kid hearing.

I have fallen in love with it because it’s the only app I use since quarantine. But there should be a few changes such as who can see videos. like when you post a video for only your friends to see, but that should be customizable. We should be able to put who can see our tik tok out of our friends. Kinda like Instagram. Another thing is some times I want to make a video so I save the audio. But I save so many I can’t even find it. There should be multiple folders so when you save them for example, dance sounds, challenges sounds, duet sounds, react sounds, ect. Also I’m not sure if this only happened’s to me but when I’m on my FYP then I want to see my following, when I swipe to the left it automatically refreshes my following page. Witch is annoying because I want to see the videos. I should be able to refresh like on my fyp not automatically do it for me. Also one last thing there should be a bigger limit to your bio and caption. Maybe just like 20 or 30 characters more.

I also feel as though videos that were not harmful in any shape, way or form get deleted/taken down and it’s unfair to the creators who may have spent some time on it. During this time, many people are speaking up about the injustices happening (blm) and lots of those videos get taken down when they have not violated any of the guidelines which I personally think is unfair to not only the creator but the people who are also largely invested in the blm movement.

But there are other hate pages that say very mean and hateful stuff that can affect other people greatly. I have reported an account countless times and so have my friends. It is still up hurting and affecting people and I just think Tik Tok should be more aware of the people that are just on the app to spread hate. And the very last thing is that more small account should get on the for you page and get more views. For example I have three account and one I get many views and likes and on the other no matter what hashtags I use or what sound I still seam to get 5 likes.

And what happened to baby Ariel sence the app as change she has change but she was such a icon on Musically but now the icon is Russian princess😥 like you say this is a kid friendly app but if someone post something bad like cursing you should delete it right away cause you say it’s 12 and older so why have parents even elderly people post bad, inappropriate content for the young ones to see😔. Please see this and take it into consideration you, we need to make this app better for people to in joy and not feel disgusted please and thank you.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-02-23T06:58:25-07:00"},{"id":"10801055982","userName":"sunny.fastswimer","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1348647702","version":"32.8.0","score":3,"title":"Inappropriate and insulting comments","text":"My parents say this app is a problem I love this app but I kinda agree with what my parents are saying about this app. It brings so many people down and makes so many memories at the same time, I think if we would have a nicer community on this app and not inappropriate videos and lives, I think this app would be so much better and more appropriate for 12+ right now of what I have seen and heard about it I would think it would be a 17+ app. There can be relatable videos and funny videos that’s a good thing but how people hate and post mean things about others is creating kids being depressed and looking at other people lives and asking their selves “why do I look like this” or “why can’t I look like that” or something. There is some people on this app that are telling people that they are perfect and stuff I think that is ok but having people comment on videos and saying rude and inappropriate stuff is not ok. I love this app a lot but I had to delete it because so many people were saying insulting things about me. I would love to have a better and more appropriate version of this app so I can redownload it and see more things that make my day.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2024-01-08T20:44:47-07:00"},{"id":"10250795219","userName":"imuglyandimproud310","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1272899079","version":"30.7.0","score":1,"title":"An app that changes your life in a bad way","text":"I've tried to give TikTok a shot at being on my phone, and after a couple of weeks i found myself endlessly scrolling through whatever was recommended to me, and i took it of my phone because i realized that scrolling through this app makes time fly by, time that is VERY limited to one's life. The more you spend on this app the more you waste that precious time, doing other things that could be worth it. I've taken a step to stop being addicted to Social Media, but others haven't. Everyone has social media so much that it's essential to life, making friends, and just talking. I understand that deleting your social medias practically cut off all of things, but if you do, you just might find something that can be worth your time or change your life for the better. If it's taking the time to study for an exam needed to graduate, or spending time with your friends or family, it doesn't matter what you do as long as it's worth your time. You've probably heard this in another way, such as \"get off the phone and go do something\", but you've never had a reason as to why you should, until now. So if you're reading this, Find something worth your while, and even delete this app. After all, You might just benefit from doing so.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-12T15:56:34-07:00"},{"id":"9986389121","userName":"tennis68","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40568101","version":"29.6.0","score":5,"title":"I don’t just like TikTok- I ADORE TikTok","text":"Like so many people I joined TikTok on a whim during the Covid crisis in 2020. I never planned on posting a video instead I found such joy, laughing and sometimes crying and getting ideas from all of the wonderful TikToks that I was watching. Slowly I began to post a TikTok here or there. I also began to start making a few friends that I noticed were commenting on my videos and I would comment on their‘s. It didn’t take long before I became very excited about posting TikTok videos and getting new ideas and seeing all the wonderful ideas that were out there in this amazing community of creators. I have made such an amazing incredible amount of people all over the world, people I truly consider real friends today. This was completely unexpected. I also have found that this desire to perform inside of me which I’ve had since I was a little kid has been lit again and I love it. I LOVE this app. I absolutely love it. It is a bit addictive and it does take up a lot of time but I can truly say I am so happy that I am a member of this fantastic wonderful community.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-31T21:00:47-07:00"},{"id":"9974451657","userName":"Jamepie18","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1201098806","version":"29.6.0","score":5,"title":"Love u","text":"This is changing my life.

The only issue I have is when I post abt the grooming of our children by SOME (and I do mean SOME, I love all humans and not ALL of the LGBTQ community is guilty of doing so BUT my friends, MANY ARE) we HAVE to use our voices, our platform to protect them. Plz watch my videos carefully b4 u feel u should take them down. I would NEVER bully Anyone, and I supported them all my life, but there are many now hiding behind the protection that is the LGBTQ community to get to our children. I’m begging u to see the difference and allow me to express how desperately important it is that we use our voices to protect them. This platform is going to change the world. Plz allow me to express the importance. Sending all my love and gratitude to you.!!! Peace and love friends!!!❤️❤️🤜🤛 TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD!!

I despise the lives, especially the asmr ones, which honestly if they didn’t exist I wouldn’t be as miffed as I am. Every time I hear those disgusting mouth sounds, and click “not interested” only to get another one ten minutes later a part of me dies. A part of me also died when the format for likes got changed to where instead of the notification in the inbox being cleared when you click on the inbox, you now have to click the little activities folder if you have more than two separate notifications. Every update the app developers give us sucky and inconvenient changes. What happened to product testing? Literally nobody likes the lives or the inbox thing. If people want to watch live videos good for them, and I get that it’s being pushed because this app is run by money hungry ceos who don’t actually care about the usability of the app as long as people still go on it, but Jesus Christ just let us filter them out. You’re not going to make any money off of the people that would use the anti live filter anyways, we’re not going to watch them no matter how many times a dumb live pops up.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-02T23:45:38-07:00"},{"id":"9266513866","userName":"JRoushOfficial","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1333441169","version":"26.7.0","score":3,"title":"Okay overall. Promote feature kills free users chances tho","text":"What could I possibly know about a multi billion dollar app right? Take my words with a grain of salt and do your own research. At this point tiktok makes you pay for exposure. Good content isnt enough anymore to develop a following making it harder for people without money to grow. Its practically impossible to reach 1k  followers without spending money. It cost me over 100US Dollars just to get my brand name out there and it left me with 240 ish followers. My personal account used to get thousands of views including positive engagement. If I can make good content consistently and grow organically less than a year ago. Then its only safe to assume that tik tok is drowning out the free users now. I understand they have to make money but they were doing fine beforehand and it seems like they have just got greedy ever since the promote feature became a thing. Small businesses and new startups resort to social media for growth and it used to be a good tool for people just starting out making original content. Being original and interesting isnt enough now.. the standard is “pay for view” now unless you already had a large following before the change.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-07T18:18:28-07:00"},{"id":"9252089425","userName":"Kitty Cat Golden.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1393166070","version":"26.7.0","score":2,"title":"Nope I am sorry but you need to put a lot of work🙁","text":"OK listen don’t skip this cause I know you have a Lotta haters but most Lakers which is good.

The toxic community has bulled an 11 year old into killing him self. The people who operate tik tok are not fair with whom they force to follow the community guidelines. There are pedophiles everywhere who still have a platfor. If you post anything that the mass community does not agree with on the app, they do their damned best to ruin your life, and ban you, but do not hold others to the same messed up standard. Young children are on this app and getting their brains completely melted and becoming brainwashed.
