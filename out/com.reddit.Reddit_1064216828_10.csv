11032398540,Transfering Music,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1064790762,2024.10.1,4,Reddit is enjoyable‚Ä¶,But the new swipe left and right with the swipe up for comments isn‚Äôt really adaptable. With videos or post with pics if I keep swiping it swipes to a whole new post and just throws everything off. If yall bring back the swipe up and down for new post it would be better or have a feature where it can be disabled for certain users. That continuous swiping motion shouldn‚Äôt even have been added in the first place making things harder to work for no reason. Everything just seems all choppy and out of order with the swipe left and right.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-11T03:36:09-07:00

Reddit needs to look into this as its Tik Tok Creators doing the false reporting to cover up the way they manipulate gifters/ followers. We shine  light onto them through these recordings is the reason they are working so hard to take them down!
