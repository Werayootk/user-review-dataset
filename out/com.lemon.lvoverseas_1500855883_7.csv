 When the reverse percentage was around 80% or 90%, it stops abruptly and says that it “couldn’t reverse the video”. It also takes way longer than usual to even get to 80% in the first place. For some, it stops and just turns the whole project into a black screen until you reopen the app again. And thats a pain in the behind especially when it didn’t save very recent changes beforehand.

I thought it wad just my slow Wi-fi, but after checking on Reddit, many others recently aren’t so lucky either. I updated the app hoping for an optimization on this, but no luck.

It’s very simple to use coming from someone who’s never had access to video editing tools like these. I wish that you had access to everything without paying for Pro but that’s how they have to make their money since the app is free, so whatever and there’s not a ton of stuff that you don’t have access to.  Even without Pro there are no ads which is awesome because I’m sick of free apps having ads so that’s part of why I love it so much. Also having access to templates is really nice because it allows you to do things that maybe you hadn’t figured out how to do on your own.

I’m trying to edit a video of me, but my head is turning left and right, which makes it hard to make the overlay move with my head. maybe CapCut already has this feature where you can move and rotate the overlay at the same time and I just haven’t figured out how to do it yet maybe. but if it doesn’t it would be really nice if you could move and rotate the overlay at the same time, thanks for reading!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-28T09:51:59-07:00

If your pondering on getting this app after getting a terrible app I suggest to not even look at the reviews cause this is the best app ever!!! ^^

Out of the two editing apps I have (KineMaster and CapCut) I pick CapCut not only cause I have more experience with it, but it's more reliable!

That is, if you know how to work it. 

There are many flaws in this app. 

The shakes, they aren’t really good. You need to add overlay after overlay after overlay… and it lags the more you add. It gets glitchy and will not process the video and show the progress. 

It would be nice to get actual transitions instead of sappy transitions that make the video awkward… And the shakes? Don’t get me started on those. 

They are horrible. Probably the biggest issue for me, and editor. You want a nice shake for a transition or to make the edit seem better and a little professional? CapCut isn’t exactly something you can depend on for that. 

You want to add panning? Make it seem just a bit more dramatic or feel like it needs movement? CapCut ain’t it. 

You wanna add a transition? Gotta add overlays and let it glitch. 

You want tiles? Oof, sounds like a you problem. 

You want a simple text animation? Maybe a glow, or just make the words come in one by one like in those good edits you see online? 

Go somewhere else, maybe some other app may have it cause CapCut sure doesn’t!

So many improvements needed. You’d expect a big editing app to be a little better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-02T08:46:33-07:00

Also I’m gonna mention graphs again because they would make the app a lot better to use for editing. A lot of people also want graphs not just me.

One of the best video editors (if you pay for the pro version) I’m never going back to splice, you can email splice and they don’t give two ****s about you. The only thing that CapCut can approve on (to me) is to have a button to changed the volume of all the clips together. For an 2 and half minute long video (with lots of cuts) can take up to an hour… an HOUR! To change all the volumes on all the clips. You have a sliding scale for volume that’s finicky. Want the volume up to 400? Be prepared to have it always go one 399…398… 403… 402. Then you get the volume to 400 and lift your finger and the slightest graze in any direction will change it. So you have to go back and try again and eventually get it to 400. Then time for the next 1.2 second clip.

And they had a TikTok account that got banned a few hours or days ago and someone unbanned it. TikTok banned it for looking through peoples photos. Now you may be wondering what’s the big deal? Well say that you have photos of your face and other peoples face’s they could use those to pretend to be YOU!!! I loved CAPCUT until I heard that. I don’t know if it’s 100% true but I’m switching to a different editing app. That’s not ok for them to be looking at your photos like what? The only reason I rated this a four is so more people can see what awful thing it can do.

Third, sometimes I can’t edit any of my edits without kicking me from the app. Fourth, I can’t edit certain edits without it black, and it’s really annoying and just ends up kicking me from the app. So if you could, pls fix those glitches it’s really annoying, and I almost broke my phone because I got so mad at the app for those things.

I was harassed on both apps, and I’m not redownloading them to live through the horror again. I suggest you fix this problem.

I think its good for beginners to even more advanced editors with the same app!

Critques:
The few things to make this app even better would be for users to be able to favorites animations, saving colors, and image/video quality!

Favoriting animations, this is so the editing process goes a little faster, as if a transition you use is at the end of the list you have to scroll all the way and then select, whereas favoriting animation similar to favoriting effects would make that less of a hassle! (both text and clip animations)

Coloring, being able to save a custom made color would be a life saver as color picking can get annoying and tedious rather than just saving a custom palette!

Clip quality, I’ve notice that with all of the clips i’ve cropped in-app, the quality will go down drastically which is a problem. I am unsure if the app developers can fix this themselves but, every time i have to crop a clip, i always have to leave the app and crop the clip in my photos app.

I love that everything is 100% free because I really don’t want to pay for a professional editing app. However, there’s only so much you can do with CapCut since everything consists of presets. It would be great if you could include options to make your own transitions, mask layers, animations, and import fonts. I also find it very frustrating that you can’t use combo and in/out animations at the same time for text and you can’t use animations on effects. The velocity/speed settings are also very glitchy and don’t create smooth videos. These are just a few suggestions that I really hope you take into consideration.

Grouping audio and overlay because maybe you want to animate a lot of pieces and need to copy that, or you might want to put more pieces, along with grouping audio because after I extract an audio then edit it, I will have to move that a long way to the desired part of the video I wanted to put it in.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-25T13:01:14-07:00

-Capcut Pro. I do think adding Capcut Pro was a good way to make money/give people new effects, but I sort of preferred it when it was just free. Not many people buy Capcut Pro either way, it’s just there with extra flashy effects. Now I'm not saying you should remove it, I think Capcut Pro is a good way to get money, but it could have a more promotional way to get people to buy it.

-The Ability to do something. I will say the controls are easy to learn and easy to do, but something you can do on, let's use Alight Motion and Video Star (Pro as well) for an example, you can not do on Capcut. I wish you could, but you can’t. I know those apps like Alight Motion and VSP are supposed to be premium editing apps, but I wish you could do some stuff like that on Capcut. Also sliding into the topic of Capcut Pro, it's not one of those apps like Video Star where it is basically impossible to edit without the paid features, which I like about this app.

Almost every template has started to do this. I think that it is just a massive bug instead of placing those filters behind a paywall without telling anyone.
