I try to fix it by exiting the app completely but then it happens again it is extremely irritating because my iPhone needs to charge so if you want me to use your app more often then you need to fix that so I don‚Äôt have to take an hour pause to let my phone charge. Other than that I love the app I wish it wouldn‚Äôt randomly quit on me mid video also, stop flagging random YouTubers they Are the only reason you are where you are today check if what you are striking then think why you are taking a innocent video down for doing absolutely nothing. To the people:If you want this app buy it however comma it has some flaws you can inspire others with your words but be careful of the audience you are posting to üëâüèºüëâüèº","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-01-02T12:57:04-07:00"},{"id":"10129911904","userName":"ALANA GAMBINO","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id173988222","version":"18.27.3","score":1,"title":"STOP TAKING DOWN SAFE CHANNELS.","text":"so many channels many people love and enjoy are being taken down one after the other, despite them being completely safe, and all of their appeals are being rejected. the reason for all of them being for \"promoting eating disorders,\" which is absolutely FALSE. instead of actually taking care of the thousands of channels that DO promote eating disorders, you take down the ones that do nothing wrong. they put so much hard work into their videos and worked so hard to grow their channels, and you wrongfully take their channels down and ruin all of their hard work. not just all of their subscribers are heartbroken that all of our favorite channels are being wrongfully taken down, the channel creators are crushed as well, especially since their appeals are all being rejected and all of their hard work and effort is GONE, despite them doing NOTHING wrong. why don't you take down the channels that actually break your rules instead of screwing over the ones that are safe??","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-11T16:02:09-07:00"},{"id":"2651644663","userName":"Lovelanüíï","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id821020514","version":"13.20","score":5,"title":"I‚Äôve never had problems with this app before so I‚Äôm kinda disappointed","text":"Just today I was listening to music on the app and out of no where the screen turns black but the music continued to play. I then click out of what I was listening to and restarted my phone, that helped fix that problem but then I went to my like list (I mostly have music on it for easy access). So I started listening to the music on my like list and whenever a video is done playing it atomically changes to the next video on my like list like it supposed to but whenever it goes to the next video my my list it freezes but still the audio continues to play.

No fix from Google","text":"[23 Oct 2022] Continuing terrible performance on Premium account. The app just freezes a few seconds into each video, and needs to be restarted manually. See complaint details below. No fix or response from Google. App updates have not made any difference.  Perhaps this has something to do with iOS. Maybe the upcoming iOS 16.1 release will fix it. Let‚Äôs see. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n[initial review] Until recently, this was an excellent app. Now it freezes arbitrarily, and won‚Äôt restart until I manually fidget with the play position, even on very fast networks. It‚Äôs not a problem with the device, either, this is an iPhone 14 Pro Max running the latest iOS. No other apps are having problems, it‚Äôs just YT Premium. Reinstalling the app hasn‚Äôt helped. I‚Äôve sent feedback a dozen times or more, but there‚Äôs been no fix or reply or mention of a workaround, even though updates have been issued. I hope this is addressed soon, so I can go back to giving this app five stars.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-23T15:25:54-07:00"},{"id":"6569223599","userName":"Boss Hawes","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id218734722","version":"15.42.2","score":4,"title":"Paradigm shift","text":"I definitely recommend this app. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in any way an understatement to say that this app has completely changed the entertainment landscape for better or worse. Many attempts have been made to imitate, copy or replicate the success of this app, all to no avail.  This app gives a voice to many humans who were figuratively dumb for all of the prior history of media. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs an understatement to say this app is literally power for the powerless, hope for the  hopeless, faith for the faithless, strength for the weak, breakfast for the starving, and much much more. Other than the wide spread use of the internet itself, this app has had the most profound effect on society any Jeff could possibly imagine. \n   All that being said there are way too many adds on it now.

Wanna see the comments on your video? Well, it‚Äôs right there, you just have to open it, and there‚Äôs one special guy who‚Äôs comment gets slapped on the face of the menu, how is this comment chosen? Who knows. What was the problem with the way the comment section looked? Now what we get is a tiny menu, and huge video suggestions under that, that just, kind of end. It‚Äôs jarring almost, you expect the scroll to be infinite, almost.
