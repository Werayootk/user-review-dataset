Usually not because it‚Äôll spoil, but because quality standards demand it.
The retailers who get it set aside the ‚Äúspoils‚Äù at the end of the day & make them available here at a big discount (think ‚Äúday old bread store‚Äù but for a lot more than bread).
But there are some who just use this app as a gimmick to get customers to come in & try them out. You‚Äôre not saving anything - they just give you things off the shelf like any other customer, and without much in the way of savings. Once I get those, I just avoid them going forward.

I will say that the concept behind the app is awesome; we waste so much food in this country, and I live in LA, so the issue is amplified. That being said, the execution of this app has room for major improvements.

1. Variety - I guess it depends on where you live, but about 80% of the restaurant options available to me are donuts. And I live in the heart of LA. I don‚Äôt understand the limited options? 

2. Transparency - It would be awesome if we could see WHY a restaurant has a particular rating. I want to see how other‚Äôs experiences went.  

3. Alignment - I‚Äôm finding that some vendors don‚Äôt necessarily align with the whole fighting food waste movement. For 3 of my 5 pickups, the employees just ran around the shop finding random things to throw in the bag, that weren‚Äôt even expired or bad. I think some vendors take advantage of users and are just on the app to make a quick buck. It‚Äôs really unfortunate and TGTG should screen users for this when we rate the pickup experience. 

Overall, a wonderful concept. I just really wish it was deployed better because it seriously has amazing potential.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-24T20:19:26-07:00
