I also lost a lot of coins because it kicks me out all the time. I even have full bars, so it isn’t a Wi-Fi thing. It also is saying connecting or something in the middle of a round then it says I ran out of time and I already just lost. I once made the 8 ball in because I was supposed to then it stayed I ran out of time when I just started my turn. Then the player I was versing hit it in and he won.

What I have an issue with is the unfair advantage of players ranked 189 or 161 who I ranked 36 am paired to play with resulting in me losing and spending more of my personal income to replenish the tokens I loose from playing “pros”. I feel very ripped off and would really like if you consider people who want to enjoy your game fairly.

I decided to download it again, and remembered why I decided to delete it. The game does not have any realistic physics, it is terribly scripted and unrealistic. For example, my cue ball is blocked by the opponent’s balls and I decide to hit my ball from the wall, and then this circus begins, the ball flies in some incredible direction, by some miracle it touches the black ball, as a result, 2 enemy balls are pocketed and pocketed black ball. And believe me, this is only one of a million cases that happened during my gameplay of this game. And yes, I play this game very well, so there is no point in accusing me of being a bad player.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-25T02:54:42-07:00

Once you manage to sign in using their broken sign-in process, before you can even start the game, it takes about 5 minutes to click through all of the various screens that come up, begging you to spend real-world money on the game. Again, this is before you can play the game for a single second. Once you do play, you’re hit with more screens begging you to buy things. I have to close at least 10 “offers” for every game I play.
