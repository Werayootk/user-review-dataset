It would just be a nice addition.  For Nine ball mode, could you add where you have to call your shot.  The game losses it‚Äôs strategy of playing defensive shots when you can use the guideline to sneak it in and just smash everything and hope you make a ball.  10 ball would be a fun addition too.

If you‚Äôve ever watched real pool, rarely do pros fluke the 9. Two, the phenomenon of throw is not induced. If I hit a ball with left spin, the ball it first contacts is thrown to the right. This is not in the game. And three, there is no courtesy. This is not as big a deal, but if I play indirectly, (bank shots, kick shots) I expect some of my more skilled opponents to do the same. I‚Äôve played level 300s in 500 coin games who have potted 70 million balls and they still don‚Äôt play indirect when I do.

Now I have had the same issue as before...  they make it impossible to contact them (purposefully I am sure)... I‚Äôd like to get my bankroll restored (see below)... twice in the last two months I accidentally touched the screen and a game started playing and by the time I realized it I had pretty much lost. 

Here is my previous review: (same story different day)

Totally dig the game but the interface has a fatal flaw... if you accidentally touch your screen wrong while trying to swipe to a specific pool casino, it can wipe out your bankroll that you've worked long and hard on building up. 

Some genius automatically put the casino equal to your bankroll as the starting point each time. So if you have $101,000 it offers you the $100,000 buy-in as the starting point. So if you accidentally touch your screen or swipe wrong you get loaded into that game and if you lose... tough crap.

So... being that is incredibly frustrating I probably will not play a game I actually enjoy... what's the purpose?

On top of that, I cannot find a tech support contact to see about restoring a game that not only did I not mean to play, but I didn't even know I was playing until it was too late and the table was virtually cleared.

In the middle of game play, it cuts completely out. You‚Äôre back to the main screen which is loading. Sometimes you return to the game, sometimes you don‚Äôt. So you‚Äôve just lost coins 
It can take forever to earn bucks. I only have 8 and it‚Äôs been like that for the past year. 
The spinning wheel at the beginning will never let you win anything higher than 250. Most of the times you‚Äôll land on something less than that. 
You can aim directly at a pocket with the correct amount of speed and the ball still doesn‚Äôt go in. This can be confusing to new players that need practice to help them on the real billiards game. 
The conversations could be opened up for all players instead of just friends. But I understand that is the game‚Äôs way of making money. You have to purchase a packet with pre-written words. That‚Äôs annoying. I would give the game a 5 star if this allowed you to talk freely because it‚Äôs more fun communicating with people that are going through the same thing as you while playing. 
However, as you continue to play, you are matched up according to who‚Äôs online and your skill level. That‚Äôs fun.

Here are some of my observations:
1) The spinning wheel always lands on 100 or 250 for the free spin. After hundreds of spins, the wheel would have landed on at least 1 good hit. Don‚Äôt expect realistic probability
2) The ball does NOT always follow the rebound shot indicated on the indicated line. Frequently a ball will not follow the demonstrated rebound line directions
3) with the same applied cue force, the ball will not always follow mechanics with the same cue. Sometimes you will roll forward and pot the cue ball. Sometimes it will stay in place. Sometimes it will roll backward. No consistent mechanics with the same cue and same force shot
4) ‚ÄúSwinging for the fence‚Äù meaning full force cue shots at weird angles against the cushion will nearly always give u a fantastical ball sinking

Then when you got to do a  simple one rail kick with no English to make contact, it will bounce at an angle nowhere near what you aimed at. Giving the opponent ball in hand which usually mean a loss at higher stakes and skill level. Which is where I enjoy playing. 

It seems that the only way to level up is to dump money into the app. Don‚Äôt spend any money and you‚Äôre forced to stay in the lower tiers which don‚Äôt pay out nearly as much XP or points. You will loose many time in a row and run out of coins. 
The easiest games I play and the highest win streaks are always after I put money into the game, but then in a matter of time it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt make a shot to save my life and lose lose lose. 
This game could be great if they would stop with the shady antics. You‚Äôre already getting tons of money from advertising.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-17T15:27:10-07:00

Example- when cue ball is married to the rail on a real- life table, and one is shooting over the rail, the cue ball cannot be hit on the bottom because the rail is blocking it. However in this game, one would have the ability to use draw (bottom- ball hit) on this shot despite it being physically impossible to do so. Object balls that cover parts of the cue ball also have no effect like they would in real pool. It seems like a small detail, but factors like this could mean a win or loss in many situations. I would like to see these limitations enacted to make the game more true to real pool.

The game is borderline criminal. If you learn how to take shots to avoid the scratching algorithm, the game decides to make your aiming wheel jumpy and impossible to get proper aim, or inconspicuously speeds up your time allotment. Apple really should investigate the game for the money they continue to steal from players based on the programming irregularities. I‚Äôve played this game over 2000 times and it‚Äôs quite obvious when the programming changes.

This game is quite fun when it allows you to play other opponents strictly on skill. But when it pairs you against a bot, or sets the algorithm to make you scratch, it‚Äôs quite the joke. I was hesitant to write a review, but after reading many others with the same issue, I have to suggest you spend your money with a different game. I wish there was a ‚Äúsave video replay‚Äù for shots so we could post them for peer review to show how ridiculously rigged the game is.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-04T14:32:40-07:00

Lastly, the prizes on the wheel of misfortune are insulting. I have been playing and spinning for years, and always score the lowest coin prizes on the wheel. It is a waist of my time and a cheap gimmick. If you gave golden spins every day, people would buy more. Just Saying.

This is my second account after rage quitting and deleting my last account when a bot stole a fifty million dollar game from me. Find a way to give players the opportunity to report cheaters and refund them the coins that were stolen.

Making the eight ball on the break for most league play isn't a win anymore, but in almost all leagues, you have to call the eight ball pocket shot. This game rewards more poor shot-making than I have ever seen in over 25 years of playing pool on my table.  Slop shots count by design in 9-ball and 8-ball up to a point.  A player shouldn't be allowed to slop in the 8-ball and still win the game.  I have to agree with other reviews that once you purchase something for REAL MONEY, you are nothing but a target for the bots after that.

Even if they are only one level ahead of you they still have way better odds than you. One example is how I was playing on level 5 against a level 7 we each had one ball left plus the 8 ball. I take my shot hit my ball in the cue ball bounces of the rail and did not go in a hole therefore i should of had another turn but instead the ball goes to the other person (without the option of putting it where they would like ) and continues on to win the game. This has happened almost every time I‚Äôve played. Another reason why this game is rigged is how I was playing level 7 against a level 9 and they had the option of putting the cue ball wherever they wanted no matter if I putted the cue ball or not which ended in them winning the 5000 coins and me losing my 2500 coins without a fair chance to win.

Spend some real money to get a better cue stick or compete in higher bet games and eventually you‚Äôll lose and ads to buy more coins will appear.

9028582825,POKEE3169,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1087637334,5.8.1,4,Overall a pretty well developed game except for this one bug,There is this one bug that I have faced about six times all of which have been in SIGNIFICANTLY large prize games. The bug I‚Äôm talking about is when it‚Äôs your turn and if you make the ball in the game says connection is slow then after the sign disappears it says you ran out of time and then the turn is given to your opponent with ball in hand which doesn‚Äôt make sense cuz I got it in on time but I ‚Äúrun out of time‚Äù PLEASE fix this bug it is quite literally making me lose my games and is just game breaking in a bad way. It basically lets the opponent have ball in hand and it doesn‚Äôt matter if you made it in or not it will still say that the opponent has ball in hand and that you ran out of time,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-28T20:58:13-07:00

My criticism is when having to call a pocket for the eight ball you should be able to eye up your shot in order to pick the best shot before having to choose a pocket. That bugs the crap out of me that you have to choose the pocket first. In 9 ball it is ridiculous to have your shot clock extremely shortened because you are running the table so by the time you get to the 9 ball you have to 2 seconds to shoot! That‚Äôs absurd! Then if you miss the shot because you were so rushed your opponent gets the full shot clock to pick his nose, make a sandwich, then shoot the 9 ball to win. I don‚Äôt mind a shortened clock but 2 seconds is ridiculous!!
There is also some sort of glitch in 8 ball in at least the 100k game where two different times, coincidentally both the 14 ball was made successfully but turned the shot over to the opponent. In both cases I lost the game. Very frustrating!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2017-11-29T09:02:12-07:00

I got the yellow two times in a row now and it says better luck next time or whatever. Now onto the rest..
I like to play this game because it‚Äôs fun, but all the forced ads and in app purchases are so toxic. Like I bet it‚Äôs a free game but they turn it up to 100. I haven‚Äôt felt like I needed to actually buy anything so far, but I swear there is some pay to win because sometimes people are able to move the white ball even tho I didn‚Äôt pocket it. Maybe I‚Äôm just being dumb on that. Though there are like rpg stats on cues so that could be pay to win, at the same time there‚Äôs like a limit or something on how much u can use a cue u unlock or buy which is dumb. 
Overall good game, but beware if you can‚Äôt help yourself with in app purchases or pay2win then avoid it because it‚Äôs a lot.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-23T02:09:39-07:00
