But will punish you if you invest to much time actually trying to improve your stats with back to back games. The developers have an incentive for consumers to keep the app downloaded through its algorithm. Meaning play a few games feel happy come back tomorrow. 

I had the apps downloaded for over 30 days made over 500,000 coins within that time. I won tournaments, became a champion in bronze, brass & silver leagues. I only played a few games here and there in passing. I never meant to play for stats or to even win just to have fun. 

However when decided to chase stats as mine were improving with each game. I would face A.I bots that were levels 110-150. In back to back games. Even though I was only level 20. That never happened when I was just casually playing the game every other day. I would face real players my level & from time to time become friends with those real people. 

The game also gives an advantage to players that were good sports & kind. I tested this theory quite often in fact. If you don’t rush yourself & praise your opponent  for their effort. Then it’s quite easy to get a Hail Mary win even though you should’ve lost. Regardless this is one of the better games I’ve played. Just don’t ever pay to play or pay to win. Don’t become arrogant & attempt to win several back to back games. Eventually you’ll face an opponent the algorithm has chosen to defeat you. Purposefully of course as losing keeps winners wanting to comeback for more.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-25T12:06:06-07:00
