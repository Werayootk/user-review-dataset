I was disappointed, however. The app does not keep pace with your vehicle, the map on your route displays turns as if they are far away, and then you suddenly miss the turn. It’s like the digital depth perception is off. I made more wrong turns using this app than I have with Apple Maps, Waze, or my car’s built in navigation. I will admit that it is convenient to see the location pictures (street view and review pics) and reviews all in the same place. I also like that when other navigation programs do not have the listed address, Google Maps usually does. However, these pros were not helpful enough to outweigh the cons.

Google Maps is very robust but I prefer the way that Waze does navigation. While Google Maps benefits from the Waze data it does not seem that the reverse can be said about Waze. Yet Waze still seems to do navigation better. Google needs to get on with merging Google Maps and Waze into one product and give us the best of both. They’re both 5 star apps but when it comes to navigation Waze is just 0.001 stars better. Google Maps is so much more than navigation which is why I have both downloaded on my phone but Google Maps would be the ultimate maps app if they just merged Waze into it.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-18T22:35:49-07:00

I think the “leave on time” feature can use a little bit of an adjustment. Lately, I’ve been leaving 20 minutes SOONER than mentioned and still arriving 40 minutes late due to unexpected rush-hours. 

***One other feature that would SUPER FREAKING FANTASTIC would be the ability to take the scenic route somewhere. I road-trip a lot and sometimes I’d rather just be able to go check out a byway along the route that’s scenic than be forced to stay on the highway for the “fastest route”. ***

Something else that could be a potential feature would be to avoid high-crime areas. One route the app typically wants to take me down has a strong history for being not the greatest neighborhood (think Amanda Berry release story potential). Fair warning would be super helpful in these parts of town (potentially with a feature to turn it off if someone is okay with it)?

And, indeed Google Maps used to be exactly this. But, over the past 2 years, I have consistently been let down and it seems to be getting worse and worse. It started by being constantly off (by 10 - 20 min) on the ETAs and now it even suggests routs that are longer, more time consuming and overall way less convenient and efficient for no reason at all.

I’ll tell you more, this is probably why that one time I went on this date and my date never showed up. Google maps definitely took me to the wrong 7-eleven! That’s why she blocked me on everything too, probably because she was mad at me for never showing up to our date.

It’s been like this for a decade or more, until you removed it. 

I tried forcing it to go on a freeway by entering its name and city. Example: highway 17 Campbell CA. It now insists that I must exit the freeway, go back an exit, then get off and back on again going my original way. It does this no matter what freeway, city, or direction I’m going, it insists I have to travel between 2 exits 3 times (eg north, then south, then north again).  What idiot thought this was the least bit useful?

This makes it 100% useless for determining how much longer it might take if I want to drive a different route from the single route it suggests. I have good reasons for wanting to take a different route (such as much safer freeway merges with longer merging lanes and better visibility) and I *believe* it will only add 2-3 minutes (on a 1 hour 40 minute trip) to the trip but because you have broken what once worked beautifully, I can no longer get the answer with this app.

The store was a straight shot from where I started and I didn’t even need to get on the highway.

First off, I got lost using google maps in Turkey. The app took me to literally nowhere. I mean the paved road ended and I continued on dirt road. Even that road ended and at that point I decided to switch to Yandex Maps which is superior in that region.

I still continued it in the US. However, in this past trip, I noticed that the app only suggested BP or little known petrol stations on my trip. The best result was suggesting me to add 15 mins to my trip. At the same time, I was passing an exit sign showing me a Shell station a mile away.

The last incident occurred during my trip from NYC to Raleigh. It took me through a stand still traffic of +35 mins. At that point, I was do bored that I downloaded Waze to see if there are alternative routes. As a matter of fact, there was! Waze came up with a 10 min improvement which was quite substantial for my trip. Hence, I am switching to Waze at this point. I hope they’ll fix the app soon.

The issue is the Google maps voice on the app saying the last part of the street name ONLY.

Due to this issue, delivery drivers and visitors have gotten lost and driven on to the other side of town, wasting gas and minutes (up to an hour at times) on the road due to this mishandling. 

I am sure I am not the only one who has submitted this error but still Google maps continues to ignore / dismiss the request possibly deeming it unimportant or irrelevant since no one famous or high profile lives here.  There are decent respectable people who live here and this is not an issue about being nit-picky but about being treated correctly.

I leave reviews and am a “local scout” or whatever  and still use the app due to the fact that Google maps does a few things better than other map apps I have used but I am starting to think about shutting down my Google reviews profile and email account and getting into another emailing, ID, maps system since I and my street name are deemed irrelevant by Google maps.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-10T12:49:36-07:00
