It offers a rich array of features and a user-friendly interface that facilitates dynamic interactions and professional development. 
üí° However, it could significantly benefit from enhanced privacy settings, allowing users to conceal the start dates of their career experiences to combat the prevalent issue of ageism in the professional realm. 

Just like in the education section of a user's profile, this added flexibility would enable individuals to showcase their skills and experiences without the constraint of timelines, promoting a more inclusive professional environment. Overall, LinkedIn stands as a powerful tool for career progression, but adopting more nuanced privacy features would further its commitment to fostering equitable and diverse professional communities.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-26T14:14:20-07:00

Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to utilize this awesome app to its fullest potential again! 

Let me start out by saying that LinkedIn has changed my life in so many positive ways. I found my new career through the app, and started down a journey of positive personal development when I rejoined the platform. Hence the four stars. I needed to take one star away because, at least in the app, it almost always crashes and boots me out when I try to send a Direct Message to someone. I end up needing to go in and retype the message 2-3 times before it will send without crashing and closing out. I know plenty of other people are experiencing the same problem, because they post about it. Please fix this issue, I love this platform for so many reasons, but this is frustrating! Thank you in advance for your attention and all that you do to make LinkedIn the wonderful place that it is! Update: my app has worked perfectly since the last update. No more getting booted out when sending DMs. Thank you LinkedIn!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-31T17:55:07-07:00

When I switched back to LinkedIn, the app opened to the main landing page and when I reopened the message I had been composing a reply to, the text field was empty. I lost an hour of work and I feel so frustrated, distraught, and disheartened. Auto-save for in-progress messages is pretty basic functionality for most messaging programs and if your app had had it, I wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation. I wish I could setup a LinkedIn auto-response that directs everyone who messages through LinkedIn me to contact me on a different interface, so that I could avoid using LinkedIn‚Äôs messaging tool entirely.

The customer representative was like this is a done deal that you are using the 3rd party software and any tickets regarding to this would be closed automatically.

This previously was a great site for people to communicate with other people and companies. Whether it was trying to get a job, improving their position, finding a new workplace due to moving to a new area or trying to move up to a better job, talking with others about how to improve their job skills so they can prepare for a better job or keeping in touch with friends they worked with in the past or, even better, finding old friends and learning how to stay in touch with them. It WAS a great site. 
Now, as the previous commenter said, LinkedIn is now just another Facebook or Twitter. It‚Äôs totally lost all the professionalism it started with. 
If anyone in power within the LinkedIn organization reads this comment, please, please, PLEASE change the format back to what the original people or person had as their vision. If you don‚Äôt, I can foresee this site going down the tubes. I, for one, will do my best to start a new site with only one goal... to make a website for companies and individuals to get together and help each other grow both as a company and as individuals who want to help a company grow and a company willing to help their dedicated individuals grow within the company. 
Also, have learning institutions small and large contribute to the individuals growth.

I even optimized my profile based on suggestions and no discernible difference in engagement or connections. Decided to cancel premium but then found out that I couldn‚Äôt go back to my free profile (perhaps even they know there is no difference!) I had to erase my whole profile just to stop paying for a service that offered no real service! It is annoying because now I can‚Äôt even use LinkedIn links (like when someone send me a job I might be interested in) without making a new free profile.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-10T10:54:10-07:00

My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‚Äòs responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I‚Äôll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon. I would use your out more by not having to manually put in my password, holding the phone to your face makes my motivation to use your application what greater than having to use my large fingers To type in my password. Thank you, John",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-20T08:50:28-07:00

Sometimes I click on a person to message and it just never pulls up the conversation or freezes when I am trying to hit send. Also, when you have a search going, it now disappears the moment you click out of the app to read a text or something which makes you have to keep putting in what you are searching for and it never used to do that.  This app used to be great before they ruined it with pointless updates that only made things worse with no noticeable improvements. I would have rated 5 stars before these updates if that tells you how frustrating this has become.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-25T09:15:31-07:00

Windows 98 is easier to use. You can‚Äôt contact customer support via the phone, at all. If you can‚Äôt log in you can‚Äôt get to their email to contact them and when you finally hear back it‚Äôs ‚Äúviolated terms of service‚Äù and will not elaborate. IV read the TOS and there‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôm doing wrong. Can‚Äôt use the app/website on multiple devices or it will lose its ****. Relies on community mangers to help solve claims but it dosent help at all. I had to google a phone number and email to put in a support ticket while being locked out of my account. The phone goes to an automated voice that only tells you, to refer to their help tab that has useless information. LinkedIn needs competition because this is a huge pain to deal with. I strongly suggest you look for an alternative to LinkedIn.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-20T17:15:18-07:00
