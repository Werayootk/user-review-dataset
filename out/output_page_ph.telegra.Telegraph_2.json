I was intrigued and decided to purchase it for myself, as well as gift it to a friend. However, to my disappointment, the feature does not seem to work for either of us. Although I write in English and my friend writes in Russian, our messages are not automatically translated and we still have to manually translate them. Similarly, when communicating with someone who writes in Ukrainian, my English messages to them are translated, but their messages to me are not. \n\nI only use the desktop version of Telegram when I need to save photos to my computer, and I have noticed that the desktop and web versions do translate messages properly.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that support for Telegram is lacking, as it is supposedly provided by volunteers and I have not received any response to my requests for assistance. While I understand that volunteers may not be able to respond promptly, it would be beneficial if Telegram could improve their customer support.\n\nOverall, I hope that Telegram takes note of my review and works on fixing the issue with the automatic message translation feature.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-13T10:28:05-07:00"},{"id":"3435935532","userName":"vedsd","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id635744527","version":"5.0.17","score":4,"title":"Nothing Competes","text":"This is my go-to messaging service.

It does everything we need and I’d never consider switching. However!\n\nI’ve recently gotten a 7th gen iPad with the keyboard case attachment, and for some reason, using the keyboard in Telegram is disastrous. Words will delete themselves and the text cursor will back up as if another force is trying to move it, meaning my messages are full of missing words and typed over mistakes. It’s frustrating, but not constant; it comes and goes. Unfortunately, it happens a little to much for my tastes. \n\nI’ll continue to use telegram, absolutely, just maybe less on this device in particular.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-03-01T09:01:24-07:00"},{"id":"6326605139","userName":"OliverTwist78","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id43822912","version":"7.0","score":5,"title":"Yah!

Not to mention lot of security issues that kept coming up a lot of times.\n\nI tested Telegram for a while and was convinced it is better app than WhatsApp. I persuaded my friends to try Telegram app, and many of them switched to Telegram while reducing the use of WhatsApp.\n\nWhat makes Telegram shine? It has native apps for all of products running macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS with consistent interface. I like the animated stickers much more than emojis. So do my friends, too.\n\nOther thing is that Telegram is independent (so far) and not under control of Fakebook or other corporations with vested interests.\n\nThe only downside is watchOS app that seems to take a while to load up the chats when launching.
