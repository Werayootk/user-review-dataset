Also the comments section is trash. If there is a comment they don‚Äôt want others to see they will hide it under the banner of ‚Äúrelevancy‚Äù. It stifles conversation and turns every comment section into an echo chamber of self-righteous drivel.

2. If I delete someone don‚Äôt put them back in the suggested contacts over and over and over and over. They should not ever appear again.

3. Don‚Äôt delete my review because you don‚Äôt like it.
