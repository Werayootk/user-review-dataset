For example: 
So-and-so is live. 

Or 2 of your connections interacted with a post. 

I constantly turn these off but I seem to have a new one everyday. The live notifications might be by person (which is crazy to think about turning them all off). If that’s not the case they’re simply changing the wording on the notifications slightly (which is deceptive).

Also the comments section is trash. If there is a comment they don’t want others to see they will hide it under the banner of “relevancy”. It stifles conversation and turns every comment section into an echo chamber of self-righteous drivel.

There is lagging when scrolling or pressing buttons. There are too many different menu options. The advertisements are extremely blatant rather than flowing naturally in the home feed.

But Apple advise that only two months can be refunded even though LInkedIn apparently began charging me monthly in December 2019.

Again my issue is a simple one. 

1. Make the “X” to click off a potential contact a bit larger so I am not opening one instead of deleting it. 

2. If I delete someone don’t put them back in the suggested contacts over and over and over and over. They should not ever appear again. 

Two simple fixes to two problems with linked in. 

Additional problem that was not in my first two reviews: 

3. Don’t delete my review because you don’t like it.

3/9/19 Update:
Keeps getting worse. Nothing has been fixed and the little “x” seems harder to click. I don’t want to click on the “x” just to have it open someone’s profile. It is a false click. I am sure that is why I get so many “people are looking at your profile” notifications each week, the tiny “x”

I will add another problem:
4. Half the time now I cannot open a profile I actually want to see. The program freezes and I need to close and reopen the app, then I need to TRY to find that persons again.
