Better yet I’m still thinking of new prompts for it to make. The amazing tales of Walter, Willow, Wendy, Gideon, and Oliver the worms. Stories from love to betrayal in a garden.🪱\n\nHaha anyways, great app. Quick to explain problems varying off of any topic and explain any information you may need to know.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-24T22:46:15-07:00"},{"id":"9969608608","userName":"Zubair_Khalid","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1076688164","version":"1.2023.23","score":4,"title":"Fast!

It's quick and accurate.\n\nCons:\nOne limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-26T23:09:12-07:00"},{"id":"9969578521","userName":"jeffm23","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28807036","version":"1.2023.23","score":4,"title":"Needs iPad version","text":"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen.

So for example if there was a heated debate ChatGPT would lean in one direction rather that opposing view. \nSome responses have me concerned because at the end of the day due to the biases of the people entering the data may not be 100% factual or some important data may be suppressed.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2024-01-08T11:04:53-07:00"},{"id":"10452736891","userName":"Authentic314","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id358548328","version":"1.2023.264","score":5,"title":"Just what you need, if you understand why!","text":"I have had the pleasure of utilizing the services of ChatGPT, and I must say that it is nothing short of incredible. First and foremost, ChatGPT’s natural language processing abilities are truly remarkable. It comprehends and responds to text inputs with astounding accuracy, making it an invaluable resource for tasks such as research, writing, and communication.

Since the app does not have the ability to upgrade itself, it is locked into 2021 and earlier data. In this age of fast moving technology and information retrieval that’s too bad. It doesn’t even have the ability to access the internet.
