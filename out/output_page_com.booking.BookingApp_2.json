ODD. So we went and got them fixed thinking maybe our phones disconnected the key cards, we walk into our room to find a housekeepers cleaning stuff on our sink. NOW, they do NOT offer housekeeping unless you ask for it, they also didn‚Äôt clean anything!! Just set there stuff on the sink... when we asked why someone went in our room we got a shoulder lift like they can‚Äôt do anything about it, then picks up her cell phone to bluntly and repeatedly telling me I don‚Äôt know and seems very uninterested on clearing up why someone went in there‚Ä¶ So far, nothing was taken from us, but we just wanted to know why they went in our room and couldn‚Äôt even get a answer. So if you leave don‚Äôt leave your $$$ stuff. I had a lot of nice things I didn‚Äôt want to leave in my car in there.

The vibe is FRIENDLY, WELCOMING AND HOSPITABLE. I was in Jordan for about 3 days and wanted to see Petra. Firas put together a tour for me to get the most out of my time in Jordan and it was amazing. I got to visit Wadi Rum, Petra, Aqaba and the Dead Sea. I got to see more way more tourist sites than I could have originally planned, and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy. The bathrooms, showers and bedrooms are clean and well divided. The outdoor space is very comfortable and with an amazing view to the city in the front. The overall the ambience is very relaxed, calm and comfortable; therefore very fitting for either younger or older people. \n\nThe owners of the hostel are Ahmad and Firas. If you get to meet either of them you will feel like you have known them for years just by chatting with them for a few minutes very welcoming. \n\nI‚Äôll come back to visit real soon and I would of course book with Carob Hostel. I would recommend this location to my friends and family. If you are coming to Jordan make sure you stay here and book tours with them you will not regret it. (Tips book the JordanPass and you will save a lot since the visa is included in the pass).

Enjoyed the view of the ocean the pool the beach. Davian was our pool area guy and he knew his stuff made sure we kept up with the lunch time and went to get what we wanted in time so we had no wait and fed us nonstop drinks. He even knew the things my little niece liked and would pre-order for her. He really went above and beyond and I really like that! Wide selection of breakfast although some of the servers were stingy hey I love my food and one of them wasn‚Äôt very pleasant with my brother so I would have to go back there to get his plate. However food was really well cooked and flavorful. Enjoyed a few night shows and dinning, really loved the Italian restaurant.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-28T21:10:48-07:00"},{"id":"7483435959","userName":"Robert G3","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id801360955","version":"28.8","score":1,"title":"Don‚Äôt use Booking","text":"Don‚Äôt use booking. They are middle men who only collect fees and don‚Äôt help with anything else. If you can‚Äôt reach the property booking won‚Äôt help. If the property won‚Äôt call or email you back, booking still won‚Äôt help. Waiting on a refund booking won‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve contacted the property multiple times and I get no response from them. Also don‚Äôt book or stay at Downtown 24 Concierge. I‚Äôve been contacting them for over a week and they don‚Äôt respond to messages and never return phone calls. Like I said, booking won‚Äôt help. Use at your own risk.\n\nUpdate to the developer response. I‚Äôve already contacted customer service and was lied to by Javey if that‚Äôs even his real name. I still haven‚Äôt heard back from you all or the property. I‚Äôm still out of $293 that I‚Äôm being scammed out of by you and the aforementioned property. It‚Äôs been 16 days since I cancelled my reservation and I still haven‚Äôt received my refund. So try again with your nonsense. If you can‚Äôt get me my refund to respond to these reviews.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-19T13:09:43-07:00"},{"id":"7196822401","userName":"dwazmin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1078266280","version":"27.9","score":1,"title":"Bad service and charges for cancellation that weren‚Äôt even booked within 24 hours","text":"First off me and my husband were told that we could use the military discount on the app but when it came to it nothing showed up to put in the military discount information so they lied about that and we were left with an over bearing price that was more than the original price the hotel website even offered then when we tried to cancel the reservation we assumed we wouldn‚Äôt be charged because it was barely even 10 minutes after booking even though they have a 24 hour policy on bookings, which we tried to get the charges waived there was difficulty to get into contact with the customer service manager because there needed to be a ‚Äúthird party‚Äù to speak to us on the app but they were saying that there was nothing that they could which already goes against their policy. So we ended up having to keep the reservation since we‚Äôre tight on budgets, terrible service and terrible app, don‚Äôt recommend if you‚Äôre on a budget!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-07T21:21:38-07:00"}]
