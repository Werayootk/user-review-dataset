Por ejemplo, si cancelas tu reserva un día antes no te devuelven todo el dinero. Es entendible si hiciste la reserva semanas antes y le impediste al anfitrion tener la casa disponible para otros huespedes.
Pero a veces uno no tiene tiempo de andar planificando viajes con tanta anticipación, por ejemplo yo suelo buscar airbnb de un día para otro. Hace poco reservé un airbnb para el dia siguiente, instantaneamente me surgió una urgencia que me obligó a cambiar mis planes y en menos de 15 minutos cancelé la reserva. Como el sistema considera que estoy cancelando un dia antes del inicio de la estadia entonces elige no devolverme todo el dinero. Realmente tengo que perder 200usd por haber evitado que el anfitrión ofrezca esa vivienda durante 15 minutos?? A mi me parece injusto. Entiendo si me cobra una pequeña multa o un pequeño porcentaje. Pero básicamente le regalé 200usd a un anfitrion en 15 minutos. Acto seguido me prometi nunca mas volver a usar esta app.

El otro problema es que no sirve para planificar tu viaje porque nunca te muestra el precio final. Al principio parece que rinde economicamente pero luego agrega su comision y el servicio de limpieza y termina siendo mas caro que un hotel 3 estrellas, por lo que el 95% de las veces no conviene.

Recuerdo hace muchos años la app rendía porque era beneficiosa para anfitriones y huespedes. Mientras uno ganaba algo de dinero alquilando temporalmente su casa, el otro podia viajar un poco mas barato. Hoy los precios se han disparado a un nivel que ya no tiene sentido, afectando no solo al viajero sino tambien al vecino que vive en la ciudad y le aumenta constantemente el valor de alquileres de largo plazo al mismo tiempo que se reduce notablemente la oferta. Por este motivo encuentro totalmente lógico que las grandes ciudades estén comenzando a prohibirla.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-08T13:42:19-07:00

I am disgusted that a company I started to like and use more often chooses to be complicit in illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Palestinians get kicked out of their home and have their homes stolen and then listed on Airbnb. And they choose to continue listing these properties even after announcing they’ll remove them from the platform.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T00:29:46-07:00

When we showed up to our airbnb it felt like a scam (dirty house, personal belongings everywhere, valuables left out) and we left immediately.  After reporting this to airbnb we were left on read for weeks and never received a full refund.  Even after we were able to get the host to refund us a little more money airbnb refused to release it to us.  Airbnb does not care about your experience after you’ve booked with them and trying to get a refund for any reason is a nightmare.
