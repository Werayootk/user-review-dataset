They give amazing deals and even better clothes for the price. Love the prices. I always receive my order within 2 weeks normally so shipping is super fast and always free on Sundays.

I’ve only had one problem with a order and they helped me quickly resolve the problem customer service is amazing.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-07T15:15:53-07:00

11016405570,I love the ocean!!!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id317405531,10.5.5,5,Amazing app! Just one thing…,"I absolutely love SHEIN! It has so many great clothing picks, and amazing fashion! The jewelry is top notch and there is so much of it!  This is probably my favorite place to find clothes! Other than Old Navy…. It has so many choices along with cheap affordable prices! My mom got me so many cute sweaters and sweatshirts off it for Christmas. I love that the shirts have cute sayings like “ Back off! I have a big sister and I am not afraid to use her!” Or “ Be Kind!” The earrings are adorable and there are some for all girl ages. The dresses are a great length. They’re not to short, if you are worried about that…. You can find almost anything that has a cute logo on it! I haven’t looked at the shoes yet, but I bet they are great! The only thing is that there are crop tops in almost every set of clothes! Even in the 6-7 year old catagory! What is up with that! Even the dresses! I still think the app is great, but think that they need to change that one little problem. Overall I still love SHEIN!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-06T17:13:50-07:00
