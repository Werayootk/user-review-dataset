What a pleasant surprise when I got exactly what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time! No, the clothes aren‚Äôt superior quality, but what do you expect when you pay $6 for a shirt? They reward customers to post pictures of the clothes once they receive them, so you get an idea of what the clothes will look like on REAL women, not just models. Really can‚Äôt say enough good things about SHEIN.

Update: I‚Äôve now had an experience with the return process with SHEIN, so wanted to give an update to my review since that was something I was worried about.  Returning something is super easy! They give you a free shipping label, you drop it back into the mail, and you‚Äôre done.

‚Ä¢LONG REVIEW‚Ä¢

I have ordered clothing from shein three times and I have to say that the first time buying clothes was a bit unsatisfying. Most of it was me trying my best to find the right sizes. I would recommend looking at reviews and photos from others who have bought before to have a better decision on 
a best size choice. It helps A LOT!! (Especially if you are a small or xtra small fit) Items I bought such as bras and bra-tops were mediocre in material and fabrics but most shirts and crop tops I have purchased were awesome. Basically some clothing is cheaper than others in fabric. Self measurements can be a bit inaccurate with clothing at times maybe because of how the clothes are designed but just go with your gut if wanting to continue shopping. HIGHLY RECOMMEND BEING CAREFUL WHEN LOOKING FOR JEANS OR SHOES!! 

Prices are very low which is awesome for me since I‚Äôm a college student trying to buy inexpensive clothing. The most expensive things I‚Äôve ever encountered on there are the shipping fees (FAST SHIPPING IS LIKE $12 MORE) and shoe prices. 

Overall, I would go with shein being great. And also, if you are into aesthetic trends and fashion like me. Shein provides inexpensive trendy clothing! I think it‚Äôs a good experience for young ladies to try shein and see if it‚Äôs the best shopping place. I personally like it and will continue to shop on there! :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-16T15:14:50-07:00

And I love looking in the petite section and I‚Äôm so sad that some of the clothes don‚Äôt come im larger sizes ( I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 2XL) because I absolutely love some of the clothes that are in that section. My friends who got me into SHEIN are small, like really small, like, my friend had to put extra holes in her belt to make it fit her, kind of small. All of the clothes on SHEIN are beautiful, even when I look at the stuff I can‚Äôt wear, like petite clothes that don‚Äôt have any larger sizes, I still say, ‚ÄúOh my god that‚Äôs adorable!‚Äù I just wish that the size range was better, and I wish the belts where a better quality because I bought a few belts and they broke and the belt hole cover things to make it look nice, those fell off in two days of wearing it, and the belts started to rip after a week or so. 
Thanks for reading my ramble I hope the feedback helps you all!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-14T10:58:23-07:00

That is as long you don‚Äôt abuse it, which many people have done sadly. 

I do have one suggestion and that is to have a option to control what notifications you receive. I get a lot of notifications from shein throughout the day, a lot of which I don‚Äôt really care for.

I‚Äôm pretty sure they misplaced the package and they do not want to admit it. They aren‚Äôt sending me another package to fix the problem, and they also are extremely hard to get ahold of so to ask for my money back is almost nearly impossible. They don‚Äôt have an actual customer service, you talk to a computer instead of real people. So your answers don‚Äôt actually get answered. So I probably will never receive my items, nor will I get my money back.

I was still unsure when I placed my first order since I don‚Äôt know this app/brand/company. I decide to give a try because I really like the price and style they presented. 

I was impressed when I received my first order. Some of the clothes are thinner than I expected but not too bad. Some of the dresses are in really nice material and all of the clothes I bought are comfortable. Size fit in just right. One of the dress was too small because I accidentally chose the wrong size. Return is very easy and hassle free. 

I already placed three orders in two months. Love their sites:
1. Their clothes are very stylish and cheap
2. The return is easy and hassle free
3. The size fits right
4. Lot of products to choose

The buyer need to keep in mind is that you need to have reasonable expectation. You can‚Äôt expect to pay $10-$20 and receive $50-$100 products. I think their price is cheap compare to the Walmart, Ross etc. SHEIN is way better than them with cheaper price.

If I knew prices increased due to improvement of SHEIN‚Äôs working conditions, then I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying more for their products.  But, if SHEIN has merely increased their prices just to pad their bottom line because they are a multi- billion dollar entity, that just seems greedy to me.

Like ugh why can‚Äôt you have the same clothes just make bigger sizes we wanna look fine too. Idk plus size women always gets the short end of the stick. Please take into consideration what I‚Äôm saying I wanna open they app and see someone my size with cute clothing on. It‚Äôs hard to find that with a good price !!!!!!!! #bodypositivity,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-22T08:22:01-07:00

It has gotten much worse since then. The last order I placed before this current one was in mid-2020 and it had no major issues. However, I guess shein has switched their warehousessince then?? To a much worse one apparently. I spent about $70 my first time being back on shein around march15th. I was contuously waiting for my package. The tracking number said it would delivered march 25-27. When that time had passed I contacted customer service on shein and they said it would be delivered April 3rd. Then April 3rd passed. As soon as I realized they were lying to me I demanded a refund which they gave me. Nonetheless, my package never came. It is now April 5th. My package tracking has still not updated since the 19th of March. Unfortunately I will never be shopping here again because although the process are what I can afford right now, I'm not going to risk another situation like this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-05T17:26:38-07:00

There‚Äôs a Mix between Female and male clothes, they sale kid and pet clothes, they have house decorations, makeup, and more. The best thing about all of this is that it‚Äôs Cheep yet really good quality. All the clothes are up to date in fashion, and they have lots of options and styles you can look at and purchase. They also give you coupons, and points for buying stuff and rating the clothes you buy, which is used to lower your price on your item/items when your checking out.
It‚Äôs very trustworthy, and your sure to get what you ordered in 2 weeks or earlier, but if you can you can always get express shipping which adds a little more to the price.

All being said I rate this clothes store 11/10 and would 100% recommend.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-29T06:40:15-07:00

But thats not the issue I‚Äôm here to address. The app allows you to rate items you receive for pulpits to purchase more items. But unless you give them a 5 star review, your review gets hidden and no one ‚Äúlikes‚Äù your review no matter how thorough, and accurate your review is. I‚Äôve left them 3 Star reviews with LOTS of photos and details and sizes and everything and NO ONE has seen my reviews. I have to do a DEEP DIVE to find my review. Meanwhile, you have people with 5 star reviews that has NO PHOTO and very little details and they made it to the top. So they‚Äôre racking up points to buy more close for being dishonest while my honest reviews are getting buried. I could just play their game and give good reviews so I can have points to buy more clothes but I really don‚Äôt feel like folding and playing along with the game. DO BETTER.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-13T19:36:33-07:00
