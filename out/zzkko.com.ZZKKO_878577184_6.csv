10964271213,babybird9990,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1389266956,10.4.2,3,I like it but some of it is just….,"I love SHEIN! It’s great! It’s cheap and affordable and everything is legit. People say they have a lot of knock off products and they do, but they’re affordable! I’m not giving them a three star review because of any of their clothes because I love their clothes. The real issue is the maturity age you must have for some of the products. I shop a lot and I love to buy stuff and explore new shopping apps. 
I downloaded SHEIN maybe a year or two ago and bought some products and fell in love. Recently, I was with my family and friends when I decided I’ll scroll to see if I want to buy anything and some very questionable clothes came up. There was either profanity on the clothing or the clothes made you look naked. I then decided I wanted to browse some more and I looked past the weird clothes. I was scrolling in the categories and accidentally clicked on the wrong thing. A notification popped up saying,""Are you over or under eighteen?"" And you had to click if yes or no. I clicked yes to see what I had come across and when the screen popped up and the notification went away, I immediately clicked out of the app entirely and came here to write a review. I understand you can find anything on the internet nowadays, and more and more kids are getting phones and shouldn’t be shown sexual items like they have on SHEIN. I understand it’s the parents responsibility to watch their kids and stores can put on whatever they want on their website. The thing is when you come on the App Store and go to SHEIN, it says ages 11+. An 11 year old should not be seeing stuff like that. I also fully understand there are bad things on Amazon and other shopping sites, but I know many kids who are under the age of 13 who have SHEIN and you can easily lie about the age. When it asks you are you 18+, you can just click yes. 
I hope you understand what I was trying to voice and I hope you take it into consideration.
Have a great day!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-21T10:01:09-07:00
