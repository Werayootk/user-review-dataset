Please stay away!!! What is the purpose of paying for fees when you receive mediocre customer service. No one that deal with real time issue and everyone pass the blame on everyone. 

Now this is my last straw with this company and I know I am the fool with this one. But I will be closing this account asap. Recently I order some grocery on a platform.

The only reason I know of it is because of sweat coin. I went through the hoops to try to get free sweat coin premium, the app even told me it was still a thing. Come to find out, nope it was just a sneaky scam to try to get me to pay for another account. Absolutely bonkers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-04T11:31:38-07:00

9882874878,Abonak2,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1345545231,9.4,1,Holding your money hostage in the name of security,"Not even close to the worst banking app in the state. My in-law in Australia asked me to open an account so she can send me the money she owes me. After receiving the money I transferred $1000 to my bank account a few days ago. I was trying to send the rest today and it got declined. As you may have noticed, there is no number you can call to talk to a live agent and live chat takes FOREVER till someone gets back to you with a scripted response and when you ask a question then s/he ghosts you. 
Long story short, after 8 hours they sent me a text saying there is a scam going on and we need you to write some information ( provided by them) on a piece of paper and take a selfie with it (my face in the picture) to verify who i am. It reminds me those hostage movies that they take a photo with the today newspaper to show they are alive. 
Anyhow, it is sad they don’t know the basic of business and customer services. That’s how businesses get screwed and not take off. 
I won’t comply with such a stupid request and already provided all information that tells who I am.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-01T16:59:11-07:00
