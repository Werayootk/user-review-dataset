Uber informed me that the ride was 2 minutes away, but after waiting 10 minutes, the app had only gone up 6 minutes to a total of 8 minutes away. This compelled me to contact the driver, who was extraordinarily rude. This uber was extraordinarily unprofessional, had more than one of her own friends in the car, and talked to me in a condescending way when asking if she was alright and would prefer for me to find another ride. She then continued to drive away and lengthen the time of pickup after responding to me “we good you’ll be straight” after asking if she was okay and whether she’d prefer me to calm another ride. Because of the unfriendly system of the uber app, I was never able to contact the company in order to report the driver, while it was a major annoyance for me, it wasn’t the end of the world. But I want to report this driver for being unprofessional and Uber does not give the opportunity to do that, the app does not support the customers or even try to.

She sat in her car facing me so that I could not see the license plate. She didn’t call or text me. I eventually figured out she was my Uber and got in the car. It smelled like fish. When I tried to use the seat belt I couldn’t find the buckle as it was tucked away down between the seat and the door rather than at the top of the belt where it usually is. After what happened next I have to presume that a prior rider had given up trying to use the belt and just left it alone without putting it back in proper position. After I had finally found the buckle, it wouldn’t fit in the lock. Thalis asked me to move to the other side of the seat behind her. I did so and found the buckle right away, but still had some difficulty getting it in the lock. There was no apology. Now I find that she charged me $1.08 for “wait time”. This charge is ridiculous as I was outside and she didn’t identify herself or ask my name. I was the only person there.

They will hire anybody to drive, I have often been the victim of scams by Uber drivers. They claim to have arrived, they never arrive and then they claim a cancellation fee. I had also had a driver try to get paid for a ride she never arrived for by claiming I wasn’t wearing a mask. I was wearing a mask and she never even arrived. Took me several messages to get my money back. 

The other issue is their so called ‘variable pricing’. Everybody is up in arms here in MIami as they hike their pricing through the roof every time they feel demand is going to be higher (during events or the busy season). So for a ride that’s usually $5-7, they will ask upwards of $50!!!! I have repeatedly talked to Uber drivers about this and they have disclosed that over 90% of the inflated price goes to Uber and very little to the driver. So essentially they are taking advantage of both customers as well as their employees. 

I have now installed Lyft and I made that my go to app. Uber should be shut down, they are abusing their market power and behaving like a monopoly.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-03T12:36:38-07:00

Not only is the app wildly overpriced for the distance you are traveling, but because of the way cancellations favor the driver you can’t reliably plan your trip at all. I have been late or have completely missed opportunities or appointments because drivers will cancel the ride if they don’t like the direction you are going. This is completely unacceptable in my opinion. The way I see it, you are providing a service and this is what you sign up to do. I as a customer have to pay a premium to get anywhere and I find it so frustrating that I can’t rely on a driver to actually pick me up. Several times I have waited over 20 minutes just for a driver to cancel on me. It makes the app unusable. There should at the very least be a maximum number of times a driver can cancel rides per hour or something to mitigate this. It’s so frustrating and I don’t even want to continue to spend my money on this anymore. At this point, I can’t even get a driver most times unless I wait 15 minutes for someone to accept the ride. It is beyond frustrating and I am at the point of deleting the app entirely.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-07T08:42:37-07:00

I do like the share your ride feature. I do however wish you could see maybe traits on your driver like if their smokers or have any tickets or are safe drivers etc. I also believe Uber could benefit from a request box or options for when you book a ride. For example you could offer a quiet ride for those who have social anxiety and prefer to not converse, as well as a low sensory feature for those individuals who suffer from sensory overload and other similar triggers. This would make your service more accessible to all rather than few. Another great addition would be love agent texting through the app if the passenger(s) feel unsafe at anytime. That way they could walk you through the proper steps and alert the proper authorities if needed for you. Again Uber overall is a convenient and easy to use app but when it comes to reliable and safe ride service for all it has some room for growth.

Minor issue but it becomes tedious when reserving 5-10 rides at a time every week. I hope that the Uber app developers fix this bug soon as it has been like this for a few months now.

Bug 2: Today my driver was early for my scheduled ride. Therefore, I was under the impression that I could perhaps leave work early and get to my destination a little faster. However, instead I sat in the car with my driver for more than 5 minutes before we left the pickup spot because the app does not let the driver begin the ride more than 10 minutes before the scheduled pickup time. I do scheduled rides 6-10 times a week and many drivers have shared all sorts of problems they are having with the scheduled ride service.

It keeps getting more and more expensive making it harder to reach destinations. If you wanna go 10 min down the road it is $20-$34. The app says it’s cuz they are busy so fares are higher but it makes it extremely difficult for me the rider to get to places as I don’t have that money to pay every single day so I can get to work. I used to pay $8-$12 sometimes $15 just to go from my house to work and now I can’t even afford to go to work. It isn’t that helpful. While I understand the drivers need to get paid, the more expensive you create ur prices the more you will lose customers because nobody can afford to pay that much 5 days out of a week just to go to a job to support themselves. I literally sit on the app for 3 hours hoping the prices will decrease and change but they don’t they just get higher and higher every time I open the app. I can’t keep riding with a company that wants to charge me $30 every time I need to go 10 min down the street for a job to create a living. It is not affordable and is stressful when you can’t get a ride when you absolutely need one. When Uber first came out I liked it, now everything is extremely expensive and it takes forever just to get a ride.

I always have to argue through emails with Uber because it seems like none of their reps know what they are looking at or understanding half the time. It’s such a pain to deal with.

Then the times where the app wasn’t working at all. Period. Oh, don’t let me forget about the drivers I’ve gotten as well. Made me question as to whether Uber will take just anyone as a driver.

I made the mistake of checking the box accepting responsibility for my items if they get stolen. Unfortunately Uber seems to be a master of deception and defends their employees. As long as the car was at the location of the gps they say it’s not their responsibility. The driver left my items at the wrong apartment. Didn’t even leave it at the same apartment complex. She delivered it at the townhomes on the other side of the highway. My brother spent over an hour on his bicycle locating my items. With nothing to go on but a picture taken of the floor mat. Couldn’t have At least gotten a shot of the unit number. Because they knew it was the wrong location and that Uber wouldn’t hold them accountable they just abruptly cut off communication with me because they knew they did wrong.  Mind you I stayed in communication with the Uber driver the entire time and clearly stated my correct building number and unit number. 
Oh but Uber can just say they were at the location. Close but across the highway? Seriously. Yea they were close but definitely the wrong location.

Some parents send their children in Uber/lyfts because they do not have transportation. By changing the age limit to ride in a Uber causes kids to NOT have any transportation and to not be safe outside in the cold without a ride/walking in the dark. You are also putting their lives in danger because the ride was already ordered and they have no way to get home. Uber DOES show the location on where you are at anytime. Uber DOES show how to share your location as WELL AS A SAFETY MODE. Uber does all these things for adults why can’t they do it for children(teenagers) too? They are still making more money AND WHEN YOU REFUSE THE RIDE YOU CHARGE $5.00. If you are going to charge $5 as a cancellation fee you might as well just allow them to ride. It’s also wasting time when the Uber driver IS ALREADY THERE then refuses the ride due to being a minor. I don’t think children should be allowed to make an account but be able to get in a ride to get home. I’m not saying “don’t take Uber” but I feel that some of their rules are unfair. “We will Uber to your place. Be right there.” Yeah you’re right there but you’re refusing me a ride home. I don’t think anyone under 10 should be getting in the car with a stranger but TEENAGERS. From 13 to beyond should be allowed to ride in Ubers.

It provides a great and reliable service. 

Lately, however, not only have prices been going up at a ridiculous and unsustainable rate, the framework for drivers being assigned rides has worsened. I talked with a driver recently and learned that instead of Uber assigning the closest driver for your ride, they allow drivers to snag up any ride on a first come first serve basis, regardless of their distance from the rider. This has resulted in ridiculous wait times for rides, to the point that I’m waiting 25 minutes for my driver to arrive for a 10 minute drive. Uber allowed me to cancel my ride in lieu of requesting a new driver once, but that was the only grace. Now, I am forced to wait ridiculous wait times for short drives unless I want to pay a fee for cancelling the ride and looking for a new driver. 

I’ve had to rely on Uber lately because I’ve had car issues. With the prices increasing and the wait times worsening, I’ve finally branched out and found other ride share and taxi services as an alternative to this app. I will continue to do so, and encourage others to do the same, until Uber addresses these issues and provides a resolution.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-23T12:20:42-07:00

Horrible Customer Service,"Every time I have used uber, I’ve learned that the “estimated” pickup and arrival times have been falsified for appeal. For example, my uber was supposed to come in 9 minutes, it arrived in 22 minutes. Therefore, we were late arriving to our destination over 30 minutes. There wasn’t much traffic at fault. Our driver was choosing and switching music on his iPad while he was driving. This ride cost over $23 for myself only. There were 6 other people in the car. The driver had the audacity to ask for a 5 star rating. Once I told him he did not earn a 5 star rating, he low-balled me! Now my overall uber rating is a 4.8! However, 4.8 and still can’t get customer service. I did email with Karen and Sara, so you know who to avoid in customer service.

Contacted uber support, as always, they did not do anything to solve the issue or follow their own standards and give me a refund. If the arrival time is over 5 minutes of the estimated time, their policy is to issue you a refund. They never do. 

I have heard rumors that people receive their refunds quickly, or get great customer service, but those rumors are false.

To start, my Ubers have picked up the wrong person twice. A week ago my Uber picked up the wrong person, let them change the location of their drop off, and then charged me for the extended trip.

I got charged a cancellation fee, because I canceled mid trip. I tried calling the driver multiple times to no success, and was forced to contact Uber AGAIN. 

While Uber’s costumer service has been satisfying in the way that I have gotten my money back, the amount of time I have wasted these past few weeks has been irritating to say the least. I have spent at least an hour waiting for Ubers that weren’t coming, and trying time and time again to call another Uber. I have been late to several events because of this, and have been forced to use Uber x instead of Uber pool because my pools have canceled on me or taken the wrong person.

That is a huge difference for a wait time. If I had cancel the trip because my driver was taking longer than I would have been charge a fee. How is that fair? On top of this, I had to change my destination so a re-arrange the new address but, the driver took twice the time which charged me an exaggerated amount for a faster drive. Why does it happens like this if besides taking long for it to arrive for pick-up and longer time for the trip I get charged more!! That is no help at all!! Not convenient at all!!! Uber has to be more conscious on the availability of cancellation of a trip if driver is taking longer!!!!! 
So, as well as there are benefits from using Uber there are some inconveniences. The most outstanding one I will say that is the estimated arrival for a pick-up. The app should not allow drivers to pick-up a trip of more than 5 minutes or even just 5 because it usually takes at least that or more. That is a waste of time as a customer since one of the main reasons we might be using this service is because we are in a rush, so we don’t have that time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-11-28T13:59:41-07:00

Like i said, build in a way to increase font size or have the app make use of the iPhone already-existing large font features.  Another idea is to not assume “accessibility” only means people on wheelchairs or who use guide dogs.  How much would it help customers  AND drivers if “rider is low-vision” or “rider is deaf”could be voluntarily added to the profile?   Understand that very few “blind” people are completely blind just as very few deaf people are 100% deaf, so many of us prefer to use tech as naturally and inconspicuously as possible.  

Thing is, it is not just a low -vision problem.   When i complained to my spouse and a couple of friends —alll of whom have eyesight in the normal range, they all said they found this app’s font hard to read.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-21T12:41:50-07:00

If taking an Uber lets me stay in bed til the last possible moment, I take one. That being said, I’m on first name basis with nearly all the drivers in my area. However, there are some bad apples out there. My main dislike is when drivers don’t end the trip. I work at an airport, and I’ve had drivers take me home and go all the way back without ending the ride until they get there. This results in a ~$25 trip costing $50+. Of course, this makes me have to go open a help ticket with support. (They made this harder to do it seems). Another trick of some drivers is to get close enough to start the ride, then if they don’t like it, they’ll either cancel it, or drive away somewhere far enough where I’ll have to cancel it. On my dollar. What’s more, if the support team see you have a ‘pattern’ of requesting a refund, they can deny you one. Even if it’s clear it’s an error on part of the driver. 
I feel like the driver’s app should have a fail safe built in. If they make it to the drop off location, and leave farther than a certain distance, the trip should automatically end. God forbid I’m busy when I make it home or to work and can’t check if the driver still has the trip up.

They did things to my account that I had never asked like refunding the money I put on my account. I’ve had holds placed on my card that their refunds don’t process quickly. Each time I asked for customer support a new person would contact me back with repeated information that had nothing to do with my issues. I purchased a gift card  while being abroad in the country I’m using the app in & I go to enter the gift card and it says it can’t be used in this country. I’ve never struggled so much with Uber and it’s the main form of transportation where I am currently at... so you can sense how important it is & I was never taken serious by customer support. They tried to deny me a refund of the gift card I purchased until I went a different route with gift card support. It’s all so frustrating. I’m still having issues & it almost seems that I’ve been locked out of using any sort of financial on my account.

I give them credit though bc when I write them they get back immediately and they at least try to rectify the issue. With a small credit or something. What I dislike is that a driver will accept ur ride but then take 5-10 mins to leave their house. Other times they are on the road and arrive in a timely manner. I had one driver refuse to let me stop at a fast food restaurant. I had another that missed the turn and ended up costing me an extra $7 for a trip I take frequently. And actually the day that happened I sent my friend a text sharing my location because we were lost, he ended the trip, and I had no clue where we were. I feared the worse. Anyway that’s my rant. I still ❤️ Uber and will continue to use them. The great thing is that if you rate a driver poorly, Uber won’t match u with them again. The bad part is, u have to add all stops BEFORE ur trip.

I asked him if he had the address 555 NW 62nd St and he said he did.  I then said that it was a Sheraton Hotel and was not far away.  He said ok.  After a few minutes we asked again although his English was pretty much non existent he said yes 555.  Shortly we found out we were on our way to Miami.  He then let us out at Wendy’s way south of Fort Lauderdale and said I would have to “request a new driver sorry”. So then we got another Uber that delivered us to the right address.

I’ve finally hit my breaking point and have to voice this where a decision maker at the company might eventually hear. I have to request a ride with at least 30m of EXTRA cushion (above the average drive time) before I need to be somewhere as the matching process now takes at least 10m. Then you have to factor in the fact that at least two drivers cancel your pickup. Then another 10m match comes… until they just give up matching you. Lyft doesn’t have this problem - why does Uber? Immediately before writing this review three drivers cancelled my accepted ride, then Uber said there are “not enough drivers in the area, try again later.”

This is San Francisco - a tier 1 city where the company is even headquartered. I’m not complaining about this and being in some small city with no drivers.

To whoever is making decisions at Uber - you need to up the penalty for your drivers cancelling an accepted ride. They knew the fare beforehand. You can’t provide this inconsistent level of quality when it comes to transportation or people (like me) will drop your service.

I tried reaching customer service to explain my situation but was in a dead end and could not reach a representative. However, I tweeted about it and Uber support reached out within 5minutes. The fact that a representative had to reach out to me VIA Twitter instead of the Uber app speaks for itself. Uber should update their system. I was told that the upfront price was the same that they charged me which was not, I had the screenshot of the email where it stated that they updated the pricing last minute, and the screenshot of the bank statement as proof of the $22 hold instead of $33. They rather charge the customer extra than to advise their own drivers not to take their own route because it affects their ratings, tips, + customer experience.

Uber will tell you it’s a 5 min wait and a $12 trip and then make you wait up to 30 mins and charge you an extra $10 with very little explanation or heads up.

This needs to be addressed and needs to be fixed for both drivers and riders! Firstly they aren’t giving proper directions for drivers. They’ve been taking the drivers to the street behind my house and then they have to go around to get to my location. Then on the way to work it takes them way past my work to an Asian buffet. I work at petsmart and it wants to take the drivers past my work and then I have to give them directions myself. With Uber being the way it’s supposed to be I should not be having to tell drivers to make u-turns and other directions. Secondly, it’s not letting me tip! I’ve even updated the app and it won’t let me tip. Tells me something is wrong. So I’ve had to give drivers cash or no tip at all if I don’t have cash which makes me feel like a jerk because I don’t like not tipping people and I rarely have cash on me! Third, there’s an issue with getting rides through the app. If I want to book a ride I have to go on Ubers website because the app will tell me there’s no drivers but it doesn’t give this issue to my coworkers. I live in Las Vegas there are ALWAYS drivers EVERYWHERE so this isn’t right either. Please fix this!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-25T18:09:02-07:00

Little to complain about however: When I book a ride to LAX and the driver speaks ZERO English, Huston, we have a problem! What if I want to tell him to take another exit, or look for Alaska Airlines terminal and he leaves me off at United, pointing to his phone GPS which tells him I want to go to United? Really? Anyway, there was no way to have a conversation with him.

That leads to a more serious point. NO ONE, no matter how good their driving skills, should be driving passengers without enough English to communicate if the trip is longer than 15 minutes! LAX was 50 minutes away. It required highway and exits. What if there was traffic jam, an emergency or I wanted to reroute for any reason? I certainly would NOT have allowed my daughter or son to ride with someone who could not communicate.

I understand giving people a chance to make a living. I also acknowledge that the driver I had was an excellent one. But, he could not speak to or understand me. Asking drivers for a minimum of English speaking skills is not unreasonable. Furthermore, it is a safety issue for both driver and passenger. Uber, rethink this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-01T22:27:42-07:00

So today I had practice and I didn’t want to get the ride from my house I wanted to get it from a gas station a couple blocks from me so I looked up the address making sure it was correct and put it in as the pick up spot. My uber ended up going to a totally different place i wasn’t even sure where he was at i just know that he was on the wrong street. I know for a fact i put the right pick up spot because when i put in the address the name of the gas station popped up. The thing that made me upset the most was that if the driver saw that the pick up spot was a gas station then why are you in front of a house or even the street address at least. I texted the driver to ask where he was but I didn’t get a response I let him know that we were at the gas station didn’t get a response for that either. He ended up cancelling the ride and they charged me 6 dollars saying that next time i should be ready🤨. Why am i paying your driver for being at the wrong spot his time wasn’t wasted mines was and I was late to where I needed to be. I was very unsatisfied I shouldn’t have to go through all this just to a ride .,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-04T07:33:37-07:00

The different types of Uber rides are easy to select and they can be found quickly using the touch screen interface. The map is highly accurate and displays in real time where the driver is located so you can monitor your progress both too and from your destination. The trip is also tracked via time giving you an accurate estimate of the time between destinations. The driver can contact you and leave a message when they arrive so you do not have to keep them waiting. Finally, once the ride is complete you can rate them and leave a tip easily. The Uber drivers are always friendly and helpful when you get into the car. It helps to be prepared and alert for the trip just in case there are multiple routes to your destination of traffic delays. Truthfully, the app is a very convenient way of getting around and I use it frequently. I would recommend this application to anyone who needs a fast and accurately trackable way of getting from destination to destination.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-14T09:32:29-07:00

Matched with a Co-rider after I got picked up. GPS says the co-rider is in the middle of the street so the uber driver drives an extra 3 miles driving around in circles looking for my co-rider. He (the driver) doesn’t respond to the other riders text messages or the one phone call she made. So she (the Co-rider) cancels her ride. So all the time and the distance he drove looking for that woman was added to my charge which ended up being a bit over $16. I go to help section and press “driver got lost or took wrong turn” and was told my fare wouldn’t be adjusted because I was charged the price I was shown upfront. I then press “driver took poor route” and was told the same thing. I sent support multiple messages to support about the situation with no response. I even sent screenshots of his total driving distance (9.91 miles) and the true distance of my pick up and drop off which was 7.3 miles. My receipt from that ride shows a base charge, distance charge, and a time charge. Every ride I took that day that went from point to point with no problem don’t have those charges. But because he drove so off course I was charged for the extra time and distance he drove. WHICH makes no sense since a Uber pool or express has a set route the driver can’t deviate from. So if support wants to rob me so be it. Buyers be warned.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-09-20T08:23:13-07:00

BUT I did have a VERY scary experience with a driver some months ago who took me on a joy ride and was trying to pick a fight with me so he could kick me out. My daughter did find a VERY complicated process to report this driver but Uber needs to fix that!!!!!  This driver I’m sure was using someone else’s identity in order to be a driver for Uber because his photo looked NOTHING like the man who picked me up.  

Also AFTER you confirm your trip they can change the 4 minute arrival time to 15 minutes. And there’ll be a $5 cancelation fee then. I thinks that’s crap. I asked the driver how that happened and he said the driver that was 4min away must not have accepted the trip so he accepted the trip but was 15 minutes away. I could have driven myself in 15 minutes. So I really do not appreciate being asked to confirm the trip then get a “bait and switch” and get charged to cancel the trip. 

Great Ap but has some MAJOR issues they need to fix mainly for personal safety. They DO NOT VET THEIR DRIVERS!!!!!  Because that angry man who drove me was not the same man the had a photo of. Probably his friend applied and got him approved. This is DANGEROUS!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-19T17:09:28-07:00

I summoned a ride from the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas to Ceasars Palace. We had an appointment to make and had 45 minutes to get there, about 2 miles. We started waiting and watching the driver drive around in circles near and around our pickup point. All of the hotels have a designated place for Uber/ Lyft to pick up people. This driver apparently didn’t know where he was going. After about 20 minutes, and our appointment time looming, the driver cancels the ride. No phone call or anything. We were lucky enough to spot a cab which took us to our destination just in time. Now I get a $5.45 charge for not showing up for our ride! I’ve sent Uber a message but I’m not sure if it went to the correct place as the website wasn’t people friendly to use. We’ll see!! To be fair, we used Uber two more times over the weekend and had no issues, even had one driver call to confirm where we were waiting which is what the driver mentioned above should have done.

I asked, “They have Uber cards now?” The driver responded, “No, your gift card.” I replied, “Well, I loaded it on my app and it shows the funds are there, so I threw the card away.” The driver then informed me, in a eye rolling manner, “You have to keep the card or it can’t be used.” I stated, “It does not give any notice to do so, and looks/operates as a gift card. Therefore, I made the simple assessment it worked like every other gift card I’ve had in which I load the funds onto the company website, and no longer need the card.” The the driver stated that I cannot use my funds without the card, regardless if they’ve been loaded onto the app. Quickly after, the driver drove away.

We decided to order McDonalds for my daughter loves McDonalds. I placed the order and it was quick. However, first we didn’t get the cola that my husband requested and when he opened up the wrapper on the burger, he noticed that his burger was extremely raw. He immediately changed our daughters burger as well and it was also raw. Mine was not raw. So he was upset and called the McDonalds where we ordered from and the manager stated he cannot do anything for we had to call Uber. Upsetting as that may sound, it doesn’t get any better for we’ve looked for either and email or telephone number to Uber so we can get reimbursed for the two burgers and cola. To no avail. When you look for help none of the questions pertaining to this was available. There is not even an email so that I may write to them. Lastly when you sign up,, thinking perhaps I can get somewhere with this issue, it’s more to become an Uber Driver. So I had no chose to whip something up for dinner for us to enjoy with the only thing was good was the fries. So, so disappointing for I lost my money on a nasty raw burgers and no drink. If needed proof I can back that up for we took a photo. So disappointing to see there is no contact and we lost money.

One time I spent nearly an hour on the phone trying to guide an angry driver to my house, because the GPS simply doesn’t work, and they got mad at me for it. No customer or driver should have to deal with something like this malfunctioning when it’s so important to the process. I already did my part to check if my address was correct, and I actually made it a habit to put my address into the comment box to prevent this issue, which wouldn’t work because according to the drivers, “regardless of the address I put in, it’s taking me to a different area”. 

It’s unprofessional. Plain and simple. And I’m definitely only gonna use Uber if I absolutely have to. I mean seriously? It’s an app designed to drive people to their desired destinations, or for food delivery. But….the GPS doesn’t even work? 

Also, I’d like to mention: DO NOT GET UBER ONE FOR RIDES. Please do research and look up others experiences using Uber One with rides, you’ll see tons of evidence showing that they simply put fake prices and even charge you MORE than if you didn’t even have the subscription.

I have continued to use Lyft with no issues and have never been suspended from anything before so the mystery still remains. I used to use Postmates frequently, but lost that once it came under the Uber umbrella. I’m fine without them as I can use Lyft, Doordash etc but am annoyed because I feel like something must have compromised my account. I also just recently asked to be reactivated again and someone from CS wrote back that it was taken care of and there was a misunderstanding on my account but as soon as I tried to place an UberEats order, it failed and the suspension came back. I emailed CS again and the answer was that I would continue to be suspended. I travel a lot - enough to have status on multiple airlines and access to all airport lounges - so not having Uber as an alternative option to Lyft when needed is an annoyance. Especially since I do not understand what happened to cause the suspension.

I reach out to customer support and I’m told “you need to double check how much you’re tipping before submitting,” as if it’s my fault. I am fully aware of how much I tipped, it is not my problem the app has bugs, nor is it professional for customer support to blame the customer when I clearly told them there was an issue with the app. The resolution I was given was not a refund, but Uber cash, forcing me to just give it right back to the company that stole it from me.
