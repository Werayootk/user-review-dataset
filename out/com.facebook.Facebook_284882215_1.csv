I even , upon their request, scanned my drivers license for them to prove I was who I said i was. After all that I still was not able to sign in. After several frustrating days and numerous attempts I had to start all over. Now, i have to start all over and sometimes Facebook isn‚Äôt allowing me to friend some of my family and friends because they say I don‚Äôt know them. One person was my own daughter in law. It makes no sense to me that my account was stolen and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to chat or given a phone number of someone to talk to so we could have resolved the issue without me having to start all over .
