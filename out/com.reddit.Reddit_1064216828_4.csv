A greyed out button but nothing happens. Nothing gets posted. I can actually be involved in a conversation 30% of the time. No idea what the deal is but please fix this.

Is…..Reddit has the answers,"I’m a long time Redditor and short time review writer so I can’t promise you much in the way of quality review content. I can however, promise you that this app (community/website) will be more valuable than any of the social networking platforms. 
From 17 - 31 years old….. I have never been disappointed by the sheer number of topics, people, questions, answers, opinions, opportunities, etc that are neatly packed into one single website (app) and readily accessible to everyone and anyone from all walks of life and with such a polarizing scale of content, of which there seems to facilitate real authentic honest (or not honest depending on the content) discussion and information about literally everything you could think of. This community has been so influential and supportive in the least likely of ways for me and so many others. Need to vent? Reddit. Need some advice? Reddit. Need answers? Reddit. Want to share your art? Reddit. Want to pursue a questionable topic and its participants opinions or thoughts? Reddit. Need a recipe? Reddit. You think you got cursed? Reddit. Like to be helpful?

I’m not reddit savvy, but i am social media savvy and up to date with how individuals are. Been online most of my life being a “degen” or dealing with them. Karma or not people will find a way to bypass this, if they truly cared, but i am not ashamed to say I don’t. That being said, i have found myself on reddit more often than not. Signing up with alt accounts very often as i do not care much to keep up with a account. However there has been instances where I tried to get my karma up but it is so slow and not that easy unless something sets you up, which in retrospect, is not reliable. For new users how come wanting to speak on matters or ask questions it becomes hard unless you go under an already existing post and ask there, (which may even get you downvoted resulting in negative karma) I believe it’d be simpler to maybe not automod post that are based on karma points but instead trust in your users and communities to handle spam/negativity in a well obtained manner. That should why i gave it 4 stars. Too many times i tried to make a post and wouldn’t go through on any r/ due to no karma. Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-23T16:12:44-07:00
11077812643,180,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31842529,2024.12.0,5,Great app,Reddit has turned into a place with much less user engagement than a few years ago. Subreddits all have their own specific rules you must know before you post anything. The content on Reddit is vanilla and family friendly now. I used to get on Reddit and not want my 5 year old to see some of the stuff but now I feel like Reddit is made for children and I love it. The best way to have your comment or posts be read by anyone is to share the same opinion as the masses. If you can figure out what everyone else’s opinion is before you make your post then you won’t have to be downvoted into oblivion. Some of the massive subreddits I joined NEVER pop up in my home feed but that’s okay because I like to search for them all the time as I don’t follow many subreddits anyway. Still a lot of bots here but they all post vanilla content so no big deal. I love this app! I hope it keeps getting better.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-23T14:15:30-07:00
