I get that ads help pay the bills so I mostly ignore that which comes my way. That is until the recent multi-million dollar ad campaign by Hobby Lobby and other ultra-religious contributors to attempt to reframe the reactionary Christian attitudes via the He Gets Us campaign. I saw these offensive and misleading ads a few times and then promptly blocked the account. A few continued to pop up so I continued to block. Finally they went away…for a short while. These offensive ads have started popping up again and blocking does not work! I’m sure handfuls of money are being given to Reddit to run these ads but it’s beyond belief that users must endure them even after attempting to block them. It’s sick and it makes me spend less time on Reddit. I’m removing the app from my phone for now and will only use my phone browser or desktop for perusing Reddit.

The first one: whenever you click on posts and are scrolling through images/videos by swiping right or left rather then up and down (it’s hard to explain but you’ll know what I mean when you open the app) and you rotate your phone sideways, making the image flip as well, if you flip it back and exit out of that post, it takes you back several posts. It’s more tedious than anything really.

Second bug: this one is much more annoying. Whenever you get an alert that someone has responded to your post/comment, if you click on the alert banner it takes you to a blank page. You then have to exit out of that and go back to the alert/message screen and click on it from there. Even then, it’s pretty hit or miss on whether you’ll actually see the comment/response.

Third Bug: whenever you click on an alert, it will sometimes open up the post 5-10 times, forcing you to exit out of every post in order to get to the Home Screen.

I wish there was a fair platform that didn’t censor opinions but evidently there isn’t.

Also, why is it changed so you now swipe up/down instead of left/right? I feel the biggest problem is that there is way too much info on the screen when you’re in the new video player, the old and superior one just had the video length and progression, and the name of the sub.

- Cool it down with how much you force Reddit premium down everyone’s throat. The fancy avatars and trophy’s make the app feel very slow and bloated and can be very distracting from the actual content. Consider adding options to make this better for users who prefer a more concentrated layout like the Apollo app

- Fix the in app media player… seriously please do! Watching videos used to be very easy but when you decided to make everything scroll-based, it completely broke the experience and now if I want to actually view the profile behind the users post, I have to jump through a few hoops within the app just to get there.

- improve markdown controls on mobile when creating a post, desktop markdown controls are nice but when they are on mobile it feels very limiting and packed onto the screen

Being forced to sort by best because “99%” of users sort by best seems to make sense if you take it at face value. However, Reddit recently made Best the default and hid the sort in settings, meaning this startling metric was manufactured deliberately over the past two quarters. A strategic move to remove transparency and customizability, leaving Reddit free to evolve the algorithmic content delivery system in a way that maximizes profit at the expense of user experience. Hey, it’s a business, do what you have to do for the shareholders and stay competitive vs TikTok, but count me out. 

I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed.

It provides nothing of value.,"I deleted Reddit for the simple fact you’re not allowed to express your opinion about anything that runs even slightly contrary to what the power-obsessed moderators want to perpetuate.  Someone told me they “despise me” (although they’ve never met me) and I should be put “into a wood chipper” but I was banned from that particular sub for saying they were being hateful for no reason and wouldn’t have the spine to say that kind of nonsense to my face (which I know they wouldn’t, I’m 100% confident in that statement).

If you make any of these keyboard-warriors uncomfortable even a bit you’re done. This is the worst place to be if you want to have an actual conversation. Reddit doesn’t allow any discourse whatsoever and will even support people who tell you in plain English they hope you to die in a violent manner. It is a shame they support this behavior by encouraging people to act this way toward complete strangers. This is why mental illness is unfortunately at a fever pitch in our country.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-26T13:14:33-07:00
7521674103,VKStarfox,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id315840847,2021.25.0,1,App was fine before you guys tried to copy Tik Tok,"Seems you guys are trying to copy tik tok’s formula with your videos and as a result, the video viewing experience is worse now. Trying to scroll through comments while watching videos is a nightmare, and the button for auto-scrolling to the next message thread is completely missing. Combine that with how the buttons are automatically relegated vertically to the side when you watch a video (just like tik tok) and it’s honestly just a less enjoyable experience. 

Otherwise the app still works as normally everywhere else. I don’t get it. You guys had a good thing here, and I’m not sure why you felt pressured to copied tik tok’s design for videos. But I can’t imagine anyone who doesn’t use tik tok like myself will enjoy it this way; it just makes me want to watch videos less on it now. Here’s to hoping you guys change it back soon after this little experiment. Or come up with something better for your video viewing experience, cause this ain’t it chief.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-29T21:47:57-07:00
