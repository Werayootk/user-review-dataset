Is…..Reddit has the answers,"I’m a long time Redditor and short time review writer so I can’t promise you much in the way of quality review content. I can however, promise you that this app (community/website) will be more valuable than any of the social networking platforms. 
From 17 - 31 years old….. I have never been disappointed by the sheer number of topics, people, questions, answers, opinions, opportunities, etc that are neatly packed into one single website (app) and readily accessible to everyone and anyone from all walks of life and with such a polarizing scale of content, of which there seems to facilitate real authentic honest (or not honest depending on the content) discussion and information about literally everything you could think of. This community has been so influential and supportive in the least likely of ways for me and so many others. Need to vent? Reddit. Need some advice? Reddit. Need answers? Reddit. Want to share your art? Reddit. Want to pursue a questionable topic and its participants opinions or thoughts? Reddit. Need a recipe? Reddit. You think you got cursed? Reddit. Like to be helpful?

11077812643,180,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31842529,2024.12.0,5,Great app,Reddit has turned into a place with much less user engagement than a few years ago. Subreddits all have their own specific rules you must know before you post anything. The content on Reddit is vanilla and family friendly now. I used to get on Reddit and not want my 5 year old to see some of the stuff but now I feel like Reddit is made for children and I love it. The best way to have your comment or posts be read by anyone is to share the same opinion as the masses. If you can figure out what everyone else’s opinion is before you make your post then you won’t have to be downvoted into oblivion. Some of the massive subreddits I joined NEVER pop up in my home feed but that’s okay because I like to search for them all the time as I don’t follow many subreddits anyway. Still a lot of bots here but they all post vanilla content so no big deal. I love this app! I hope it keeps getting better.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-23T14:15:30-07:00

There’s soOo many different topics and communities here on Reddit, it’s awesome how this app allows its users that are of different ages, gender, religious/political affiliations, and cultures, etc,… to connect/interact while being able to express our individual opinions, beliefs, creativity, ask questions, and learn something new in the process💯🤭..and it’s so easy to navigate -&- explore all the various features Reddit offers. I don’t usually write CV reviews, but..
…Despite being *new to the app but I love it already. Definitely the best social media/news app I’ve seen so far. I can see 👀why it’s called: “The Heart💜of the Internet🛜..”
