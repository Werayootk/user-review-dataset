I find this to be really engaging and make me want yo use Reddit more. 3)the bots that downvote real user posts/comments and upvote their own accounts. Reddit feels very fake this days. What was once a community allowing you to interact with other people has turned into a structured community that deletes everything outside its agenda. These changes have opened the door for AI to fill the void of real users leaving Reddit. This apps algorithm for showing things is off too. I have a subreddit I’m following that never shows in my feed, ever. Maybe I was shadow banned. I dunno I don’t comment enough to be shadow banned. Also, why does this app still have a 4.8 star rating given all the low ratings the past 2 years? That’s probably an Apple issue. Saying things like this is probably why I get shadow banned.
