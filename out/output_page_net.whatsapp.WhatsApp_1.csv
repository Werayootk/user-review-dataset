10763728139,桑原智也,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1277336176,23.25.85,1,Frustrating Experience with Account Ban and Poor Support,"I recently faced an extremely disappointing experience with WhatsApp while traveling overseas. After updating my phone number in the app, my account was inexplicably banned within minutes. Efforts to appeal the ban were unsuccessful, as I was met with a permanent ban, just days before Christmas, leaving me stranded without any means to contact my friends and family through the app.

The support process was equally disheartening. Over several days, the support team provided no clear resolution, repeatedly asking the same questions and offering generic, non-sensical responses. They insisted on verifying my account through the app, which was impossible due to the ban. Moreover, their claim of me violating their terms of service was vague, with no specific details provided. Eventually, they inaccurately accused me of using a third-party app, which was not the case since I only had the official WhatsApp app.

This ordeal cost me over 6 years of accumulated activity, valuable contacts, and control over a group where I was the admin. The lack of effective support and the arbitrary nature of the ban have significantly diminished my trust in WhatsApp. If it weren't for others using the platform, I would have abandoned it altogether. This has been one of the worst experiences I've had with a service in a long time, and I urge potential users to consider this when deciding to use WhatsApp.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T10:32:40-07:00

As a WhatsApp user and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your constant update in making the app better, such as editing, pinning messages and other stuff. During the last update few things were changed which i did not really like, 1. When i choose a photo or a video now the newest is on the top left of the screen and not on the bottom right as it used to be. This makes a HUGE difference because in IOS if i TAP on the CLOCK on the top of the screen it will AUTOMATICALLY scroll to the beginning, now when this is reversed, I am missing this feature. 2. Same thing happened to starred messages. Now new on top, not bottom. Same thing I cannot scroll all the way to the beginning by tapping on the clock on top. 3. Now typing in Arabic is just weird, because in Arabic we write from right to left, not like English from left to right. Now if i want to type in Arabic the cursor will remain on the left side of typing panel and words will start moving from left to right, which is not supposed to happen like this.

I just do not appreciate that ya’ll did not try the bare minimum to at least investigate my case at all before deleting my account.. this means that I can just spam a bunch of reports on randoms peoples accounts and ya’ll will delete their account right without doing any investigation to see if what I’m reporting is true or not?

For years it has been difficult, if not impossible to easily list the groups that you are a member of. As a result, duplicate groups get made because people forget that a similar group had already been created in the past, and there is no easy way to quickly list and edit the groups you are member off. There are hacks you can find on the internet to get around this problem, but for heavy users like me who belong to dozens of groups, this is a source of endless frustration. This last version finally offers a partial workaround, that is that in the new communities section you can pretend to create a new community and see in the process a list of the groups to which you have admin privileges. But this is just another work around, and it does not show you the groups that you are only a member of. For such a mature program to lack such a basic feature passes understanding. If this was 1.0 version of the software I’d give it 4 stars. But for a program that’s been on the market for years, this omission is inexcusable, especially considering that competing platforms allow you to manage groups with ease.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-09T03:52:25-07:00

Customer support does not exist. There is nobody to talk to. You can send an email, but you’ll get an automated reply. They said that you could wait seven days to log into your account without a six-digit pin and delete your account that way. So while you wait the seven days, they have full access to your account and number.

I have never heard of a hack or security breach into WhatsApp security systems. Overall the App has been great and has eased the way the world has connected via talking and sharing digital and graphical data. 

The only downside to WhatsApp is that when you lose your device or are out of storage and uninstall the app, you typically lose all your previous chats and data.

Right in the midst of providing crucial information to the hotel for my pickup arrangement, WhatsApp abruptly disabled my number. I promptly submitted a review request to reinstate my number, but to my utter dismay, WhatsApp not only failed to address the issue but completely banned my number!

I found myself stranded in the remote mountains of Peru, desperately needing to contact the hotel for pickup. Unfortunately, the hotel didn't answer my phone calls, and I couldn't communicate in the local language. To make matters worse, this happened just as the sun was setting.

Additionally, it’s wayyy too easy to send things to the wrong person. You can’t remove people from “recently contacted” or “frequently contacted” prompts around iOS for sharing. I’m terrified I will send my girlfriends brother something immodest because his name shows above hers even though our chat volumes are way different.

On Instagram, when you record a voice message it utilizes the iPhone mic instead of the AirPod mic even when using the AirPods. When I am having a conversation with someone via voice memos on WhatsApp, I have to turn off Bluetooth, then record my voice memo. After I’m done recording I have to turn Bluetooth back on. It goes on and off indefinitely until I am done with my conversation.

The conversation wether individual or in chat groups are more user friendly than WhatsApp. It allows recalling a wrong message sent in mistake. Attaching files and emojis are awesome. My only complain is that once viewed in one device the message cannot be reviewed in an other, which FB allows all history conversation once logged in. 

I lived in America over 47 years. I highly recommend friends to use WeChat for daily contacts over other apps.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2017-10-14T12:29:19-07:00

The only thing I would change is how easy it is to call people by accident. It happens all the time. I wish they would hide that button behind the profile page. This is mostly a texting app, do we really need that button on the first page?Even on an iPhone you have to first click the i button from the message page to call someone. It’s smart. 
Another issue is that the app distorts the quality of pics and videos after they are sent. I often receive videos with delayed sound and fuzzy images. I have to ask my contacts to send me those through other apps so I can actually get the proper sound.

Latest update introduced more bugs. Now screen moves up and bottom half turn black and you can’t use the app properly. Every time this requires user to completely close app and re-open it again.

Please fix these bugs and do more testing before you release updates. 

At least you fixed the more annoying bugs mentioned below. Thanks for that. 

Dear Developers, this last update totally screwed up the app. - I’m getting blank screens where you can see the text box while typing. - The list of chats keeps moving down before you can select on it (so you enter the wrong chat) or - when stationary it always selects the chat below the one you select. So you have to select another chat to get into the one you want. Seriously? Revert to a previous safe build and do more testing before you push new updates out, it’s becoming annoying enough to make me want to report these bugs in a review. Happy to submit screen shots or video with version/phone info if needed (latest updated iOS and WhatsApp updated). Other then that my only other WhatsApp suggestions is -to allow users to edit or delete their messages (outside of disappearing messages) - to allow chat backup to other drives or apps or make it easier to use",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-18T04:13:08-07:00
