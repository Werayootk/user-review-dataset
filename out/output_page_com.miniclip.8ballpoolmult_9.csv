Next thing I know, the balls that were already broken on the table were mirror reflected on how they were already broken and then it was his turn. He lost his turn 4 balls in. So I start playing and no later did I get a ball in the table was once again turned and it was his turn (even though I sunk a ball.)

First of all, the matchmaking is a joke. Either you get some “guest” that never misses, or you ALWAYS end up playing people 100+ in rank, and they’ve all had 500+ million in winnings. 

Second, there are so many ads, it’s hard to find the actual playable game through them all. And it just begs you constantly to spend money on the app. 

Third, there’s a lot of randomness in shots. Found that out when I had some weird glitch where I would make a shot, see everything happen, and then boom, randomly nothing was where it was before. Fix that.

And last, this game basically steals your chips, then the amount of chips you get every 4 real life hours, is only 50. Then when you play with those 50, you play someone ranked 100+ who destroys you immediately. Feels like it wants you to pay for more coins and better cues huh?

Btw, I decided to leave this review after getting upset and doing an all in bet, if I won one of the best of 3, I decided I wouldn’t leave this review. I played someone rank 168 (I’m rank 23), he had 10 BILLION (10,000,000,000. That’s 10 whole zeroes) in winnings, while I had 1.3 million (1,300,000). I didn’t get a fair shot to even try.

According to conventional pool, whatever color ball you put in first after you break the rack is the color you should be in charge of trying to hit in. The game makes it work less than half of the time. Also, the game wants you to directly hit the ball in, which means that you cannot hit an opponent’s ball into yours and have yours go in as a result of that. In conventional pool, you can do whatever means necessary to hit your ball in as long as you don’t scratch or accidentally hit the 8-ball in.

There’s times when I would hit the ball in the hole and it would just go side to side and bounce away from the hole. Third reason, the cue meter is broken and it’s rigged. While taking my time on how hard I should hit, the cue would just release by itself when I didn’t let go. Final reason is the stretching part, it’s literally impossible for me to have a game without scratching and whenever the white ball stopped moving by the hole, it would just fall in by itself.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-18T11:19:10-07:00

But one HUGE issue I have is when I click to play a game and it freezes (even though I have perfect signal) and then I have to shut down the app only to come back and see they still took all my coins! It’s such a massive flaw I don’t understand how it hasn’t been fixed. Maybe don’t take the persons coins until the rack has been broke? Something! It makes it very hard to grow whenever you bet all your coins trying to move to the next difficulty only to have them all drained and have to start over. Well of course this same issue just happened again. When I complained about this last time I was simply told to “get over it and they don’t guarantee my coins”. So pathetic customer service.

I am one of the people who started with nothing and have built my way to 1.3 billion. Take it from me - if this game wants your opponent to break, they will. If they want you to break but end up in a position to turnover, then you shall. Whatever happens after the break is 10% skill but by that time, the game has been decided. If you spent money on this game it’s because you wanted to see cooler looking cues. Truth is, you don’t need them, you just don’t. Miniclip needs to change players break ratios. 50/50. I played 10 games (9 Ball) just now and didn’t break a single time. I was lucky to win 2 of those games. This game is rigged and sorry Miniclip, I won’t fall for it, I won’t gamble all my money in order to tempt me to buy coins.

Sadly it’s ruined by an inundation of ads for in app purchases, overpriced pro membership, and rigged gambling mechanics. 

You are constantly bombarded with ads for in app purchases. Such as for season passes, pro membership, loot boxes, in-game currency, etc. They appear when you open the game, lose a match, and at any other random time.

The pro membership is currently $20 a month. You get some features like better loot boxes, leveling up faster, and better rewards for gambling. It’s just not worth it. It wouldn’t be that bad if you weren’t constantly having to decline pop ups offering it for purchase. 

The gambling aspects of the game are not in and of themselves bad, but they cost to much, and they are rigged. In one game you spin a wheel and win whatever it lands on. It appears that you have approx 1 in 10ish chance of winning the grand price. After months of daily spins plus spins I won by leveling, I not once won more than the minimum prize. 

The Developers have to monetize the game somehow. Since it’s free to play I can tolerate the in game currency, season passes, gambling games, loot boxes, and pro membership. The issue is it’s over done. It’s constantly forced in your face to the point it detracts from your enjoyment of the game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-04T20:55:02-07:00
