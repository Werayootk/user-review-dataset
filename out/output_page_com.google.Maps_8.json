Really annoying. \n\nSecondly, when directions are going it no longer tells your total miles left to the destination, only the total time. That’s not always as helpful, especially if you hit traffic. Being able to see both time and distance left to destination is essential. \n\nLastly, I have had way too many times where I choose an alternate route (not the fastest), but midway through the route it switches back to the “fastest” route, taking me through areas I wanted to avoid. It’s incredibly frustrating. \n\nTo sum it up, the app would be better if it showed the time and service bars while routing, showed time AND distance to the destination, and did not change the route to the fastest route after deliberately choosing a specific route (suggesting another route is fine, but default to no when doing so).","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-06-21T15:19:13-07:00"},{"id":"5957265831","userName":"Zcilent","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id935614876","version":"5.43","score":1,"title":"I truly love this app, but...","text":"I’ve given 1 Star just to try and bring some attention to this issue. \n\nI’ve happily used google maps basically ever since I owned my first phone.

I noticed a few days ago that my phone’s battery was consistently draining way faster than usual, and upon taking a look at the battery usage breakdown, I found that for the past few weeks google maps has been using a lot more battery than usual in what is started as “background use”. I ran some tests and realized that if I didn’t open the app in the entire day and didn’t have it open in the background, it would consume 2-3% of my phone’s battery a day. But if I so much as opened it and didn’t terminate the background process, it would consume anywhere from 25-32% of my battery just by having opened it and not using the navigation feature. \n\nI figured it would be fixed with a future update but it hasn’t. \n\nToday, for the first time in 15+ years I considered looking for another alternative.

This causes you to have to constantly monitor the behavior of the app since it will no longer follow the chosen route which is down right deceptive and dangerous. I have since had to revert to Apple Maps after several instances of this behavior and am seeing that hundreds of other users are experiencing the same behavior.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-28T11:24:21-07:00"},{"id":"5947285136","userName":"Spitfire3455","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id963150514","version":"5.43","score":3,"title":"IDk man, I love and hate. A little too much tracking","text":"I don’t know man, I really don’t know how I feel about this service. Like most people today I’m horrible with maps and have a horrible sense of direction. This app has never failed me. It makes everything so much easier. It’s helped me with navigating through small little country roads no one would know but their great grandpa. \nIt’s also helped me navigate to the nearest gas stations, restaurants, and gyms in big cities I’ve never been in before. \nTrust me, I’m not a paranoid “big brother” is watching type at all. \nIt’s been very helpful. \n\nBUT... I was messing around with some of the features tonight, and I’ve learned that it’s been tracking my every move. \n\nLiterally. A little too much, like it’s assumed stops at places that I’ve never been, But most likely walked or driven by. \n\nIt’s been tracking my every move for the past 6/7 years.\n \nEVERYTHING. \nThings and places I don’t even remember until I re-discover them through my location history. \n\nLol I ain’t bout this. \n\nHopefully this review is helpful to you. I want you to take this with a light heart (because it’s funny), but also, realize how much of yourself (privacy) that you’re giving to these companies and developers.  \n\n✌🏻❤️","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-14T22:51:15-07:00"}]
