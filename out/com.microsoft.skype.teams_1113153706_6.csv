One complaint I have with teams in general is that it has made communication more messy.  People never know when to send a teams message vs an email.  And with point to point communication a lot of people are also missing out on items they should be included in.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-31T06:40:47-07:00

Some names are just not available. It is weird. They are people that I chat with frequently. This appears to happen only for meeting chats. It would be logical if I could add nobody or anybody, but Teams has decided only some people will never be added to a meeting chat.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-31T04:29:21-07:00
