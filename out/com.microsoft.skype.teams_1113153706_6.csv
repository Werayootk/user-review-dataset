The new paneled/columnar view on iOS for teams uses screen real estate very poorly. I now have 20% of my screen to find my one of hundred of appointments via a stupid infinite scroll or by tapping on a tiny monthly calendar view that takes up 5% of my screen. Do you people only have 2 appointments on your calendar that this is OK? Moreover a whopping 60% of my screen is dedicated to a ‚Äúselect an item to view‚Äù which presumably populates once I find said appointment. How about making this appear in a context dependent setting once you click on an appointment? Also, I‚Äôm unclear on how one goes about switching back. Maybe this new view is great for someone else, but it is garbage to me, rendering it mostly unusable. So instead I‚Äôll go to outlook to open a teams appointment.

10833213000,Drew5555,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id25271162,5.23.0,4,Solid app; minor annoyances,"Overall the Teams app is very good and I‚Äôm glad to use it most of the time. I‚Äôve had only one issue with basic functionality but otherwise it‚Äôs been rock-solid.

In terms of issues and annoyances, the biggest issue for me is that my most common use case for using the app is to join the audio of a call I‚Äôve already joined from my laptop. However when I do this, the options Teams presents me with are to transfer the call or join without audio, neither of which do I want to do. So I end up joining a call on my laptop, then joining on my phone and transferring the call (I have to do it in this order due to a Teams platform design issue), then finally re-joining on my laptop. It‚Äôs a huge hassle when a simple option to join without either transferring or losing audio (or, better yet, joining audio only) is all I need.

Another behavior of this app I dislike is that it logs call history in the iPhone‚Äôs native Phone app. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs due to Microsoft or Apple‚Äôs call design but it is highly undesirable as I do not like my work matters to bleed into my personal apps on my personal phone. 

The final annoyance is that the volume level is often too high for me, and the ability to control it is restricted. Often I am trying to turn the volume down but it is already at the lowest level my iPhone allows. It seems I am always using the 10-40% volume range, so I‚Äôm cramped in my ability to fine-tune loudness as different voices (of varying volume) speak on a call. Even the ability to reduce volume below the lowest iPhone ‚Äúnotch‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work as the volume just reverts (although this may be an iPhone design issue as well related to calls, but I never feel the volume is too loud in calls). (For what it‚Äôs worth, the issue of loudness in Teams calls is also present on my laptop, where I typically keep my volume at somewhere between 2 and 8 out of 100-point scale, with anything over about 35-40 being deafening, so I suspect this is a platform problem just ‚Äúinherited‚Äù by the app.)

There have also been a few bugs, but the only one I was able to replicate consistently was that if I joined a call from my laptop on the web first *without audio*, then joined from my phone, I would not be able to unmute in the mobile app.

All in all, though, this is a pretty good app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-17T11:40:38-07:00
