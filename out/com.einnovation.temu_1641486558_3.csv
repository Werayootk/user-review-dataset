But I gave them a chance and I’m so glad I did.  My order came in 2 parcels. That scared me even though they assured me that it was fine. I had ordered 24 things. One item showed up. It was a locator tag for my cat…so considered an electronic item. We were so pleased to learn that it is much nicer than we expected. For the price it’s a treasure. My 2nd parcel came a couple days later still 3 days before their projected delivery date. Every thing was there but 1 item had a piece missing.  I went into my delivery email and I was able to report it and this company immediately initiated a refund. And I had a choice of refund to my payment method or a credit.  No quarrel. No challenge. 
I am very pleased with everything. The quality is above expectations. My cat is having a blast with his toys. I’m very happy with some stocking stuffers for next Christmas.  I’ve already placed another order they have great incentives.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-08T17:05:49-07:00

But let me tell you all of it is true. Except getting the free stuff part, you have to invite friends and do a bunch of other things just to get a few things for free. But overall I love to shop on here because even though it’s cheap, the products are still amazing and look almost like they should cost more than what their worth. Other than that the only problem I see is that when it offers you a bundle of coupons, you’d think you get to spend them in your own way. For example: if I purchased an item and got a $100 coupon bundle; you can’t choose it and spend it with items you’ll purchase. It will only allow you to use it if you spend a certain amount of money. 

Lastly I enjoyed everything about this app and would recommend downloading it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-02T21:59:52-07:00

Like I invited a whole new user that was new to the app all together. When I invited her I was only given 30 tokens, but when I invited somebody else that was already an user I got 160 tokens. I'm not understanding why I wasn't given more than 30 on the new user I inivited.
& then when I invited the other two users I was only given 15 tokens all together which leaves me 5 tokens away from spinning the wheel. Except now I would have to invite yet another new person in order to actually spin the wheel when the app keeps saying I was only 1 invite away from winning. You guys have a way of making people think they have a chance at actually winning when they really don't.
Oh and not only that when you get to needing only a few dollars like $3 for example to win the wheel purposely only allows you to win $1 instead of $2, $3, or $5. It's completely set up to get people to constantly keep inviting others.

I also got a really sturdy and elegant case for my iPad, along with a few other small things.

I got a refund though and I didn't need to send the item back. The refund I chose was for temu store credit but you can also ask for an actual money refund if you are willing to wait for a good month or so.

Aside from shipping times ranging from 2-3 weeks, the price and selection here is fantastic. You can find anything from 99 cent jewelry to entire gaming consoles! 

The free gift system, like the money tree and the fishing game in the app, is very much geared towards getting new users to sign up. Although they do offer several free items, it’s very difficult to attain said items. Makes sense, especially considering the already low cost of the items sold. I wish they would adjust this system to allow for more chances at these “gifts”, even if it involves less gifts.

The sheer variety and quality of their offerings combined with their competitive prices are a shopper's dream come true.

Temu has consistently impressed me with their commitment to affordability. They've managed to strike a balance between quality and cost that's truly commendable. Whether I'm looking for tech gadgets, accessories, or everyday essentials, I've found their prices to be incredibly reasonable.

But it's not just about affordability – it's also about the fantastic products they offer. The range is vast, and I've discovered unique and high-quality items that I wouldn't have come across otherwise. It's like a treasure trove of practical and fun finds.

What's equally noteworthy is the user-friendly shopping experience. Their website or app is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through their product offerings and place orders. Plus, their customer service has been responsive and helpful in case I've had any questions or concerns.

In summary, Temu has been my go-to destination for affordable and fantastic products. It's a place where you can shop with confidence, knowing you'll get excellent value for your money. If you're looking for a budget-friendly and enjoyable shopping experience, I highly recommend giving Temu a try.

All of the app’s competitors allow all their users to have one, and it diminishes the experience of shopping with Temu that they don’t give one to everyone. They also have a minimum check out amount that other competitor apps do not have, if I am specifically looking for one thing, I don’t want to spend more than I need to. My other complaint is actually with their free gifts. Most are impossible to get unless you have a social media following. Not many people know a new app user or have a bunch of people they can share the link to. Also for many of the games, they purposely make it incredibly difficult or impossible to obtain. I get it, it’s a free gift, but some of their information is incredibly misleading or inaccurate. I’m not sure it’s worth spending the time on their free gift programs.

Boy was I wrong!! They compress everything so it’s like a bunch of vacuum storage bags… and boy did they plump up… I couldn’t get the clothes back into the box! I got 2 very nice winter coats for my grandkids and they fit perfect. I will say you need to pay attention to the sizing charts for each item. That includes purses or toys…EVERYTHING. It does tell you their measurements. 

I have since made 2 more larger purchases. One came yesterday and unfortunately I have to return 2 of the items. 1 pair of jeans and a dress w/hoodie. They are just too big.

I have several things that I have not received adding up to several hundred dollars, I cannot get a response and I just received a notice that they can’t reach me. I don’t understand why everybody else can. I’ve got over 100 different things on my phone where everybody else can seem to get a hold of me but not Teemu I ordered the first thing I ordered was, a set of shower curtain and rugs for peace. I got the rugs but not the shower curtain. That was a couple of months ago and I’m still waiting for it and I’m still asking for it and I still haven’t received it and another thing was the wash, the 2.11 pound washing machine I’ve ordered four of them and never received one and I was charged. I would appreciate it very much a Temu would do something about this as soon as possible.

The product selection on Temu is remarkable, with a wide range of high-quality items available. Whether you're searching for clothing, electronics, home decor, or even beauty products, Temu has you covered. The variety of options ensures that there's something for everyone.

What impressed me the most about Temu is their exceptional customer service. I had a question about a product, and their support team responded promptly, providing me with all the information I needed. They were friendly, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to assist me.

The ordering process was seamless, and my purchase arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was secure, and everything was in perfect condition. It's evident that Temu values customer satisfaction and takes great care in delivering a positive buying experience.

I highly recommend Temu to anyone in need of a reliable online store. With their wide range of products, top-notch customer service, and speedy delivery, you won't be disappointed. Temu has truly earned my admiration for their commitment to excellence.""

I hope this review captures your positive experience with Temu! If there's anything else I can assist you with, feel free to let me know.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-30T00:42:44-07:00

I’ve decided not to keep some things I ordered but you can’t just return them you have to take a picture of the item along with this whole process for each product of why you are returning it.

1. The minimum that they have when trying to order. Let’s say you had a $5 -10 dollar order. They would make you add other stuff and it has to be $15 or above. I don’t understand this at all.. 

2. Free gifts, Now it’s nice that we get free gifts and don’t always have to pay but the way you get the free gifts is almost ridiculous and a waste of time. When you first click on it you pick out your gifts of course but when it’s time to actually get them they make you send multiple links to your friends and yes they do work but when it gets close to the end after they take away some of the money they lower how much it takes away. As if they want you to keep doing it and wasting time😐

 I’m currently playing the fishland game and feeding fish. Not only did they lower it they are making it to where the fish need more and more food and it makes me keep sending. I’ll give an example ( first it took away 5 dollars every time , then i only had to feed the fish 2 times. now they are only taking away 0.2€ and makes me feed them 4-5 times and i constantly have to send more and more links. All i ask is that they stop doing this and just keep it to what it was the first time because it’s kind of a waste of time,frustrating, and boring.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-05T23:54:56-07:00

That was especially interested in how there’s a variety of items that you can get from the platform. Some are winners and some are less than desired but it’s incredibly nice and quite fantastic.

For the price cut one, you’ll always wind up getting the highest amount off but then you can get it unless “you refer someone” which even then you still probably won’t. Fishland and farmland seem a bit less sketchy but what I realized with Fishland when you have less fish it takes a lottttt more food to feed them. Like sometimes 10g of food won’t get go up 1%.

I was like ok that’s fine i guess I’ll just harvest another wear plant and get another 50¢. I only get 30¢, this is what really te the frosting on the cake because it took me almost 1/2 weeks jus to get to the end and only get half of what I need, don’t get me wrong I love the app but not the little games they have that make it seem all scam-ish. The app isn’t a scam but it’s crazy someone can wait all that time jus to get a little portion of what they need. I LOVE THE APP THO🤍",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-26T09:16:09-07:00
10395245990,fuckthistrashapp,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1272504502,2.7.0,1,Never received anything. Straight up scam,"This app is awful in every measurable way. Too good to be true is spot on. Customer support is a joke and the company they outsource local shipping with (OnTrac) is the least trustworthy company on the market. Drivers will just keep your package and say it’s been delivered. Nobody either with temu or OnTrac is ever held accountable. I have been digging around and I only see fake five star reviews and real ones (all one star) claiming they’ve either had their cc info stolen and never received their items or they have simply never received the items. Credible sources also suggest this company is using illegal child labor to produce goods. I find this hard to believe only due to the fact that nobody has been receiving their packages. If you want an honest review, go to temu’s reviews on the BBB (better business bureau) and you’ll see their true colors. This company is more than likely using illegal practices and should be shut down immediately. It’s a shame that the Apple Store is allowing this garbage app on their platform. I only pray that it’s removed before more innocent people are scammed like myself and everyone else.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-22T07:49:38-07:00
10466289809,fabulousweirdo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1450531141,2.10.0,4,Temu is awesome.,"I love Temu. I order almost everything I buy from here and am usually satisfied 90 percent of the time. You have to watch the size on things cause it may be behind a couch but be 8 by 19 but really did you think something that big was 2.98 ? They’re great about refunds and price adjustments if the price goes down in 30 days. All in all I have never ordered from a place that works so hard to please you. And if your order is late they compensate you 5 bucks! What?!😳The only reason they got four stars instead of 5 is because sometimes I feel like customer service gets a little persnickety with me but it’s hard to tell in a text. And they have a spot called earn credits I think where you can pick out a free item if you order. It gives you a bonus back an extra 5 percent off. Not to crazy about the games cause they start off fast but slow down to where it takes forever to get anything. But all in all,they rock!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-12T08:22:33-07:00
9882655824,ash4lyn,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1268380531,1.66.0,2,Temu App,"Ima be honest i’d like to give it a 3 or 4 star but there’s a bunch of things i want to talk about. i’m not sure if anyone will see this but whatever. I know i’m not the only one who thinks Temu chooses the things for you when you play the games. For example; the credit game, it gives many options of cents, tickets, and then the big one which is 100 credits. I honestly think that’s a total rip off, and especially because Temu is cheap and that’s the reason why i like it and it has many things at such a good price yet the app is so like so bad. Plus, i don’t even know why they added a minimum of 10$ when you buy something. I tried buying something of 0.35 cents with the credits i earned by the games. When i saw it had to be a 10$ minimum, i was very disappointed. i don’t know if this app is a scam, or just likes ripping people off just to pay the price. Doesn’t even let me buy something with the credits i win. But overall, i guess i like it for how cheap it is and has many good things, the games are fun to earn despite the fact it choose for you though.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-01T15:19:43-07:00
9941487855,C71lau,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1529931334,1.70.0,3,Not 100% satisfied,"Although Temu is relatively cheap, also the quality of products are extremely cheap and poor. So far I had 3 missing items in my orders, but Temu has been good refunding me. 
The time to receive the orders is too long, they should process stuff faster and give real and updated tracking information. Some packages will show the same tracking info for days, and then out of the blue is right your door. So no true tracking is provided. Sometimes is FedEx and sometimes other provider. 
I waited over 1 hr and 45 mins online to actually chat with one of the customer service reps, since they do not provide any phone help. So I think Temu needs to have a phone number were as a customer will be able to call and get issues resolve. 
Overall in my opinion Temu is to buy things that are not that important to you, since Temu stuff is poor quality. But if you really want something to last, for the long run, pay a little extra and get better quality somewhere else.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-18T17:55:24-07:00
9938484661,shay471,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id727519999,1.70.0,1,Questionable Practices,"I actually was pleasantly surprised with this company after receiving a few things. We have now ordered quite a bit from household items, clothes, beauty, health and many many more categories. Shipping about 10 days, but free. Unfortunately, they also have games they encouraged to win rewards when goal reached. It’s great initially even when sending invite to temu app to people (expanding their customer base), which should be mutually beneficial and appreciated. However, at the end of game over weeks of time, suddenly problems from worst to the worst double talk excuses/reasons of issue, unresolved after a lot of time on chat, there reasons from “randomly”, “high risk”, “security reasons”. Yep, I think HLS might of trained customer service in unintelligible jargon in hopes it’s believable their app vetted for top level clearance and instantly blocked invites sent, never received at the end when reaching reward promised. I will not hold my breath waiting for supervisor to investigate and call me with a resolution. Just feel unethical to use good customers who bring more and losing them, as well as ones they brought with their practices shared.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-17T21:35:33-07:00
