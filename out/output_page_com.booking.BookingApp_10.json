The hotel evidently had been purchased by a hotel chain catering to large tour groups. \nThe front desk personnel were unpleasant and downright rude. The lovely lobby bar had been renovated, but sadly, according to the manager, was never to be open because they did not have a bartender for it. The great service was gone and in its place was a hotel that cared little for the individual. They served breakfast, but you had to get your own coffee. Kleenex was no longer supplied in the rooms, nor was water even though we were told to drink bottled water because Santorini water was not potable. Water was charged to our rooms. \nSome of what I have said would lead one to think that we were too picky. The sad thing is that the cost per night was very high compared to other visits, yet the wonderful service had disappeared. \nNever again...\n\nI will no longer recommend the Santorini Palace to any of my friends.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-05-31T14:59:23-07:00"},{"id":"10355451175","userName":"Celeste travel","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1131027325","version":"40.7.3","score":5,"title":"Best views and service in all Giza","text":"Mamlouk has been our home away from home in these two weeks traveling Egypt.
