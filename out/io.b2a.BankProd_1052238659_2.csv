Monzo is not just a banking app, it‚Äôs a budgeting app. It does so much more than an average banking app would do, and everything it does, it does truly great. There are certain features that any bank has, but Monzo doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs something that is a little disappointing, but I still prefer this over the other options. I appreciate that they are continuing to develop it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-12T06:19:37-07:00

No problems in that department. The main issue is communication with customer service and getting access to your account again. I‚Äôve been having issues logging in because I don‚Äôt have access to my email account. In my opinion that should be a top priority as well as other things. It has taken me since March 23rd (it‚Äôs now April 1st) to get things in motion. The first time I reached out, they never responded back. After repeatedly sending them the information they‚Äôve requested‚Ä¶Finally after going back and forth for 24 hours and being ‚Äútransferred ‚Äú to another specialist, they let me know to contact US support. LOL. So that‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm at. Emailing the ‚ÄúUS‚Äù support team and starting over. So hopefully it doesn‚Äôt take a week for them to update my email address so I can log into my account.

**Update** they closed my account. I jumped through hoops just to have my account closed lol. Hopefully they don‚Äôt take months to give me my funds in my account. 

Just a note: add another way to verify your account! Add a pass phrase or give your users another option with using their verified phone number to get the access code! That should help things run more efficiently.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-02T05:47:34-07:00

9538664256,henry0319,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id737377233,5.8.0,4,Lots of potential,"I like the instant funding option - very convenient. Setting certain transactions as repeating payments is a very nice feature for subscriptions and under the ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù tab you can see these recurring payments. I like that you can add notes, tags and receipts to every transaction. The budgeting tool is not very helpful to me personally, but the Trends feature is - it helps to see how you‚Äôre using your money. The Pots have a ‚Äúscheduled payments‚Äù option, but it should really say ‚Äúscheduled transfers‚Äù because Pots are not for making payments - they are just to set money aside. To use money from Pots you have to transfer it back to main account. If I could make payments directly from a ‚ÄúBills‚Äù Pot with its own account number then ‚Äúscheduled payments‚Äù would make sense and would be a very useful feature. Spend (checking), Savings and Bills - if I had a separate account number for these three along with some cash back or rewards options on purchases, it would be the perfect banking app for me.

I have opened accounts with One, Envel, Discover, BBVA, PNC and CFCU and none come remotely close to offering the features Simple had, except Monzo USA. That said, the lack of access from a standard PC, except for the bare essential and feature limited (read nonexistent) emergency browser, is a major limiter and prevents me from using Monzo for all my finances as I was able to with Simple Bank. As such, I use Monzo daily while at the same time searching monthly for a replacement nenobank that has all the features Simple Bank offered before being shutdown.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-16T22:16:56-07:00

I‚Äôve been using Monzo for the past two months as my primary bank and not being able to use my budgeting app of choice is incredibly frustrating. What worse is that on Monzo‚Äôs development roadmap, Plaid support falls low on the list and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a priority at all. Granted, Monzo has built in budgeting tools, but they pale in comparison to something like Copilot. So while I‚Äôm not going to close my account, I will switch back to my credit union in the mean time.

There are NO international MasterCard fees and they give you a reasonable exchange rate. When you pay, choose ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù not the local currency and Monzo does the exchange. 

I love the fact it breaks down the purchases into categories. 

Also, Europe is notorious for ATM card skimming. By keeping a lower balance on my Monzo I limit my risk. I also use it instead of my regular bank card for cash withdrawals. 

I must say I like it and it‚Äôs practically the only card I use. Would love to see them do a Credit Card like Chime as you need a CC for many airlines and hotels
