**Update** they closed my account. I jumped through hoops just to have my account closed lol. Hopefully they don‚Äôt take months to give me my funds in my account.

The Pots have a ‚Äúscheduled payments‚Äù option, but it should really say ‚Äúscheduled transfers‚Äù because Pots are not for making payments - they are just to set money aside. To use money from Pots you have to transfer it back to main account.

6335181233,AnudariG,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id540538194,3.46.0,1,Awful service,They would not let me open an account when their app is not capable of uploading two images for identity verification for me to upload my passport photo page and extension on the second page. Due to this they could only see the expired date on my photo page and could not see the passport‚Äôs extension printed on the second page as my country only does extensions. I emailed them a scan of both pages and after telling me thanks for the copy of both pages and that it would not be a problem setting up my account spent 3 weeks being with no one helping to open my account with the emailed documentation as everything is done in app. In app customer service reps could not do anything and have sort of power whatsoever in resolving anything and could not open my account as they could probably only see the one image that is able to uploaded within the app. Horrible customer service and either the app needs full functionality or a website needs to be launched to avoid future problems. Found it most annoying that when I called they reassured me that I could definitely open an account with the emailed documents they received but actually did not and I still to this day cannot open an account with my valid identity verification document.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-18T15:00:00-07:00

Their latest response is:

‚ÄúHi Xxx, I'm so sorry for the delay here.
Are you all still having issues here? I don't believe this is something we have control over.‚Äù

Really?  It‚Äôs your app!  It‚Äôs not the brand new model iPhone with the latest iOS!

Anyway I‚Äôd highly recommend being careful at this point. Sadly. Because I was really fond of monzo",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-09T21:45:32-07:00
