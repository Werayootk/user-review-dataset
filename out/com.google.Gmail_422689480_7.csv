I received a developer response here on the apple store for my review which had absolutely nothing to do with my issue.  A link that had me check if I was connected to internet….are you kidding me?  Did you read my symptoms?    Multiple other people had posted reviews citing the same bug at the time.  Instead of testing for a bug or acknowledging it support was happy to waste my time with total nonsense that was clearly unrelated.
