The ‚Äúvegan‚Äú option in the user profile does nothing. The providers evidently never see it and are not bound in anyway to accommodate it. I‚Äôve found that I have to be careful to look over any store‚Äôs entire menu because if there‚Äôs anything on it that I wouldn‚Äôt eat it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to pay for something that I‚Äôm going to throw away anyway. ‚ÄúSaving a meal‚Äù should mean an actual meal.

But if I go into a vegan establishment expecting to pick up a ‚Äúmeal‚Äú and being told by the app that I‚Äôve just saved ‚Äúa meal‚Äúbut I get eight chocolate bars, that doesn‚Äôt work at all. One way to look at the upshot of all of this is that the app is for people who want to save a meal but who have the money to gamble on whether or not they will actually get some thing that will sustain them. I hate to think of someone who‚Äôs using the app because they actually need to save some money on food and they end up with chocolate bars. And another layer of aggravation is there‚Äôs one restaurant who I believe actually tries to put together amigo and does their best to avoid ingredients that might elicit an allergic response.
