I believe that thanks to ig ppl are connecting better and it breaking boundaries as a resourceful tool in networking. I loved when it first came out and it‚Äôs growing more n more. I have 2 business accounts and 1 personal and ig has helped me stay connected with ALL. I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about ig except to ad 1 tiny feature to the business accounts. Maybe possibly add a business feature where one can organize their following (not followers) list where they can categorize them. Example: influencers/vendors/photographers/ etc. 
I mean maybe it would help eliminate a lot of ghost accounts because I won‚Äôt lie... I‚Äôve made some just to keep up with what‚Äôs going on through my feed cause I also follow my customers as well as business influences. Ahhhh anyway. Hahahah that‚Äôs another thing. Thank you.

I actually have a great idea for Instagram and I think a majority of us with public accounts can agree; we need an option to prevent being added to a group chat of people who you don‚Äôt follow/they don‚Äôt follow us. I have been put in places with illegal immigrants adding me to group-chats and sending pornographic images of girls/men etc: I am 14, so this is a huge problem. I could get in a lot of trouble for possessing these images. I normally block everyone in the group-chat and leave and ignore the request. But it would be cool if you can make an option called ‚ÄúGroup Chat Request‚Äù where someone who doesn‚Äôt follow you and you don‚Äôt follow them cannot add you to a groupchat without a permission request. If you decline it, you cannot be in it. Or make it like Snapchat: If you don‚Äôt have them as a friend they cannot add you. Plus a lot of bot accounts and fake accounts make these groupchats to sell child porn/and or get you to tap a link that brings you to a porn site to see them live stream.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-21T07:53:49-07:00

Also, there are a plethora of robot accounts and spam accounts that are making the experience much less tolerable.

But Instagram would not let me post because they were 'protecting people with security guide lines.' Well for one, there was nothing wrong with what I said. And two, you'll block something I say when it's nowhere near bad but you won't even look or take down inappropriate posts? Honestly this needs to be upgraded and have an actual person look at these posts instead of a computer. I've also just recently reported THREE things for nudity and pornography.

You aren‚Äôt able to see ‚Äúrecent posts‚Äù in hashtags anymore as of the recent update, which was basically the only way for small creators to gain traction. The massive push for reels, the unstable and continuously and QUIETLY changing algorithm, etc‚Ä¶ small creators aren‚Äôt able to do jack anymore.

Post things you like and get with other people who like it. Can‚Äôt even do that anymore. The algorithm is now literally only supporting big creators. All small creators are entirely discouraged and left to their own devices to advertise their account on other apps, or not advertise at all.

Not completely take it away but where you could temporarily disable them and people won‚Äôt know the number of likes you got on your post.

You can only put one link in your bio and there are so many links to share to spread information and giving everyone the right to use the swipe up link option in stories would make it easier to share multiple links a day and make it easily accessible for people to support this very important moment on racial injustice and police brutality. Please fix this issue. This is basically a form of discrimination in itself that it is not available to everyone. You‚Äôre promoting the picture that you‚Äôre more worthy based off of follows, you‚Äôre promoting the picture that you‚Äôre social worth is based off of how many followers you have. So if we have less than 10k followers I am considered low class and not given the same equal opportunities as people that have more. Please fix this issue.

I think there should be an option to tell the creators of Instagram that there‚Äôs that kind of person on and I don‚Äôt want others under the influence that all of the previously mentioned things are okay. Because they‚Äôre not. 

I also think there should be an option to report a story post. This one person followed me, and (as always) I look at their posts and such. And this one person used an inappropriate name for colored people, and they said an inappropriate name for a private part.

I normally DM people that i don‚Äôt have in my regular contacts sometimes, DM is very useful so thanks for that! And in the reels sometimes I get ideas for stretching routines and ways to improve my body and dance moves. I also love how we can make accounts private because sometimes when I get follow requests none of my friends or people I‚Äôm following follow them so, I‚Äôm glad we can just delete the follow request since I‚Äôve never heard of them.

I reached out on a personal account and several small business owners told me that the exact same thing happened to them and Instagram never got back to them about recovering their account so they‚Äôve just had to start over. 
I began messaging Instagram 2 days ago and still have not heard back. They don‚Äôt have anyone that answers their number provided and no one seems to respond to the many emails I‚Äôve sent.

That was until the most recent update I‚Äôve seen across my page.
My explorer page and notifications page have been removed from my bottom bar, and replaced with reels and shopping. This might be quite literally the worst UI experience i‚Äôve ever has across any app at all. I spend 90% of my time on Instagram on my explorer, and think that my notifications should be easily accessible. Now they are completely out of the way and I had to spend a bit looking for their new location. Not to mention I am so in the habit of going directly to them via the bar that I keep accidentally finding myself in reels instead. I have never seen something so pointless in my life. Why replace two of the most popular and used features on Instagram with two features I never use. I don‚Äôt shop on Instagram, and I won‚Äôt be doing so anytime soon.

The combination of ads, suggested posts and reels have killed this app for me and many people I know.

Gone are the days of just checking in on your friends, family and favorite celebrities. Today, I scrolled through 12 suggested posts and 2 ads before I reached a single post from a page I actually follow and care about. I don‚Äôt want posts from pages I don‚Äôt follow.

Again, if I wanted that, I‚Äôd be on TikTok. 

I miss the Instagram of 10 years ago. The fun, friendly, minimal ad platform that it once was. Now it‚Äôs just a cesspool of negativity and ads, just like it‚Äôs parent company, Facebook, which I deleted off of my devices in 2020. Now, 3 years later, I‚Äôm pulling the plug on Instagram.

I noticed in lieu of gay pride month, Instagram created rainbow hashtags for any positive hashtag concerning the lgbqt+ community. Now I respect the lqbqt+ community and I have no ill-will against them... but this causes me to question your motives as a social media platform; because no other minority gets this sort of undying support. Why does it take a month about gay pride for you all to create a positive place for a minority? Where is this energy during black history month... why aren‚Äôt all positive hashtags regarding the African American community in Pan African pride colors? This to me, is a form of downright disrespect because how can you have such strong ties and beliefs to one Minority but not any other. I‚Äôm leaving this horrible review not only for my race, but for all races and minorities. You cannot call yourself a social platform welcoming to all when you are selective on whom you wish to represent. Gay people were not the only Minority that was put through years of terror from America, so why is it that they are the only ones being acknowledged. I don‚Äôt only blame Instagram because the same is for any social media site, but the hashtags brought to my attention how racism is still strong dividing force in America.

The app itself is great and perfect to use but the one thing I complain and dislike about it is the recent update. I have two accounts, one of them having the reel and shopping option at the bottom of the screen and the other post and likes. Unfortunately my other account has updated itself. I absolutely hate that the reels and shopping option is right there at the bottom. I wish that there‚Äôs an option that we could change how we want it, or update it back to the original because it‚Äôs so annoying. It was perfectly fine how it was but now, why change it?? There are some things that needed to be updated but never the layout on how it was before. PLEASE change it back, I can tell you that 95% of the instagram users hate how the bottom section is designed. PLEASE change it back.

If i wanted to watch reels or videos, i could just go to tiktok or the search option. That was the perfect place and i have no idea why you would ever change it",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-02T17:35:00-07:00

All of my buddies have received this update, but I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve made an effort to be patient and to fix the problem. I tried upgrading the app numerous times, restarting my phone, updating my phone, deleting the app, logging out of my account, and nothing worked. No option for music on my notes. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm being left out.I‚Äôm disappointed that Instagram would reject someone like this, and I‚Äôm upset altogether. Please provide me this update; I‚Äôd appreciate it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pleasant to be left out of your updates, and I have no idea why you choose to leave out someone like me. But it‚Äôs unfair, and I‚Äôd like to know about this development as soon as possible. I don‚Äôt deserve this update, so kindly give it to me. It‚Äôs quite disrespectful and disgusting of you to ignore me. I truly want this update, and I‚Äôm furious that you excluded me from it and all the other upgrades you‚Äôve done. I would really like to include music on my notes because I adore it. I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre picking on me in this way, but it has to stop.I‚Äôd love to add music to my notes, so please provide me this update.

8840333128,Gkjamcbes,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id471606328,241.1,1,The new layout horrible,"Instagram is slowly rolling out a new layout, I was unlucky enough to be forced into it. I call it the ‚Äúblack layout‚Äù because no matter what your phone color settings are on, the layout is black. The feed with this layout is absolutely horrible. It shows me one post of someone I follow and then the rest are random accounts I‚Äôve never seen before and it‚Äôs all videos that you can‚Äôt mute. The regular scrolling we are used to and that makes actual logical sense is gone, and it‚Äôs now this weird, choppy mess where nothing flows. Oh and captions now appear on the posts rather than below them, so if you‚Äôre a photographer and the entire photo is important to see, you might as well delete the app. I get it, insta is dying and trying to revive itself by becoming tik tok but instagram isnt tik tok and shouldn‚Äôt try to be. This new format is very obviously a horribly executed attempt to look like tik tok, but all it‚Äôs achieved is polarizing basically everyone who has ever used and liked instagram. It‚Äôs almost like the people at instagram said, how can we make the worst app update to ever exist, and make sure our audience deletes it? I‚Äôd say they exceeded those expectations. It‚Äôs unusable and I am deleting the app after having it since the beginning.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-04T10:25:12-07:00

They need to bring back showing us posts in order of when they were posted, not an order of who they think we want to see. They also need to stop censoring. I want to see every post from everyone and following, not just ones you think I‚Äôm interested in. Also, stop trying to make this the shop for people. We don‚Äôt want to buy things on Instagram, we want to connect with our friends and family. The new update makes it really hard to post a photo or see who liked and commented, but really easy to go to the explorer page and go to the shopping page. Stop trying to make a huge profit and just let us enjoy this app. If there is one update that they should add, let us delete a single photo on a multi photo post. Sometimes I post one post with three photos at a time and then realize one of those photos needs to be taken off. I would have to delete the entire post and I‚Äôm not reposting something once all my friends have seen it. If I was able to delete or cover up one of those pictures that would be amazing.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-18T23:31:23-07:00
7060660604,Carolinewriter,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id239569395,177.0,1,Imagine tobacco in time of social media,"Imagine how tobacco would have acted when accused of causing cancer and other issues in the time of Instagram etc. Cig makers would have spent millions on fake studies showing that lung cancer caused by smoking was a coincidence  (they did) and persuaded social media to block people‚Äôs personal stories and researchers not paid by them. They would have paid off Drs to defend cigs (they did) and silenced everyone. 
If it were in the time of social media even if your Dad died of second hand smoke and you could prove it the act of posting this would have caused you to be blocked with no way to defend yourself. This important signal would be lost  I understand the need to warn against certain messages but it you are going to block people you need to give them a way to defend themselves with science and with proof . Imagine how many women could have been saved if the once  disputed link between talc and ovarian cancer had been discovered decades ago . We are silencing a powerful signals by taking industry, Pharma; corporatize narratives as the only truth. You can fix this by having a clear and rigorous way for those who disagree with your findings to prove their point. Lookup thalidomide. Lookup up the history of lead in gas and lead in paint.

So to start off before any update took place, whether it was the new iPhone update or if Instagram updated, everything was working just fine. Now I‚Äôm experiencing mass amounts of glitches starting off with my DMs. There will be times I receive a DM and once I get onto the app and tap to get to the DMs the screen is all black. I can go back onto my feed and insta-story camera but the entire DM page is black. A second glitch that has also been occurring and is still occurring is false notifications on my other accounts. I have three accounts linked to my Instagram and each one gets notifications regularly and I check each one. But just as I had checked them, it still shows as if the notification had never been checked. The notifications range from likes, comments, and DMs do idrk whats up with that. I have a feeling it may be the newest IOS update but even if it is, there should be something that can fix this because I keep having to exit out of the app and entering in again. That only solves the DM glitch but the false notification glitch won‚Äôt go away.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people having this problem for no reason so it seems like it‚Äôs something that should be looked into, however nothing has changed for me. Many accounts are apparently being ‚Äúshadow-banned‚Äù, but get are back to normal in about a week. I, however, haven‚Äôt been able to do any of the things mentioned above in three months. I‚Äôve sent in reports in settings, I‚Äôve tried staying off the app for a week, and then deleting the app entirely for a week in hopes that the lack of activity would return my account back to normal just to find that nothing has changed. I hope a developer can assist me in getting the app back, but currently the app is useless, and seeing that no one has helped this far into the issue, I simply would not recommend this app to anyone based solely off of their lack of acknowledgement to my problem. I understand I am one user of many, but if they truly cared about their users they would help. Until then, I will be taking it upon myself to download tiktok and spend my time there instead of the long lengths of time I used to spend on this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-11T22:17:37-07:00
