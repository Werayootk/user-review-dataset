There are some pros and cons to it. One pro could be the fact that you could find basically anything on the app. One huge con is the games that have to be played to get free items. With every single game that you have to play, it starts off quick and easy but once you‚Äôre near the end to get your free items, it suddenly becomes impossible. Of course everybody enjoys the sound of free stuff but with how extended the games are, it doesn‚Äôt make it worth it. When you‚Äôre allowed to choose a few free items, but then you have to constantly share a link to everybody you possibly can, it‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs not exactly easy if you don‚Äôt have enough people to share the link with.

A short article by Grizzly Research found out that ‚ÄúTemu was also found to contain hidden malware that was intentionally hid from the Temu‚Äôs files.‚Äù Which would allow access to almost all data for anyone who downloaded the app. For every order Temu sells they are losing $30, but the catch is they sell your information to keep up with the debt which is highly illegal, but communists dont care. And the same software engineers that built Pinduoduo, built Temu. Also you see ads for Temu stating that you can get free stuff, its most likely true but the catch is that its to get the most amount of people to download the app. Thank you.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-18T22:20:34-07:00"},{"id":"10542467690","userName":"Cndjsoxkdkdkd","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1510634010","version":"2.16.0","score":5,"title":"Games are not okay","text":"The game farm land or the fish game or any of the other games are just a scam to get you to promote them for free with little to no benefit for yourself the app itself will make you buy a minimum of 10 dollars to check out , liked it at first but now it‚Äôs just shameful realizing that it‚Äôs just a different version of shien and some the stuff is legit but if you want to just get one or two things you can‚Äôt .

Each order brings more fabulous items. The prices are amazing. The last ordered I received I just laughed and was so happy looking through all my things. I was hesitant because of the whole mess with the wish app so I was careful only to use my PayPal but this company is truly trustworthy. I wanted to return shoes that were too small. They refunded me my money and told me to donate the shoes. How awesome is that? Now I have the correct sizes for my daughter and a child less fortunate then us has 3 new pairs of shoes. I love this app. My husband maybe not so much cause I‚Äôm addicted lol just joking. It‚Äôs so cheap he doesn‚Äôt even notice the small dent in our account.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-19T13:44:11-07:00"}]
