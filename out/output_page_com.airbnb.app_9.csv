I just started hosting and am surprised how well the app works in hosting mode! My one piece of feedback has to do with the messages. I think it would be a nice feature to have some visual indication in the app that the user has unread messages without going to the messages screen. Perhaps when there are unread messages, the icon could have lines in it? I get a notification icon on the app badge, then it always takes me awhile tapping around the app to figure out what it is I’m being notified of. Most of the time it’s a new message, but there’s nothing in the app that leads me to that conclusion.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-01T09:04:08-07:00

Every time I save a place Airbnb auto-generates a new list. It won’t use the last list and I have to double check every single move I make now.

I can guess why you’d create smart lists and may result in metrics bumps in aggregate as you push people into suggestions- but they’re not smart at all. 

It’s worse on desktop. There were so many auto lists I couldn’t find my list for an earlier leg of a trip because of an almost invisible ‘see all’ button hiding behind a sea of lists I did not create myself.

In areas where they offer airbnb plus they no longer show my kind of hosts - close to real life - but only show the 5-star locations. I’m not interested in that! If i was, i would go to a 5-star resort!

Second issue: airbnb asks host to point at their house on the map - so the exact location is stored in their system. Yet, they refuse to use that data and instead go by address. That works in the US, but not in Central America, India, or other countries where street addresses are not used. There you end up in totally wrong places, even dangerous situations!
To me, this is a serious flaw; one that is very easy to fix for them. Yet, they don’t want to for years now!!! 😡
Every booking it is always a problem getting the exact location and finding the place. Always have to fight the system to get to contact host through whatsapp and get exact location from them that way.

We had gotten fed up with each other after the messages grew hostile, and I asked him to refund me so I could find something else if he couldn’t accommodate. He refused and begrudgingly told me he’d meet me when I asked. 

After this I gave him a nice review because the room was nice and he accommodated, but he left a nasty review of me as a guest AND responded to my review to further let out his anger about changing his schedule for me. 

As the guest, you have no option to respond to reviews like the host does. Also, Airbnb does not tell you this, but if a host gives you a “thumbs down” as a rating you are no longer able to instantly book rooms.

This was a totally petty fight, and in the grand scheme of things reviews don’t matter much, but the experience was annoying and ruined my mood for the start and end of my vacation, and I wasn’t able to do anything about it because I decided to leave a nice review.

I use both an iPhone 12 Pro and a Google Pixel 6. On both devices Airbnb regularly (every day) fails to update its “today” page with relevant notifications, messages, and updates.

Navigation on the Pixel disappears every other time I use the app and I have to force close it and reopen in order to navigate again (move between a reservation detail page and my inbox, for example).

The one innovation Airbnb brought to the market is double-blind ratings with identity verification. This creates a market where there was none before. However, Airbnb has failed to provide any new subsequent innovation, leaving the entire community vulnerable to the company’s monopoly power over room rentals around the world.

Hosts are not permitted to cancel a reservation without asking for permission from Airbnb first. There is an ominous warning that they can claw back money in your account and ruin your ratings just for canceling a booking for any reason.

The host is very hospitable, and explain all the amenities in details to the guests. 
The only thing that I will suggest is to put a clothes hook on the back of the toilet door so that we can hang our clothes while showering.
It will also be nice if the host provide a towel floor mat to be placed in front of the shower room since it is only partially closed ( no door) ; therefore, the water will splash out while we are bathing. 

The other thing that can be improved is the availability of more trash cans in the unit since the building has no garbage bin room on its floor, we find it troublesome as to where to throw the trash. 

Other than that, our stay is awesome.  Except for those of you who drive a car, you should be willing to pay an extra paid parking in the premise which cost you RM 2/ hour, except on weekend they have a maximum charge of RM 10/day.

The first time, I was told they’d look into it. Nothing happened. 

This time, I was told that it is normal and lots of users have to deal with it, and that there was nothing to be done to fix it. He suggested I write a review about it, and told me the design team checks these periodically. So…

This is indisputably Anti-Semitic because there is a very long list of disputed lands around the globe, a lot of which are involved in horrific mistreatment of others that are still being rented from. Airbnb did not ban homes in Turkish occupied Cyprus, Moroccan occupied Sahara, China occupied Tibet, or Russia Occupied South Ossetia. This is completely unacceptable. They have been weak and have caved to an extremely anti- Semitic and horrifically biased anti-semitic movement, and by anti semitic, I mean Anti Jewish. Disgusting!

 If Airbnb decides to be reasonable and change their mind about this, I will take down this review. If it is still up, it means that they haven’t. 

Airbnb, you messed with the wrong crew. And if you want to be on the right side of history, you better change your policy soon, before you go completely out of business.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2018-11-24T05:54:21-07:00
