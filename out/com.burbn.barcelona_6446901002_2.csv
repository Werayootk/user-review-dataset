There’s still very much hatred, racism, sexism, and stochastic terrorism being promoted pretty well unchecked as the report option is still limited to meta enforcement. The app itself is more enjoyable than Facebook and instagram but Zuckerberg has allotted all of his resources here and it’s still mediocre at best in terms of keeping the bad off of the app. This is probably the best social media app today, and it’s still owned and operated by meta so take that for what it is. Certain topics will be surpressed like the Gaza situation and it often times seems like it’s surpressed in the wrong direction and allows hatred to flourish unhampered.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-26T12:00:55-07:00

While there are definitely alternatives that are better and get updated more regularly Threads has more than enough content to get you through a small scrolling session.
