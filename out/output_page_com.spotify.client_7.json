Firstly the queue system does not work. When reordering songs in the queue by dragging, they will flicker and the page refuses to scroll, making it very hard to reorder them. Sometimes the app even crashes when I try to do this. Also, the shuffle system is extremely flawed, as often times in a playlist songs by the same artist will play one after another, or conversely songs organized chronologically in a playlist will shuffle slightly but will gradually advance in time. For example, I have a chronological playlist by a single artist and the songs will usually shuffle by playing the oldest songs first and then gradually getting to the new ones, while still shuffling slightly between the songs.

And by that I mean I have alot of songs together or even just all my liked songs and it happens to be choosing the same songs every time. If there was a way to make sure it chooses a different song every time I click the shuffle it would be amazing. For example I have around 2k songs that I‚Äôve liked and it‚Äôs not every single song I know, but even from that it happens to play the same ones I‚Äôve heard before repeatedly while other songs that I have there aren‚Äôt played. That would just be great to do but other than that.

I love the playlists, availability of my favorite artists, and listening across multiple platforms. The app falls short currently in three places for me. Where I live is rural - No cell service, bad wifi. I keep some music and a few episodes of podcasts downloaded so I can listen between home and the glorious land of data, but one of the more recent updates makes downloads not register sometimes. It spins and says I have no internet connection and never shows my downloads. Force quitting the app works 70% of the time, but normally I will have made it to cell service by the time it comes back. \n\nWhen trying to binge my favorite podcasts from the beginning to catch up to real time, the app trys to always throw me to the newest one (or episode 0). When trying to go from phone to windows client, listen history is so messed up that I have to use the play progression bars to figure out which one I'm actually on.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-04-06T17:07:49-07:00"},{"id":"8852176966","userName":"denisdailyfanalldayeveryday","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id967307715","version":"8.7.46","score":1,"title":"Its kinda stupid now after the free trial","text":"So they gave me a 14 day free trial and I did not know that but when it ran out I was like oh ok I‚Äôm still able to click on a song and listen to it no problem. Well, no. Cuz once the free trial ran out to listen to the full song, the playlist would be on shuffle and you would have to wait till the song came on. And when you clicked on the song, it would play like 6 seconds of it and then would stop playing that. Also once the free trial ran out you got to skip 6 songs per hour. And the app says well you can just upgrade to premium and so you are like alright I‚Äôll get premium and then be able to click on a song and listen to it right there and then. No. It legit says that it does not support premium on the app. I‚Äôm my opinion if it can‚Äôt support it then why put all these premium features? Why not just make it where those are already built in and you don‚Äôt have to worry about it but no. Anyways that‚Äôs my review. I hope y‚Äôall see this and edit y‚Äôall‚Äôs app cuz right now, it‚Äôs trash","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-07T23:03:35-07:00"},{"id":"8471254375","userName":"638291037","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1271213908","version":"8.7.14","score":2,"title":"Multiple Issues","text":"This app has a few quality features that make it very nice but a few issues with some basic functions that I just can not over look. To start with pros it should be noted that many many people use this app so there are many songs put out by people that you can not find on other music apps. Plus you can find many varieties of playlists which is great! The cons that I can not ignore is how poorly I have found the workings of their playlist functions to be. I can not add new playlists on my phone or laptop nor can I delete or edit them. It says I have deleted something but it never goes away. So it is very irritating in that way which could be ignored if it were not such a basic feature. The other issue is I have tried reaching out about the issue but have found myself waiting for a response for quite some time. All in all it is a fine app but due to its failures with playlists I‚Äôll have to opt for Apple Music instead.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-18T22:39:25-07:00"},{"id":"8225876014","userName":"Idk Reviewer","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id939348396","version":"8.6.94","score":1,"title":"Apart from numerous glitches/bugs, still the app that I‚Äôd pick","text":"I‚Äôd give you 5 stars if there went so many glitches. I do like the app, I use it nearly everyday, but the bugs on here make it annoying to use. \n\n#1 problem: The app will sometimes refresh randomly while I‚Äôm using it. My music stops and when I open the app, my playlist has stopped. It either closes the playlist completely, or pauses it, which gets frustrating.\n\n#2 problem: I added a song to my queue once and then my app did the refresh thing, and now there‚Äôs an empty space between the song currently playing and the ‚ÄúNext From: [playlist name]‚Äù and it won‚Äôt go away. Now the top bar and stuff on the app are always pushed up. (I have the iPhone 13 and it goes under my camera bar) I tried everything apart from uninstalling the app. It‚Äôs not really a big problem, but it‚Äôs annoying to me.\n\n#3 problem: Sometimes my app does this glitch with the lyrics when I go into the app after entering another app. When it goes to another song, it‚Äôll have the lyrics from the other song still there, unmoving. It‚Äôll have the lyrics from one song stuck in the lyrics box until I close the app out. I notice the scroll for my playlist name also stops when this happens. \n\nI can‚Äôt think of anything else, so that‚Äôs about it.\n\nI give the app a 6/10, 3 stars until these glitches are fixed. Since I‚Äôm not a verified artist on Twitter and just some lowly customer, you probably won‚Äôt read this. Please fix your app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-10T09:19:27-07:00"},{"id":"6454460432","userName":"John R Dequindre","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id323760447","version":"8.5.76","score":2,"title":"This app is truly an embarrassment","text":"Slick, intuitive design. That‚Äôs it. Every time I see an update for this app in the App Store I get excited that it‚Äôs myriad issues will finally be resolved and every time I‚Äôm let down. The app is so unstable. When the ads try to come up half the time the app just stops. Or the buttons stop working. Or the song looks like it‚Äôs playing, buy no sound. Or literally ceases functioning. Sometimes I have to reboot my phone to zap it back to life. I‚Äôve had this app for over a year now and it seems more unstable then ever. How can this be? How can a software company with this much money and this much ‚Äòcool‚Äô be so terrible at software design for iPhones. I just don‚Äôt get it. On top of that they want me to pay them monthly to upgrade to premium! No way. I feel bad for their advertisers that are paying them to have their ads not get played b/c the app constantly craps the bed. I only write this b/c I believe these messages can lead to better design. So stop posting 4.8 stars people.

Practically every time I leave the app open and try to come back to it -- even within the refresh rate window -- it freezes and I have to force reset it. But that's not the kicker; the kicker is that the app is too stupid to realize it's closed so it starts playing the music it wouldn't let you play before you tried to shut it down. I am consistently frustrated by how ridiculous this thing is. Practically every major developer we rely on at this point just keeps cramming features in without optimizing anything, and while there's been some effort on Spotify's part to make it serious, it still handles like a crappy little plaything on a toy of an operating system. Oh yeah and I'd like it if I could keep my music forever please? And not have to wait for the New Depression to lose it when this company finally runs out of finance capital?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-04-12T05:15:31-07:00"}]
