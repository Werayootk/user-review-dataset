My only issue is that the app feels a little bare-bones as of now. I understand it‚Äôs brand new and will be in the process of developing itself over time, but I‚Äôd love to see a bit more in terms of interface. The app feels a bit empty without a proper tagging system and it‚Äôs extremely hard for me to find new content and users to follow because my feed is mostly people I already follow on Instagram (plus random verified accounts and one or two new creators I find interest in). Please consider implementing a hashtag or keyword function for the Search bar (or maybe even an Explore page), and I‚Äôd probably find a lot more interest in the app!

Overall, this is a pretty decent start and I‚Äôm interested to see where it goes next‚Ä¶ and to have a place to post my 3 AM intrusive thoughts.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T07:36:02-07:00

So far I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic, but it does bother me that it‚Äôs owned by Facebook/Instagram and the app is very minimal at the start. So we‚Äôll see how it goes.

My wife and I both downloaded Threads within 24 hours of each other. I‚Äôve had a positive experience with it so far, but for some reason her account showed her some very questionable stuff (three posts in around thirty seconds of scrolling). I‚Äôm guessing this is because I follow more accounts so I don‚Äôt see posts from unfollowed accounts, but it could also be due to Instagram privacy/security settings since many of those sync over.

My main concern at this point is with content visibility control. When someone I follow replies to someone I don‚Äôt, I should see a button to show the original post and not the full post by default. There should not be random posts on the feed, especially when they highlight risqu√© photos. Some people may like seeing unrelated posts, but there needs to be a simple control for seeing this or not. As it stands, my wife has deactivated her account already (less than ten minutes of use) and I may be following suit rather shortly. I understand it‚Äôs very new still, but this is important and needs to be addressed promptly for the sake of users and the platform.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T14:59:25-07:00

What once was a convenient way to connect with friends has boiled down to a very toxic and potent problem. I feel this disease crosses all platforms; along with that I also should mention that on a political scale I fall mostly in the middle. Maybe slightly more conservative but certainly am not a big supporter of trump or Biden for that matter. All this considering- Threads seems like a open slap back at Twitter for its embracement of open and often controversial speech‚Ä¶ I had the app for a few weeks and honest to God loathed every second, the app worked fine functionally but the content was terrible and exhausting. It was an echo chamber of random people‚Äôs frustration and misinformed opinions, most being very far left wing. I get there are algorithms in what a person is shown but on all other related platforms (instagram, facebook) I do not follow any left wing news outlet. None. But every time- and I mean. EVERY TIME. I see suggestions on instagram for threads or am just on threads. It is the first and almost always the only thing I see is far left wing influencers basking in negativity and ignorant rants. 

It just seems a bit ‚Äúbias‚Äù is all I am saying. It seems like there was a different goal in the creation of this platform and ‚Äúcreating a friendly space‚Äù is not it.

The app in itself is poorly made, they made it so simple that it ended up not being user friendly. Forcing you to connect it to an instagram, keeping the same username,(some people enjoy privacy!), and impersonal timelines that are filled with unfunny verified accounts that are impossible to get rid of no matter how many you mute. You can‚Äôt even follow enough accounts you like to keep the stuff you don‚Äôt like off your timeline. Tried deactivating my threads account, not only will it not fully deactivate but you can‚Äôt remove the badge on your instagram no matter what you do, even though it tells you that you can. It just pops back up every time you restart the app or change tabs. I feel like i‚Äôm being forced to participate in something I no longer want to be a part of. This is such a terrible app I can barely put it into words. And to think that verified accounts had it before me and it still has all these issues is shocking. Very disappointing.

Check other critical reviews, all valide points. Will it improve before daily user count falls off a cliff? 50/50. My bet is Meta will eventually throw in the towel as you never get a second chance at first impressions. The daily user count is rapidly trending downward in close proximity to introduction when it should be climbing upwards toward critical mass. Not a death knell, but a leading indicator of judgement by users. Meta should be increasing daily user count at this point, moving the needle in a positive direction. If there isn‚Äôt a community of sufficient size to not just maintain but grow daily users there will not be momentum to sustain it. You can either ‚ÄúGrow or Die‚Äù.

My account states it is in good standing and adheres to community standards. I have been told I might have replied too often or to to many people in a given time. I have been a threads user since day 1, and have never received a ban, and my use has been consistent. So I must ask, what is the point of a social media if I can‚Äôt reply to my friends on the content I post? Why are there no listed metrics by which we can adhere to? Having no guidance as to post/like/comment limits makes no sense if there is such a steep penalty (I have a 7 day ban). Im banned for a week for using the app as it was designed, and no response from threads or meta. I also notice that many of the reports I have made against anti-trans hate speech are unresolved for over a month.

the separate page should be our home page with news, pop culture events, hashtags you follow, and the random users/suggested posts here
pls give us hashtags!
search by hashtags and words, not just users 
thumbs down for threads (dislike count not shown public)
pls give us a gif library in the threads post area
a drafts/save for later tab for threads
following count put by the follower count too. why is it just one? show both or neither, pls pick one
show list of likes + the option to keep it private
saved/bookmarks tab (private)
dms/private messages on here

10124690710,BeRad_NZ,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id406848493,289,1,Clunky and lame,"I recently tried out this app, and let me tell you, it was a total letdown. Right from the start, the user interface was a mess. I mean, seriously, what were they thinking? It was confusing and just plain ugly. It felt like they randomly threw everything together without any thought for user experience. I was left scratching my head, trying to figure out where everything was.

But that's not all. The app had serious performance issues. It was as slow as a snail on a Sunday stroll. Every tap felt like an eternity, and don't even get me started on the freezing! I'd be in the middle of doing something, and bam! The app would freeze, leaving me frustrated and annoyed.

And here's the real kicker: Threads had this crazy, over-the-top censorship going on. They didn't want anyone to say anything remotely controversial or express any dissenting opinions. Come on! We should be able to have open conversations without being muzzled. It felt like they were trying to control what we could and couldn't say, and that's just plain wrong.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend Threads to anyone. The terrible user interface, performance issues, and heavy-handed censorship make it a complete waste of time. If you're looking for an app that values free speech and actually works well, keep on searching, my friend. Threads is definitely not the one for you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-10T07:08:57-07:00

10122579004,saraSweater,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id999955395,289,1,There‚Äôs potential,"No point in getting this app if you want to use it to keep in touch with mutuals. You will not see who you follow on your feed, even if you change the settings to see so you follow first. You only get to see for posts at most by who you follow, after that, you just get recommended accounts who are verified and only post twitter screenshots. I hate twitter so only seeing twitters negativity is really disappointing. 

Even if you‚Äôre content just seeing certain mutuals, if you accidentally refresh the app, you‚Äôll never find whatever posts you were looking at, posted by your following, ever again. Your best bet to see all of who you follow Is to individually check all of their profiles daily. Who has time for that though? Might as well just take following people on the app off. Really disappointing for small creators. Not even upset for myself, just want to support my friends. Genuinely impossible. 

Another thing, pictures upload in  bad quality just line Instagram. 5 second videos take 5 minutes to upload. You have to click on the video and full screen it if you want to listen to it, with Instagram, don‚Äôt even have to click the video. You just turn up your volume and that‚Äôs why I love instagrams. 

Praying they fix that following feed issue or it‚Äôll be the apps biggest downfall tbh.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-09T16:37:14-07:00
