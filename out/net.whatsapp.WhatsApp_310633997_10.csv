Color. Why can‚Äôt we change the color of the messages? Why can‚Äôt we change the color theme of WhatsApp? Why can‚Äôt there be an option to make messages look more ‚Äútransparent‚Äù to sort of blend-in to the wallpaper, like tabs do on MacOS? 

Video quality. The video call quality has unfortunately always been a problem for me. When I switch to FaceTime, the call with the same person, same time, and same place works so much quicker, there is no lag, and the audio and video are great. I wish WhatsApp were like this. 

üòä I will say that I am a big fan of the stickers and ‚Äúabout‚Äù status on profiles. The messaging works seamlessly and quickly.

I understand that you are trying to avoid spam, but you are punishing good people also. If you need to reduce the spam why don't  reduce from 20 people to 10 because 5 is truly very restrictive.
Also why it can't be installed on iPad and tablets ? If you want to make people happy let people install it and use it wherever they want. Maybe someone without a smart phone but with and old wired telephone can use its number and install whatsapp in a computer, iPod or tablet.
I know that it's ""free"" for the users,  but you know the agreement you have with Cel companies that always are offering your service and also facebook, like part of theirs.
