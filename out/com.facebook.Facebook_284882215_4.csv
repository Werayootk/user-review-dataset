But there are impersonators sending me friend requests nearly every day, and Facebook has no good way of preventing this or even solving it.  So my family members and older friends are impersonated generally for weeks while the impersonators are stealing personal information from the people that “fell for it.”  Soon these people will be the next to be impersonated.  This is a screwed up system where a lot of people are being used! Money is sometimes involved as well, because people fall in love with these impersonators sometimes and then they ask for money (happened to a friend!) They are very sly.  Just know that Facebook does absolutely no checking whatsoever as to who people are when they sign up, so criminals just have a field day on here.  I have to give it all these stars because I love seeing my actual friends’ pictures, but truly this is a major problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-21T07:16:01-07:00

I say, be wary facebook- the house of cards will eventually fall if you do not take head to the fraudulent accounts that have been stolen/ hacked/ reported.

Throughout the lifetime of the item being for sale I’d say 85% of the questions I get are from scammers! I’ve reported all of these accounts but it doesn’t stop.

This happened because someone hacked into my Facebook account and posted stuff that ultimately got it banned. I couldn’t even explain to Facebook that it wasn’t me and it was someone else, who hacked me, that posted those. I was so mad because I lost memories and photos I can’t get back now. I eventually made a new email and new account a few days later. I was able to use that account for TWO days before it was disabled again for going against community guidelines. I haven’t even posted anything on this new account, or shared anything! How can I go against the guidelines without posting or sharing! Facebook used to be a great app but they don’t care about you or your account. They have no customer support to be able to fix issues, you have to jump through useless hoops and can’t even talk to a real person. If my account gets banned again from doing absolutely nothing then I will not be making a new account, which is a real bummer for me since I love using marketplace and seeing post from my family and friends. Do better Facebook!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-12T08:13:36-07:00

I had a lot of fun in the beginning when you could build private groups and post anything . That was before the nudity and violence algorithms took over . I miss the r.i.p. groups . I said ok let’s get serious , I administered several groups with tens of thousands of members and we started getting pressured about hunting photos showing guns and hunted animals . I fought to keep them posted in the group for years . Hunting is a way of life for most people who live outside a city . I gave up after a few years and completely sterilized my profile , deleted all my friends and left all the groups , I only followed pages after that and used market place and messenger . During the capital riots I was immediately put on a 24 hour ban because a person reported me for bullying because I disagreed with them . I tried to get a review and they still wouldn’t lift it . It was time to fully leave the app , it used to be fun to joke and carry on but these last four years has been horrible . I will be fine and maybe this app will return to being fun and people can be ok being themselves again .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-21T21:28:30-07:00

My main issue is that I have the latest iPadOS and this app consistently breaks the ability to swipe. I’m not sure how it manages it, but this app is the only one that causes this issue, and it’s very repeatable. Scroll down through your feed, which is ad, ad, ad, real post, ad, ad, ad, hate and lies, ad, ad, ad, ad, ad… Then when you want to get back to the top, tap the top of your screen and watch as you can no longer use swipe gestures. Awesome. Can’t scroll in the app, can’t get out of the app, and after holding the power and volume down buttons to bring up the controls to shut down, I couldn’t swipe on the thing to make it shut down. I’m just glad I have a Magic Keyboard so that I can use the trackpad to get out of the app, then force quit it, which fixes all the problems. As long as I force quit Facebook after every use, my device works fine, and no other app causes these problems.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-19T13:15:05-07:00

There is no way you get anyone to communicate with you so you can argue your case, despite the facade of ""giving you options"". I am an admin  a community group and was unable to communicate with its members just because I had suspension on my other group!

In the mean time, Zuck has spent tens of $millions helping destroy our election system...and WHILE half naked busty girls photos in provocative and suggestive poses are all over everyone's feed, even children's feed; cats galore and degrading videos flourish on FB.

It’s now been 3 weeks that this has been going on for me and I’m sure other people are having the same issues. When you go to the 3 bars on the Facebook app usually the dating button is there but it hasn’t been there for 3 weeks now. Saying it’s unavailable. I had a profile on there and all of a sudden my profile and the dating button just disappeared and is not showing up. I have done every tutorial I have come across and I have reset my phone, turned it off dozens of times, I’ve deleted the Facebook app multiple times and reinstalled Facebook app and still nothing. Today I just did another update on Facebook app and still no dating app, so what is going on and when is Facebook going to fix this issues that has been clearly going on for many people for weeks or probably months for some. Someone at Facebook needs to say something to the people or fix the issue as soon as possible. This is going on for too long and shouldn’t be going on any longer. Fix the issues Facebook!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-13T12:02:49-07:00

And, it crashes all the time. I switched from the Home tab that had ads and posts in non-chronological order to the Recent tab, which had posts appear in the order they were shared, and no ads. After a day or two of ad-free peace, the algorithm made in the bowels of evil started posting nonstop ads on the Recent tab as well. Every time I want to hide an ad, a pop-up appears asking why I want to hide it. Because it’s irrelevant, useless trash. Who cares why, just hide the ad. It’s overall a toxic and foul environment with an annoying interface. (Instagram is the same.) I was keeping this stupid thing on my phone for the sake of getting family updates but it isn’t even worth it. If I could convince my all relatives on this app to form a mass exodus from this pestilential pile of rat carcasses, I would. And forget about getting access to your account if you forget your password. I want to delete my account but forgot my password. When I tried to reset it, the app locked me out and is asking me to upload my passport or driver’s license, which is super invasive nonsense.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-18T09:41:33-07:00

Never once did I have any issues reporting people back then. I’m now 21 years old. I legit had a 16 year old dude try to sleep with me not only that try to convince me to send him nudes when I told him NO. That’s absolutely disgusting and not okay. So I decided to post him on my towns local site as a warning to make sure everyone knows not to mess with this dude because he is trouble and trying to get others in trouble. My account got BANNED for 30 days because I exposed him!!!! I was told by Facebook it was bullying??? How is exposing some 16 year old creep, bullying?? I tried to fight this case at the Oversight Board but they denied it as well to even give me my Facebook back sooner. Be careful when on this site. Facebook doesn’t care about its users nor care about safety. You will also see lots of scammer posts and there is NO category to even report them in. Facebook WILL NOT take them down! Kiss this app goodbye if youve been using it for years. You’re better off going to MEWE, an alternative of Facebook. You get freedom of speech there and even the right to report the ACTUAL stuff that should be taken down along with another person.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-05T14:41:34-07:00
