So therefore since telegram doesn’t provide a video group chat option we have to download another application to be able to do that Task.

It is apparent that the introduction of the premium subscription has shifted the focus towards pushing users into purchasing it, leading to an unfortunate degradation of the basic functionalities. Notably, the severe limitation placed on sending messages, even when used responsibly, is particularly concerning. As an illustration, I found myself unable to communicate effectively within work-related groups, where I was seeking job opportunities. The necessity to compose messages daily, amidst the flood of communication, to ensure visibility for potential employers is both impractical and counterproductive.\n\nDespite multiple attempts to address this issue through support inquiries, the lack of response is disheartening. Instead, I received a notification suggesting that the solution lies in acquiring a premium subscription – specifically, to regain the ability to send messages. This approach appears illogical and far from user-friendly. While I am inclined to assign a zero-star rating to reflect my discontent accurately, unfortunately, this option isn't available. I remain hopeful that a more competent alternative emerges in the near future, drawing users away from this application.

They have to make their money back from all that they put in. Everything is quality including the stickers!!!! I absolutely love them!!! They only thing I’d add is fonts , (so I don’t have to use other apps to copy & paste them in) & it would be nice if they could ban screen recording as well.  \n\nMoral of the story: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10 stars ✨ hands down.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-02T04:54:10-07:00"},{"id":"9387157094","userName":"Doctor dolapo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1467500327","version":"9.2","score":1,"title":"Good app. But turn to bad app now","text":"I’ve been using my telegram account for more than 5 years ago and Telgram are banning people account without warning.

I am a recovering stroke victim, so I haven’t been able to work in almost 6 years, but recently decided to take a leap and find a remote job, as I can’t drive at the moment.\nThis afternoon I received an email, in regards to a job I applied to.  I quickly forwarded to onto my husband and he pointed out right away that it was sent from someone with a “Gmail” address and not a company email, which was the first red flag.  It goes onto say I would be interviewing with this guy and said the virtual interview would take place at this platform.  Ok, I have never heard of such place.  The like had his name spelled without an “s”, which I found to be another Red Flag.\nMy husband texted me back a screenshot of a scam done on behalf of this company (using this company name) and on this platform.\nI tried reporting this persons account, but was unsuccessful, as apparently this platform is run by volunteers.\nI just want to see this persons account shut down.  I tried searching this person on LinkedIn and couldn’t find any matches.  I tried searching without the “s” and still no searches.\nI contacted the company and the lady told me they are not hiring for remote jobs, only on-site and apologized.  She said no one by the names I gave her worked for the company.\nI immediately deleted this app and will be more careful in the near further.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-20T14:19:04-07:00"},{"id":"7552897979","userName":"Pesare Shojae","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id567225351","version":"7.8.2","score":3,"title":"Need imediate help","text":"Hi telegram is one of the best communication apps out there but the ownership of channels and groups is a pain in the neck really, i have bought a channel from an admin and she claimed that she owns the channel i had no idea about owner stuff and that you can transfer the ownership of channels until it was late, she by mistake made someone admin with her other account just when i thought she had left the channel with her both accounts when i demanded an answer she refused stubbornly to do so, so i did a research and found out that iam just an admin despite paying huge amount of cash and now she refuses to co operate but can get back at any time and kick me from moy own chhannel i wrote to telegram support saying i have all the vidence that i paid money to this guy and chat records are there too but they didnt answered back 😞😔 it seems that there is no hope for me...","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-08T04:35:26-07:00"},{"id":"10158189335","userName":"pajhdlh","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id654357663","version":"9.6.3","score":1,"title":"Suggest to make recovery or deactivate the account more in time!","text":"Though Telegram is ease to use, the system didn’t remind or force to link the recovery email or phone while users sign-up / login in. This make this application easily to hack by someone. Today my tele account get hack and I can’t recover or deactivate my account in-time. This make the hackers have more time to access my contact list and make a free chat with my friends for SWINDLE and try to hack their accounts.\nIt’s my negligence make this case. But for others applications the recovery process is much easier than Telegram. Hope developer get serious on this security problems and make new users taking more awareness on linking recovery email or phone… Make a  user tips guidances or something for new users please .

I absolutely loathe apps that don’t respect my notifications preferences and this one in particular doesn’t like to suppress the very annoying ones that come in every single time someone in my contacts list joins Telegram. I really don’t care to know who joins the service from my contacts every time it occurs. Turning this notification off does not from stoping them from continuing to arrive in-app, and the only way to stop this is to turn off Notifications in my phone’s global settings, but doing so will make one forego notifications that I do care about, such as from new messages. It’s baffling they choose to force users have to deal with this, it’s the one thing that’s making me consider leaving the app altogether.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-15T18:12:11-07:00"},{"id":"6179664844","userName":"Monet Kay Love","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id106058545","version":"6.2.1","score":3,"title":"Great.... But","text":"I love telegram, a friend put me onto the app. It's nice for dating when you don't want to give out your number or socials to stay discreet. You can only voice call no video call.. I don't mind though, you can send videos, pictures and voice messages. But they took away timed photos/videos. That was my FAVORITE feature, it's like Snapchat if I want to send a video or picture I could time it... But I can't anymore, please bring feature back. It seems like every single update they take away a great feature, I shouldn’t have to download something on my computer to sign into a new phone , I know it makes you guys think you’re being secure but it’s making it more complicated.... bout ready to say a few this app and go to WhatsApp , not everyone has a computer they can concurrently download on just to sign in on a new phone .
