I’m writing however to warn people about a current trend I’ve run into a couple times. 

I’m looking for work, as many of us are, and have been contacted by individuals promising interviews for work that seems far too good to be true. Flexible hours, extremely high pay, and the entire interview process is via Telegram. 

They promise to send equipment or some other type of “company provided” office supplies or training materials. It’s a long run around involving no phone calls or video calls. In the end they want to send you checks for these supplies and it is all an attempt to move money through your accounts and get your financial information. 

I’ll just say, if you’re looking for work and never actually speak to the individual or notice online the job isn’t posted etc. stay away.
