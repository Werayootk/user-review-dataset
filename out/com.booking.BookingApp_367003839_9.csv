I thought the property was very unique since we have to hike up a hill to get to our cabin. Very nice landscaping and we saw wildlife. The room was clean but tons of bugs at night. We even found a scorpion in our bathroom. The only problem we had was the hot water not working in our cabin and they were not able to fix it. They offer us another room on the property due to being sold out for both days we were there. We opted in staying in our cabin and took a cold water shower. The staff was very kind and welcoming.

Third set of room keys worked to get in room. Door had a note on it to lift door handle up while no other doors had this. That should have red flagged this for me, but I was exhausted after a long day of travel. 

I requested a quiet room on booking. This did not happen. Wooden floors sounded like a herd of animals stomping around most night. If I wanted a room with an old creaky floor, I would have chosen a historic home to stay in. 

Last but not least, no hot water in the morning. I let the water run for 30 to try and warm up. My hopeful expectation never happened. Noting better to start a cold day off with a ‚ÄúIce Cold Shower.‚Äù  

On check out, the front desk was not productive at all to settle the issues. They pulled up my phone number from the reservation and said the manager would follow up with me. Not a way to handle a business.
