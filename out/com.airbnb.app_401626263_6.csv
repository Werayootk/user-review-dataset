10907377297,Granchula,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id572898229,24.05,3,App is so hard to use,It’s so hard to just get on and get on a map in area and look at house cause there is a stupid scroll bar at the top that is so hard to use. Literally just makes me angry and want to stop using it all together why can the choosing a beach house or view be in one of the tabs where you select if you want a hot tub and stuff like that. It literally makes me want to chuck my phone,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-05T22:51:00-07:00

10882314306,vroc_15,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id429542506,24.04,4,From a Host Perspective:,"As a guest, love the Airbnb app. So easy to use. 

As a host, absolutely dislike what happened to the ""Earnings"" section and how you can't click into it anymore from the ""Insights"" summary. That toggle was common sense to me and very user friendly. Earnings section needs improvement and better reporting capabilities.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-30T13:23:54-07:00
10881781057,ProgramDirector,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29366629,24.04,3,mixed,"i have used mostly the app and it’s suited to do most of the things. i needed to contact AirBNB support through the app. it’s really a pain to go back and forth between support chat and reservation details. if you have had previous support chats, they’re often listed as “in progress” (after 6 months?) and the current chat is in the middle somewhere. in order to access the current one, you have to click on “contact us”, which you already have. the support guy at the other end doesn’t have access to all your info, and refers you to the website and asks whether it’s possible for you to use a laptop with chrome or mozilla firefox. then he’s disappeared.
Addendum: if you have reservation that you want to give the support guy, good luck. you can’t select the code; so you can’t copy it. 
i don’t know if there might be other problems with the app, but this experience has not left me with a good feeling.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-30T09:54:19-07:00

10876139002,grgryp,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id489236273,24.04,3,Mixed Experiences,I no longer use Airbnb unless there’s a significant value advantage versus a local hotel. I have had too many mixed experiences or plainly poor experiences. Also all the fees seem absurd. The only times I stay now are for unique places that don’t overcharge (very rare) or for large group stays.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-28T20:41:02-07:00
