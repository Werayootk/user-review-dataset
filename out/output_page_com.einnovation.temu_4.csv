They were exactly what I was hoping I would get. I ended up placing another order that same week and this time I was ordering things for me. I hate buying clothes online bc the cheaper they are, the cheaper they usually feel. I gave it a shot and now my favorite shirts I got from Temu. I have told all of my friends and family about it and I have placed multiple orders myself. The shipping is always free and arrives about a week later. You get step by step tracking. Their return policy is awesome! I tried returning one thing that didn‚Äôt fit well and I was refunded that exact second. I recommend you give Temu a try!

The order came in at a surprisingly fast rate of around a week. This was a surprise because normally products from China and around China take normally 3-4 weeks to arrive. The smoothie cups I got were exactly fit to the description as well as the straws. I have ordered many more things and do not regret it at all.

I‚Äôm still satisfied with the things I order and I will still accept it because it‚Äôs similar to what I ordered but it‚Äôs either the order is wrong or I accidentally made a mistake with my ordering process. However whenever it‚Äôs me who makes the mistake I‚Äôm not going to blame temu for my actions.

Then $0.1 and $0.1, you thought it‚Äôs finally done, only $0.1 to go. Maybe invite another friend will help you reach the free gifts. But no! It breaks again into $0.05.

The item is exactly as the picture. The cost is cheap and cheaply made but look nice and unsure what the quality may be and materials used. The item description should have more information. For example the type of material the metal is and if it‚Äôs silver plated or chrome plated. Even the coins. Are these real or mass produced and made from what? I know you get what you pay for. Plus the fact something can not be vintage when it‚Äôs newly made. Thanks though. Even though cheaply made in third world countries I may order again because I do like the look of many things listed and where else can you get something for that price that you like the looks of! Everything was packaged nicely and I was kept informed on my shipment! Thanks, Randy",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-01T15:20:43-07:00

That's where shipping gets delayed and becomes a waiting game.  This part is not actually Temu's fault.   Customs does things on their own schedule.  
If you buy clothing, buy a size up.  The clothing runs small.  Same with the shoes and the shoes all seem to be narrow fit.  HAND WASH all the clothing you buy and do NOT put it in a dryer even on the delicate cycle.  One trip in the washer and dryer and the thread that holds the clothes together falls out. Happily I can sew. But still the clothing doesn't last long even if you hand wash it.  Expect to only wear the clothing you buy from here a couple of times unless you want to re-sew everything. 
The household items are the same quality of what you buy in a dollar store.  But I'm not sure why anyone would expect anything different with the prices these items are.  
I will order little things here and there but not clothes or shoes again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-15T07:41:48-07:00

The products I‚Äôve ordered have all be amazing and great quality for low price! And I‚Äôve made several orders. How ever I don‚Äôt like how there are so many games and so many ways to win free gifts and things and yet they are all so impossible to win. I‚Äôve spent months on the app. And I‚Äôve learned each games time always seems to run out right when you‚Äôre about to win the free prizes. Maybe I just have bad luck. I‚Äôm not sure but it seems to never fail when I‚Äôm a few percentages away from growing the adult fish or a few bucks from the free gift or a few coins away from getting the last prize from the 3 hat trick game my time runs out and I have to start the game over. You‚Äôd think after purchasing so many items the games would become easier to win to keep costumers attention. Getting the free items would help boost sales. But as I said maybe I just have poor luck.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-01T20:18:09-07:00
10064974292,cannot find nickname to use,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id195413550,1.80.0,5,Good value and prices for many products particularly clothing.,"I have ordered numerous items - including clothing and shoes for men and women and a number of gadgets.  The best have been the clothing items although the fabric has not always been good- particularly for the man‚Äôs shirt.  Also had to return one woman‚Äôs top as fabric was unsatisfactory although print colors were good.  The very  inexpensive items are the worst for value and quality.  It is not worth returning them- so I am absorbing one or two that totally did not work as loss leaders for the many others that were satisfactory or better in quality.    All in all, Temu provides good products for far less than the equivalent in the domestic market.  The free shipping policy is also a plus as are the incentives for buying more from them.  I have not looked into the allegations of their unfair labor practices which others have alleged.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-23T11:24:35-07:00

When I heard about temu & how viral it was going I just figured it was like a bootlegged Shein app. But it isn‚Äôt! The more and more I saw videos on how cheap the quality products were just amazes me. People were confused & skeptical to buy from the app because it looks like a scam. I decided to spend about $25 on the app. The shipping was 10 Days. The only problem were, when my items finally arrived around 8pm at night. I was sure my package was about to get delayed but nope. I loved everything that I received. I made a video on me opening everything as well. One product was fine but the box was damaged . When I opened the product it looks like it has already been used but it is a highlighter so idk. Temu needs to work on the orange packaging because it looks so beat upü§£.

I think I have ordered about seven times already in less than a month. The only thing that saddens me is that not everything is as expected or the fitting sometimes even though it says true fit it doesn‚Äôt always mean that I don‚Äôt like to return anything but unfortunately I have. I think if the website would have a description of what type material it‚Äôs made of. It would be easier for me in what not to pick and if you do, I can‚Äôt figure it out but if we can see it under the picture that you can click on it or something and it tells you what exactly the material is made of it would be a lot easier for me and I am sure for a lot of other people to make a decision and possibly not have to return anything because that is my goal to not have to return anything but unfortunately I have had to.
