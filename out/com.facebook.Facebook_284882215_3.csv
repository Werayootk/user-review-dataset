But I’ve found that there is less and less control over what gets posted. I’ve reported some nasty stuff, without any better way of describing why I reported it and having it ignored, including some things that I thought were security issues. You can’t describe concerns and if it doesn’t fit in those limited categories, you have no way to do anything.  There are also pages presented as one thing (nature pictures or cute animals and all of a sudden on “reels”they put up huge breasty women without much and other crazy, unacceptable pictures, some are very suggestive! It’s difficult to get rid of or report them too. I don’t live to report things, but nobody seems to be trying to get rid of those things. It’s not as much fun or user friendly as it was. Please tamp down the dangerous political rhetoric, the people going after people in the comments, the nudity and very suggestive ads and pictures and moderate! Allow us to describe when there’s a real problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-18T21:00:36-07:00

Facebook is one of the worst for that. The reason I write this review, however, is because of how bad customer service is. It’s nonexistent! If you have some type of concern or issue, good luck! And they claim you can file a complaint or issue online, however, no matter what you try to select, it doesn’t lead you to any type of chat or service, just their ‘help center’ which absolutely does nothing to help you. If you get hacked or locked out of your account, good luck getting it back and anything associated with the account (including memories like photos and videos, or important posts and messages). If you post something with a specific word or statement in it, it’ll automatically flag your account. If someone else says or does something alarming, good luck trying to report it, even if it is an obvious scam account!! I got reported for a post that was nothing political or controversial, just a song or something, yet, I just dealt with an obvious scammer and the account didn’t get any repercussions, even after I reported it (though only the boys check and found nothing going against their “community guidelines”).

Because now I cannot post any video from my iPad. Which has been my only way to post, comment, or respond. Since their new publishing authorization thing. I have sent probably 25 feedback messages. Which is basically just a waste of my time, because they are never going to respond in any way. Really wish they didn’t have such a monopoly on the multimedia market. I have never really been into the way Twitter works, but the one time I had a pro and messaged them they responded in a few hours.

I was able to figure out how to change my password and after multiple attempts over a period of five days, was finally able to get back in. I’m sure the hackers just moved onto another account after being done with mine. The only reason I wanted to get my account back was because I have pictures and videos of my kids from when they were babies and didn’t want to lose them. Additionally, I can’t find some of my friends, they just don’t exist when I look them up, but as I’m sitting next to them I can clearly see they have an account. I am not sure why this is and I will never know as Facebook has horrific customer service or should I say non existent customer service. 
I’ve been a member for over 15 years and this was something I can’t even relay the frustration I had from this. I really hope they didn’t make a lot of money from people I am friends with and luckily my friends knew that the items they were selling to get money know I did not own those things.

On top of the massive insurgence of fake accounts, spam accounts, and bot accounts Facebook has decided to employ some sort of self-defeatist/self-destruction scheme where it makes a political and social step to police its communities and legitimate accounts under a draconian anti-Free speech system that suspends a user from being able to interact with their own friends if a random follower or bot-account reports them instead of advising the individual to block the person they have issue with they torpedo an actual user and side with the bots.

This happens via the App or website, it doesn’t matter. It started happening about 6 months ago but was sporadic but now it’s the consistent behavior I get daily with Facebook. I object to the decision to the ban but since Facebook is garbage and there is no way to get any customer support and I while can report bugs they never go answered and I have no idea if the issue is being reviewed.

It is designed to make you click and stay on as long as possible in order to sell more ads and make more money. The way they do this is by showing users content they will react to. They can do this by showing them more and more of what they already like. When they do this, they exclude conflicting information. This means that whatever you believe to be true or right (regardless of whether it is actually true or right), will be repeated to you over and over and over and over. It traps users in a bubble of information (or disinformation) and it's brainwashing!  And it makes them money. The other way to get users to react and stay on the platform is to show them things they will react negatively to-like  posts that make them angry enough to dislike or comment on. They will then shower you with similar or related posts to keep you engaged. You will constantly see things that make you angry so you will keep engaging. Who wants to live in a state of constant anger? But you're not even presented with this choice. You are provoked by facebook to keep reacting.

After a few days I was FINALLY able to create a new account, which it wasn’t letting me for the longest time, even when using a different email, but eventually was successful.

I’m glad they looked out for my account and disabled it for safety purposes, however, I was also paying for an employment add boosting and wasn’t able to access any of it, but yet they still continued to pull funds until I canceled my card. There just needs to be more help options to speak to someone other than you just reading about what might help or things to try, when you actually have account access.

My “crime” was sharing other’s widely disseminated posts, there were just two. The first was a legitimate article written by an actual journalist who documented another being banned from Twitter. The second was a meme.  It was a photo collage of a politician at official state functions, all from the public domain, not photoshopped.  The individual photos are famous.  Collage or not, they just happened to put the politician in an unflattering light, just like the individual’s gaffe filled speeches and absurd actions on video.

Yet Zuckerberg lobbied hard to bring help Congress build a case to ban Tiktok. This took it too far for me. Seriously, FB has many data privacy issues and is a huge risk for US citizens and our government security. It's even had a breach where Russia tried to manipulate our Presidential elections.
Congress should get real about who's really violating the US's privacy and stop lying to manipulate the narrative all for your personal interest. If it's data insecurity, Tiktok has secured our data better than any current US application. So that can't be the problem. We (U.S. citizens) are tired of dealing with a Congress that operates under a misguided, hypocritical agenda, and is one that can be bought by corrupt, spoiled tech CEOs. What we can thank Zuckerberg for is opening our eyes & showing us who not to vote for as our representatives.

Prior to META and this weekend, I would have given FB five stars, even though a number of my friends reported having been hacked, phishing scams, and others saying their accounts had been deleted. Several days ago, I received a notice saying my account had been permanently removed because I posted something inappropriate on Instagram. I did not, and the offending post the notice pictured was in Chinese. When I looked at who had posted it, it was a Chinese name I’ve never heard of, and there is no Instagram account under that name. There’s evidently no way to appeal this on Facebook itself—only on Instagram, which I’ve done. But I hold little hope of this being rectified by the system. So, users beware. The lights may be on at META, but it seems like nobody’s home. Particularly during Covid, Facebook—to which I’d belonged for many years—became a way for me to connect with far-flung family, friends, and work colleagues, and to communicate about my business in real estate. I now have no way to contact people—relatives and friends, including people I graduated high school with. META has left me high and dry. This is a problem the folks at META need to fix.

Work together, work together, work together.....through all our differences and beliefs.....work together...Facebook you where supposed to be glue for humanity , neutral, glue is neutral- it doesn’t pick sides. Facebook knows it’s influence, they don’t get to act like they don’t know.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-26T21:14:15-07:00

The continual and complex privacy features seem to be largely a CYA action to cover up FB own intrusion to privacy while managing to restrict freedom of speech at same time🤥 (as I currently reload one account to gain access to manage photos feature). I’ve never seen so many scam and MLM marketing advertisements as the ones forced into my newsfeed, sponsored marketplace ads (even if I choose local PU only!) ...the sheer number of obvious fake FB account friend requests (seriously, NO photos, NO friends🤪😜…and constantly ignoring my preference Not to have friend requests or suggestions from these accounts!). When scam, for profit obscure “fundraisers” are called out in comments...FB allows the companies to moderate and delete the comments...admittedly it’s a tough issue to vet advertisers- so why not let customers post feedback in comments...or have a link to public records of alleged performance of “for profit” fundraising companies hiding behind legitimate non-profits? 

Sorry to rant, could go on...but I do have hope for the future...and can’t wait for more competitive platforms to develop!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-23T16:15:18-07:00

8650358317,T Crowe Semler,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id578621173,365.0,1,Facebook Fraud,Facebook Ad’s charged my credit card $500. for an ad that I did not place. I placed a stop payment with my credit card company. The Facebook suspended my account due to nonpayment. They have no direct email communication for consumers. They then said I broke “Community Standards” accusing me of 17 unacceptable posts which they would not be specific or show the post. Then they said my new T-Mobile account and iPhone 13 were not compatible with my 14 year old Facebook account. It appears that Facebook Ads attempted Fraud and then once discovered brought multiple manufactured / made up reasons to Suspend my account. I requested a “review of my account” and was never given an outcome of the review. I was notified that time had expired for the review and my account was disable. Now my Facebook account (with MY Name) shows up on Google in multiple languages. Facebook still has not responded to my requests for an additional review of my suspended account. I trusted Facebook in good faith to protect my Facebook account. They did not. They have purposely made customer service communication nonexistent. Why ? Because they just want to glean your personal info and sell it. They don’t care about there Facebook users. Be aware of Facebook Fraud !,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-08T08:14:25-07:00

My main issue today is that nothing is loading. Not sure why. Errors all over the app. However, their entire self policing thing is.... a mess. I have been put on post bans for things that do follow the community guidelines, however if I report someone saying something genuinely awful like... okay the most recent... so a friend shared a post about a family that had lost their trailer in a fire. Thankfully they were not there, but they lost everything and have a baby. Do they were asking for donations for... everything. And someone posted that an abortion would take care of the babies needs. The baby is several months old and even if it wasn't that is not something you say to someone who is pregnant. Nothing was done. However I got hit because I was trying to correct someone's ignorance about why Rome failed with a link to an article written by actual historians and got marked as spam. If all my friends weren't on here, I wouldn't use it. I use it specifically to stay in contact with friends and mindless meme posting.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-04T11:33:34-07:00
7543812167,VMandi,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id440225952,325.0,1,The Death of Free Speech,"I had left facebook about four years ago because I’d found myself spending too much of my free time worrying about what other people think of me. Frankly, it’s been blissful being free of social media, but I’ve grown to appreciate the value of being connected to friends who are otherwise unreachable. I do miss them. However, I will never be returning to facebook again, nor any other mainstream social media platform. Why? Because like most things nowadays, thanks to, um... (cough cough) current events, facebook is no longer about connectivity and self expression. It has become precisely what George Orwell has been warning us about for ages. Their constant censoring of perfectly valid questions and concerns of safety have made that apparent. I pity anyone who has tried speaking their mind, speaking the truth, and been censored and even deplatformed as a result. The truth needs to be broadcast for all to hear, now more than ever! It doesn’t even matter if what an individual is saying is relevant or not! They have the right to say it! And the right to say it uncensored! So I am giving facebook this horrific review in the hopes that changes will be made. In the hopes that free speech, and freedom itself, will be restored. 
Sincerely,

I don’t have any other accounts with FB. Once my account was created I requested to join pages from three nearby cities for selling and buying within my area. I noticed 95% of the dozens of pages are controlled by FB and not actual people. I requested to join them. I was accepted in several until around the 4th one and FB locked my account. They stated they wanted me to open my camera settings and stream live video footage to their Admins. NEVER EVER in my life have I been requested/demanded to do anything such as this for any social media account. I use many other Apps and never any trouble.

I highly recommend you never download this App and stay very far away with anything to do with these people. I had heard stories from contractors that worked at their nearby facility near me. They’re really creepy people and our Gov should really dissect this company ASAP; the tracing/tracking their performing is completely illegal.

Good grief, simply trying to sell household goods and purchase some contractor products and they demanded a live stream vid of my face. That is beyond acceptable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-30T09:28:31-07:00

Double standards when it comes to Ukraine and Palestine , censorship’s and pushing a one sided narrative. The platform has been weaponized against the general public, in the pandemic they banned anyone who questioned their narrative and forced vaccines on everyone even though many people don’t want this vaccine that’s a violation of human rights. Facebook should be sued for weaponizing the platform. Yes we are against racism and violence but when you allow it against Muslims on your platform and ban it when it comes to others that’s double standards right there and tells you how hypocritical this company is. Story short I’m thinking of deleting all Facebook apps and strictly for their racism against Muslims and their censorship of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is a constitutional right no one should be able to censor other people’s views and ideas regardless if your platform is private or not.

Now I guess they just are rolling in the money, and don't really have to communicate in any way or form to their members. I now manage my Father's business account and have been for over 5 years. In the last 6 months it has spiraled down crazily. They just implemented a Publishing Authorization thing that has literally haunted my ability to post from my computer at all. They also seem to keep creating problems in their system. Because now I cannot post any video from my iPad. Which has been my only way to post, comment, or respond. Since their new publishing authorization thing. I have sent probably 25 feedback messages. Which is basically just a waste of my time, because they are never going to respond in any way. Really wish they didn't have such a monopoly on the multimedia market. I have never really been into the way Twitter works, but the one time I had a pro and messaged them they responded in a few hours. With a detailed description of what was going on, and some advice about how to fix it.
