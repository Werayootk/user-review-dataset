Wrong references is another big issues. One can't copy and paste large documents for analysis and review. This limitation has to go if ChatGPT wants to survive.

Pros include easy access to certain knowledge, excellent ability to rewrite paragraphs and other texts.

Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-16T12:18:17-07:00

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now.
