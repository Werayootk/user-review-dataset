1) I wish I could exclude things from my budget. I set a low weekly budget, but when I have to pay rent/utilities it nukes the budget. If I could exclude them it would make the budget tool useful, until then it doesn’t help unfortunately.

1. They are not a bank. They have applied for a Bank Charter and it HAS NOT been approved. They rely on an actual bank.

2. The chat will not provide any type of good service. Instead, they seem to just “pass the buck”.

3. They are considered a “Prepaid Account” and the debit card they issue you is a “Prepaid Card” according to PayPal, CashApp and other banks.

4. You cannot transfer funds into your card. It will not work with PayPal, Venmo or CashApp.

5. They are Russian owned. Beware that they say they are based in the UK.

6. They will freeze your account with warning, for no reason at all.

7. They make money by providing products accounts. I would recommend not upgrading or giving them a dime for these unneeded services.

8. Limited amount of ATM withdrawals before they start charging you fees.

My review after a year, it’s a prepaid account, and prepaid style card. Worthless.

If you decide to download the app and face any issues skip talking to who the say in their own words is “best way to speak to them via the in-app chat” and save yourself sometime and ask them to give you the link to initiate a formal claim. All claims made in the in-app chat are not real claims as you are chatting to probably some 3rd party “call center”.

Revolut said we will need to investigate, 7-10 days later I never got a response. I chat in 3 Times a days no response. Till one day I have to get surgery done & people are depending on sending money to this account.

 I contact revolut, they closed my account due to the fact they can’t verify my information. PERMANENTLY..

Also they did the same thing to my fiancé card. She hasn’t had her card for a year they are asking her to verify her card she lost also. She couldn’t then they closed her account to.

The company directs you to post information in their Facebook group which then lets people know you have an account with them and now people have personal information about you as well.
