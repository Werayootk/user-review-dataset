Many people I know have stopped paying because so many songs they listen to are gone. They also owe me money for overcharging me one month. Decided it was better to air it out then fight for hours to get the money back like the time before.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T08:07:23-07:00
