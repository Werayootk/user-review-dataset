(Music platforms I’ve used premium for: SoundCloud, Apple Music) Out of all of the platforms I’ve used, this one trumps all of them by having the greatest variety of songs. Literally all of my music is on here, including covers, nightcore, pop, rock, indie, alternative, rap, and foreign genres like kpop and jpop. It also has the lyrics automatically displayed and as someone who likes to sing and sometimes read for better lyrics comprehension, this is a great feature to have! Of course I have premium but I’ve used the free version for a considerable amount of time, and I can say that it’s definitely worth it to get premium for no ads, unlimited skips, and infinite playlist customization. I love listening to playlists I’ve created on this app! I have over 20 of them so far. This feature is awesome; you can share playlists with friends (and even collaborate with them on playlists too!), put a custom cover image, add a description, and add whatever songs you want. I like this feature because then I don’t have to manually change songs every time one ends. The fact that you can download songs is great too, and this app works on very low bandwidth so if you’re on a plane that offers wifi you can listen without having to worry. Overall I’d say if you’re considering going premium, this app is a must have! But if you want the free version, just know you’ll have limited control over what you play and when you play it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-06T13:05:26-07:00

I’d like to have a true random shuffle *and* the shuffle the app has made, personally.. But there’s some people out there with solutions to the shuffling issue, my personal favourite being choose a true random song, and shuffle the rest as you do based on that song as the starting point.
Overall very positive as it’s sort of.. just what I need, with realistic downsides that I can’t expect to not run into. Thank you for hearing me out :D",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T01:42:56-07:00

Premium is a pretty good deal but good luck getting it, not only do you have to go to a website but the chances of that website working properly on your phone is unlikely. Your address is needed to purchase premium but whenever I go to put it in there isn’t a place where I can tap on to put it in. You used to be able to minimize ads when you were on the app but now you have to watch the many ads, which also show up every 5 songs. They make ads about their own playlists like they couldn’t just make it pop up on the homepage, and they also repeat ads over and over again until you can recite them word for word. They say they listen to their users but only to the users who write good reviews. When share playing with your computer almost all the time there will be lyrics in the song that don’t even play. Another thing that I find very annoying is the whole 6 skips every HOUR which is not at all worth it because even when skipping you still get ads. Then there’s choosing songs, say you look up a song and try to play it, there will be 5-6 songs that you will have to listen to or skip through to listen to the song you want to, I like the idea of suggesting songs but it should at least play the song I want to listen to first or second.

I click and theres no visual feedback. I check and the song was not liked and the plaulist was not deleted. Sometimes it marks songs as ""liked"" and I never liked it before. This is stupid.

Or I hit add to playlist and it actually does do it, BUT gives me no visual feedback or confirmation, doesn't ask me ""this song is already in the playlist"", nothing.  So yeah, great app but some features don't work in my car.

Also I HATE that you made the Library tab include everything and I have to hit ""Playlist"" to filter my library to just playlists. Why are you putting in an extra step for no reason.

First of all, what is up with all the ads? Like i play one or two songs, and then it plays like two to three ads afterwards. Its super annoying especially because they play the same ads over and over and over. Like, if I wanted shopify, don’t you think I would’ve pressed “learn more” by now? I tried pressing the thumbs down button but it doesn’t do anything, even when i pressed “report explicit content” to make it go away. Also, when an add says i will now have 30 mins of uninterrupted listening, it often gives me like 6 ads in that time anyway. Another thing is the skips issue. I only have 6 skips per hour, and most of the time i have to use them to get past all the suggested songs it throws in. Like if I select a song or artist to listen to, it gives me all these completely random artists and songs instead. And I have no idea when my original song will play because the radio is on permanent shuffle. It even happens in my own playlists!! It just gives me stupid songs i don’t even like instead of mine and doesn’t let me play them in order! Honestly, whats the point of a playlist if I can’t even PLAY the LIST. Ridiculous.

My best friend and I love this feature but recently it's been a little buggy. Sometimes only one of us can control the music, and if the other tries, everything stops and we have to restart the app and start a new session, which is annoying. We've also found that sometimes when we create a session we are hearing completely different songs, or the same song but not in sync. When this feature works it's really fun but these little quirks can be very frustrating and tedious to deal with. Also in regards to the group sessions, it would be nice to be able to send invites to friends within the app so that you don't have to deal with links that can be tricky sometimes. Lastly I've noticed one thing that bothers me a little: when you're adding music to your playlists and you click a song to add, it puts you right back to the recommended songs to add. This is frustrating when I'm trying to add multiple songs from the same album or artist and i have to go and search up the album or artist for every single song I add.

Sometimes admittedly, it’s just because my app needs updated, but it will also do that completely randomly at times. What is with that? I’ll continue playing my music again, and not only will the song restart, but it also cuts off again but even earlier than it did before. It’s honestly extremely annoying and very difficult to deal with when I’m working either at home or at my job. Nine times out of ten, I’d have to close the app completely, and wait thirty to ninety minutes before my music will play uninterrupted again. It’s incredibly frustrating, especially since all I want is to play some music. 

Another thing is six skips per hour? Really? That’s so incredibly annoying, and it makes it worse when I’m wasting all my skips on the stupid suggested tracks you give me. I don’t want to listen to that!? If you absolutely HAVE to put something in, play more of the same artist at least. It’s so annoying to only have six skips and waste them all on music that I never wanted to hear in the first place. The worst part is, even if I go to a different playlist and come back, it continues playing the suggested track. I don’t want it! On that note, I also don’t want the extra songs you put in my playlists. I take one track off, another gets added.

There is also one ad that really annoys me; its the juvedurm ad. Its one minute long talking about lip fillers. I cannot tell you how many times I have down thumbed this ad, but I still hear it. Take it off. It’s so annoying to listen to! Also, get new ads. This app plays the same ads over and over again. If I was actually interested, I would tap on the learn more button.  But have I done that? No, so stop giving me the same ad. Next, shuffle. Mobile users, I don’t recommend using this app. Your playlists are on shuffle: which means you can’t listen to your music in order. Also, mobile users, this app only gives you six skips a hour. You have to wait a whole hour to get more skips. It’s very annoying and not fun to deal with. Next thing, mobile users, I again do not advise to this app. On your playlists, they have shuffle, six skips, and recommended songs. If I liked those songs, I would put them on my playlist! Then, you end up loosing all your skips on songs you never wanted to listen to in the first place. It’s reallllllllllllly frustrating. If I take a recommended song off, it only adds another.

And that’s if there’s creativity involved; if not it’s just repeat the same words back to back to back to back. So you’re saying we haven’t got any smarter since Biblical times?

Because I can't do that, I literally just go onto my liked songs and listen through there but its annoying cause I listen to many genres and sometimes I just sit and skip through songs just to find the right one. It's annoying and I just wish you guys made it easier. 

I also wanted to bring up that recently, I literally can hardly play my music because it always just stops and cuts off. At first, I thought it was an issue with my car's bluetooth so I just connected my wire to play music through ApplePlay but that didn't stop the issue either. When I tried playing music with my earphones on, it kept doing the same thing. I would literally have to restart the entire app just for it to work but then it would just randomly cut off again.

I cant get rid of shuffle mode so I saw another glitch. Lets say that i decided to make my own playlist, I make it and other songs are added just because of shuffle mode, but you can add songs to get rid of them. Okay, then my playlist “ends” and then RANDOM songs play.. I have to play a different playlist now. and sometimes if i return to the one that i was playing the song is still there, and if i skip it more random songs will start playing, then i have to wait a whole HOUR to get more skips. I feel like non premium users should have more freedom of doing what they want. oh, and with shuffle mode on, you cant pick a song or make it into a loop. and like i said, after a little bit you cant turn shuffle mode off.

It would do this in a cycle until I skipped the song because I couldn’t handle hearing the first half of the song on repeat anymore. Occasionally it would work for one or two songs but that only happened rarely.

You use to be able to choose whatever song you would want to listen to on your playlist and you could shuffle play too but now you are only able to shuffle play if you don’t have the premium membership, and also, when I tap on the list of all of my songs in my playlist and I find a song that I want to play, it only plays a preview of the song. I think the shuffle play is kinda dumb because whenever I shuffle play it and my last song on my playlist stops playing (because the song is over) it moves on to a new song that I haven’t added to my playlist and whenever I hit the button that says “Shuffle Play” it controls if the song is paused or playing. I tried exiting out and reopening the app but the song is still there and acts as if it’s in my playlist.

     Now for some new tweaks. 
I would like to see more customization with the quick swiping right or left on a song. There should be a setting to be able to change what a swipe left or a swipe right means instead of it always being queuing a song or liking it.
The other feature I would like added is to be able to change the order on how your playlists display on your public profile. Let’s be honest, there are definitely better playlists that are created than others. I feel like this could be done two different ways. A: give the user full customization of the order, or B: allow the user to pin 3-4 playlists on their public profile sort of how the pin feature works for your playlists in your personal music library.

You have to pay for unlimited skips and to select songs. If you do want to select a song that you’ve been listening to, the “Daily Mix” playlists allow you to do that but there’s no guarantee that the song you want is in one of those playlists. It would also be great if you didn’t have to add like 10 songs to a playlist for the app to jot add random song to your playlist. It has to add more song to the playlist to be able to play in shuffle, but if it just DIDNT MAKE YOU LISTEN ON SHUFFLE FOR EVERYTHING, then bam, no random songs in your playlists.

The “Genre” option doesn’t even exist. If you want to organize by artist/album it has to download your artist/album’s songs. It’s just a bunch of ridiculous extra buttons that I shouldn’t ever need to deal with. 

My least favorite thing about this app is, songs will randomly become censored without warning. That means, I was in a huge Johnny Cash phase, and had listened to “A Boy Named Sue” like a hundred times, then one day, the line goes from “I’m the son of a ***** that named you Sue” to “I’m the [BLEEEEEEEEEEEEP] that named you Sue”. Like WHY. All of my songs are fine, but one day suddenly one will be censored after enjoying it for months. I’m paying for this service, and have no parental settings or anything turned on to make that happen on my end. This should not ever happen.

Besides that, it’s decent enough as a music app. Music comes out fine, making playlists is easy, they do have a wide selection of music, and even have personalized playlists that aren’t so bad a lot of the time. I can organize my songs in any order I want to. Sure, if I want songs organized by genre, I have to make an entire separate playlist or just listen to a pre-made playlist with songs that I don’t even care about that I have to constantly skip and skip and skip, but hey, at least it’s somewhat possible.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-16T18:21:55-07:00

It would help with being able to select a mass number of playlists to easily delete. It would also be good to have a similar feature with adding songs. If there were a button that allowed you to add the same song to multiple playlists at once, instead of having to go through each playlist and add the song individually. Also, it would be good if in a playlist you could organize where each song goes like if you want to organize it alphabetically or something on mobile. Finally, it would be nice if you could add a way to view the amount of streams an album has, or make it easier to see. A group of people including me are trying to get an album to a certain number of streams, and I can’t view the number, although i think other people can, so if you could make the streams a bit easier to access that would be nice.

However, since I haven’t purchased anything to lose a majority of functions such as picking individual songs that I would love to start listening to instead being treated to something entirely different from the song I picked is frustrating, cause what is the point of liking songs if I am unable to listen to those songs, because I haven’t gotten premium. I don’t mind listen to ads if it gets me to the song I want to listen to or skip a song that I don’t want to listen to then slowly transitions into more songs. This makes the search function obsolete if I search for a song only to get something completely different from the song I wanted. Or look for an album that I want to listen to only to not listen to the whole album. Though picking specific podcast episodes seems to function the way the whole app should.

If you want this for free, there are a lot of issues that I found makes it hard to find what you want to listen to or pick out specific songs that you want making liked songs unimportant if you can’t listen to them at a later time.

I’m even okay with the only six skips an hour thing because I’m not picky and I have multiple playlists I can listen to. However, for some reason every time I’m listening to the music nowadays the app will randomly exit out and stop playing music. I have to physically get back into the app just to restart the song I’d been listening to, and it always starts back up at like 0:07, so I’ll listen to like 3/4 of the song AGAIN just for it to cut out and I have to restart the process over. Just now I listened to the same song seven times in a row without completion. This is a consistent problem that’s pushed me to write a review (which I don’t normally do). I’ve even gone online to see what I can do to fix it and tried all the suggestions (exiting out of all other apps, completely logging out of my account and logging back in, etc.) and it still does it.

Why I don’t like about this app: first is how you can’t  just pick a song from a playlist and not have limited skips, I think that’s kinda weird to not be able to play a song you wanna hear from your playlist. Now I wanna talk about the adds, let’s just say it’s irritating like when your listening too a song and just randomly get this add that says. “Watch this short add for 30 mins of add free music” then when I hit “no thanks” a add plays like do y’all do this to make more money or just to be irritating 😐😑🙄 like c’mom can we just get no adds!?!?!? And just buy premium for better quality, limited skips, and just pick songs from playlists and not wait 1 hour for 6 skips?

It’s so useful for discovering new music while doing other things. For example, I can shuffle a playlist of new songs while doing chores, and then go back when I’m done to save the songs I liked. Also good when other people are adding songs to a queue, meaning I would have no way of getting back to the song w/o a history feature. 

My main gripe (only one I can think of) is how personalized playlists— like daily mixes or radio stations— lately have a tendency to change while I’m listening to them. I’ll pick a station based on seeing a good lineup I want to hear, but then as I get partway through, the playlist automatically reshuffles with new songs, and I don’t get to hear what I wanted to. It happens especially if I “like” a new song while listening. 

I get that it’s meant to adapt to your taste dynamically, but it’s annoying when it wipes the playlist you were just listening to (not just the upcoming songs, but the ones you already listened to also).

No one has the time to swipe for 30 seconds to the bottom of their library when they want to listen to The Who. A quick scroll has been a standard on every music app for years now. Get with the times!

2. The artist library page needs a royal update. Or retro-date, rather. I had an older version of the app until yesterday where all artists whose music you had saved into your library displayed on the same library in a neat, clean fashion, regardless of whether or not you Follow them. Now you can only neatly organize those artists whom you Follow, and the rest are left in this awkward, disorganized list of artists with a big “Follow” button next to it. We know what you’re doing guys. If we want to follow an artist, we will. For now, just let us organize our artist library in a straightforward fashion.

3. Another retro-date: put back the option to view your Songs Library. Sometimes you just wanna shuffle your songs. Yeah, the “Liked Songs” playlist is there, and that’s cool and all, but it’s not intuitive when you have “Playlists” and “Artists” listed up top.

 My other complaint is more trivial, and it is about the auto play of recommended songs.

However, I just really hate this feature, especially when I am playing songs from a artist that I really like however it is in a genre that I generally hate.

It has those songs that get you in that cruella de vil mood; it’s public so go listen to it!! 

This is obviously a 5 star app, no ads and you can create as many playlists as you want with as many songs as you want, of course there is the payment you have to make but there are no ads so I think it’s a good choice (and you can download your playlist and listen offline👏🏼) However I noticed that you can only add all songs on a playlist made by the songwriter of those songs (for example I was making a kidzbop playlist as a joke btw and I noticed I could put all of the songs from a playlist full of kidzbop songs at once when the playlist was made by kidzbop, but I couldn’t do that when it wasn’t made by kidzbop! I think it’s a great idea that you can do that feature but it would be even better if you could do that for all playlists! 

Thanks for reading! (Look up that playlist!!!) Also sorry if it was a tad hard to understand what I was talking about I don’t really have a great way with words! Bye!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-01T09:04:17-07:00
3748838763,Loven dis app,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id381330758,8.4.92,3,No thanks not worth it,"I think the idea of the app was spot on. I think the execution was terrible. The app is up to date and on top of these songs but it is a pain to work with. An app should always be user friendly and easy to understand but this isn’t it. I don’t like too much music and don’t know that many singers so when it made me choose three that’s a big no, it messed up my recommendations and I’m stuck with sicko mode as a recommendation because I was joking around. The app doesn’t allow you to play just one song, you have to make a playlist and if it’s not big enough it plays “recommended” music which is extremely irritating. Skipping songs only 6 times per hour is ridiculous and only there to make you pay money. Also the fact that you can’t restart your playlist after you’re done and it starts playing other music is uncalled for. I tried everything from looking it up and restarting my phone. Nothing worked. Ik there are hard core fans who know all the ins and outs of this app but that’s not the point, anyone (within reason) should be able to use and app, if they can’t then there is no point to download this app. Lastly I forgot to mention but not being able to add whole albums is also irritating, adding song by song is meticulous.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-08T20:06:36-07:00

And most of the reviews give you guys 1 star and so sense I haven’t used it for a long time I give it 3stars because for now it seems like a good app. And also if you yes you not the creators of the app, if  YOU are reading this, before you just start falling for the reviews that say amazing but... and stuff like that, click on “sort by” and click on most critical and you will see probably like 70 reviews saying all this stuff and if you really think about it, there are only like 13 reviews that say good stuff  about this app! So as I said 3 stars for now and as I start using this app longer I will see if I still like it or if I’m going to go with the other like 70 reviews that say this app is bad.

I used to like that when if on the ""Your Library"" tab you could click on a recently played artist or just an artist from the ""Artists"" tab and it would take you only to the songs you saved from them, but then if you clicked on them from the ""Home"" tab it would take you to their main profile page. Now it takes you to their main page even if you click on the artist from the library tab. It's extremely inconvenient, I would like to listen to only the songs I have saved from an artist not all of them. Before the update at least we had the choice. And as dramatic as this sound I have to agree with other people, it really IS enough to make me want to delete the app because of how inconvenient it has actually become to listen to my saved songs. 

Also the layout is just kinda weird. Well not weird but the one before was definitely better. It had your recently played artists or albums or whatever it is you listen to. And now it's not really like that anymore. Now you gotta go to them from the ""Home"" tab. I won't lie, it doesn't bother me as much as the first thing I mentioned (PLS CHANGE THAT BACK), but it's for sure something I wouldn't mind if y'all brought back.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-06T10:35:03-07:00

But there is one thing that I have a problem with. I’m not sure if I’m the only one with this problem but, basically what happens is while I’m listening to a song It just like, out of nowhere the music just stops! I don’t close the app at all. Usually this happens when my phone isn’t even on. (Like if the screen timeout goes off.) This problem is so annoying, probably more annoying then the adds not gonna lie. And when the music stops, it start all over again! Once this happened to me while I was done with the song so I had to listen to the whole thing again! This has happened so many times. It even happened more then 4 times while I was writing this review! I know I could just skip the song but I would probably run out of skips because I don’t have premium. I just want this to be fixed because it’s really annoying. I hope the app developers see this and fix it. Other then that, this apps one of the best ones I have and one of the most used too!

6539053683,Sailor-Cat,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id954538599,8.5.80,4,It’s great but..,"So I started using it because I didn’t need to have a subscription to use it freely unlike Apple Music which I used for awhile then cancelled the subscription I had. It’s kinda confusing like you can’t really save stuff. Also, the 6 skips an hour thing is annoying too! so I understand it’s most likely to keep the app free and all. but when I made my account it said I could listen with infinite skips and ZERO adds for free nothing about the seven day free premium trial! But no no no life isn’t that simple so basically I download it on my phone for the first time (I made my account on a computer so I could listen to music at school also I still had Apple Music at the time of making the account) and then this notification pops up that my seven day free trial has expired. Oh and this is right after I had texted my mom that’s it completely free! But we could have totally avoided this problem if the developers would just flipping fix their stupid app, and not say that with an account you can “listen completely free with no adds and infinite skips” cause that’s a lie. And don’t reply back to me saying “ That’s not true we say something about the trial!” Because then you’ll be lying even more!😡😡😡",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-15T14:54:05-07:00
5217512885,RoyalMarz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1105747450,8.5.33,3,Please fix this,"This app was amazing, loved it so so much. There are few problems though,1.  it is very difficult to turn shuffle play on and off and it is difficult to know when it is on and when it isn’t. It would be great if there was a way to fix this. 

2. The new update totally screwed the app up, it isn’t worth it anymore, I’m more motivated not get the premium but rather to just go to another app. The library layout is terrible, very difficult to find what you are looking for. Hate it with a passion, and you put a limit to how many songs you can skip without premium? Another issue: when looking through songs, you can’t just pick a song to play and start the playlist from there, it only plays part of the song. Maybe I’m doing some gin wrong there, but it’s terrible now. 

The ads I don’t really mind, annoying, but fine whatever, the layout in the library/playlist is terrible, the shuffle button is broke, and you can only skip so many songs. And I cannot play songs without shuffle. Please please fix the library layout, skipping thing, and how I can only play songs on shuffle. I don’t even want to bother with this app anymore. Before this update, I had no complaints what so ever. Other than the issues listed, amazing app!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-30T09:57:32-07:00
3831712610,Corndog3135,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id184428745,8.4.95,2,Now is unnecessarily complex,"The number one thing I hate about this update is the fact that anytime I pick a song, shuffle turns off. It's literally a joke that I have to turn it on every time I pick a new song. What confuses me is the fact that repeat stays on when shuffle turns off. That needs to be fixed. Another thing is the fact that you can't hide the recommended songs that are at the bottom of each playlist. Which tends to always have the same songs on it. Which is quite annoying. Another thing is that when you search for something on a playlist, you cannot slide to the right to add to queue anymore. Which is a major time consumer now. A guy should be able to add to queue in a lot faster time than having to click song options, scroll down, and add to queue, because if there's multiple songs you'd like to add, it should take 10 seconds to add 10 songs. Not 10 seconds to add just one song. One more topic is that I have to go through multiple screens just to go to queue. Whom ever had that idea is considerably unintelligent. It used to be so simple and easy to use. Now it's like you're playing a intelligence and patience game with every user. With this new update, many things became very unnecessarily complex. My patience with this app is going quickly. I hope you fix these format issues.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-02T00:53:54-07:00

Although, sometimes when trying to listen to a specific song or artist it will recommend you a song based off of what you are listening to. Although it’s nice to branch out sometimes it’s also important to me to listen to the music I wanna hear in the moment and not similar songs. I also think that for the price premium is set at it’s not exactly worth the money. They could give more opportunities to interest more people into buying premium and not just what’s already given. Also, on some less commonly streamed songs they do not include lyrics like they would with popular songs. I get that it might be difficult to add lyrics but they should give smaller artists the same privileges as larger and more commonly known ones. Overall it’s still a great app and I love to use it to listen to both music,podcasts, and subliminal to help with sleep. There is so many different options for what you might want to listen to in the moment and I would still recommend this app to listen or publish what you like.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-02T20:42:10-07:00

But you can tell that every song’s lyrics are done by different people because if there’s cuss words some put stars after the first letter, some don’t censor it, some censor the whole thing. and sometimes the lyrics are just incorrect. for example in “lost in the citadel” by lil nas x the correct lyrics are “my god, you’re an angel” but the lyrics say “my guardian angel”. i just wish they would keep everything consistent with lyric writing. just put the whole word for everything, you don’t need to censor words for a song that is already marked explicit. also there should be a feature like apple music where it focuses on one line at a time. and if they wanna be extra fancy they could have different settings for how you want your lyrics to appear. if i’m listening to a song and really like a certain line and wanna screenshot it, i would have to crop it or circle the words which isn’t as cool looking as having one line in focus at a time. but also that should be something users can change. more settings for the way lyrics appear would be cool.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-22T06:49:10-07:00

Sometimes when I’m listening to my music, it just suddenly stops playing and when I go back to play it again, it plays from the beginning. It’ll suddenly stop playing half way through the song and when I go back to press play again, the music starts from the beginning. It’s been doing that for about a few months now and at first I thought it was maybe my headphones, but just today I wasn’t using them and the music stopped again. I’m getting really tired of this happening. Also, when it does stop and goes to the beginning, I just skip to the next song on my playlist, but then again, it does the same thing to the next song. I want this to stop! It’s super annoying and I just want to listen to my music without any problems. 

Also, when ads pop up, it gives you the option to skip them and go straight to your music. I always skip them because, to be honest, your ads are super annoying. I just close out of the app and go back in it again to play music. However, sometimes when I do skip the ads, it still plays an ad. Like, it SUPER ANNOYING and I’m getting sick of it. It gives you the option and you decide to play it anyway. Not cool. Please get back to me ASAP!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-08T12:39:00-07:00

I’ve been a premium user for a few years now on the mobile app and the Home Screen was as close to perfect as I could  have expected . I would use the top half of it 90% of the time and that was good enough because it would offer easy visual access to new music and recommendations. Very little scrolling was required due to the plethora of options that could be viewed at one time without scrolling. Now that everything is larger only 2 listening options are available to be viewed without scrolling. 2 options per scroll is a huge step backwards and it’s completely wasted space on the screen. I’m wasting time browsing through music I don’t care about when I was able to scroll twice in the past and find something interesting. The new format also randomly inserts music I’ve just listened to into the mix to fill space, which is frustrating and pointless. At least make the old format an option in the settings. This new format has made finding new music more difficult than ever and it’s unintuitive. By far the worst update the app has ever had. This isn’t going to bring anyone over from Apple Music or Pandora and I’m not sure who the target audience is for this. Senior citizens maybe?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-28T23:28:52-07:00
