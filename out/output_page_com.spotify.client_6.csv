3705938569,Please Fix üëç,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id687174333,8.4.90,5,Annoying.,"I don‚Äôt like to spend money on apps such as games and music apps but premium üôÑ. I am not buying premium. It‚Äôs just no ads and all that. Well, why can‚Äôt you just make like 10 times less ads you know, maybe it would be less annoying.
Next, why can‚Äôt I just search for songs on my playlists instead of having to scroll through my 344+ song playlist. I have a life you know! 
Also, why do the same darn ads keep coming on! I memorized some. That‚Äôs when you know they have to stop playing the same ads! 
There are more problems but those are ones that bother me the most. I have never seen an app with this many ads. 
Anyways, I rated this a 3 because I at least get music but I listen to more ads then music and I know I should buy premium but I will not because I would like to see these problems fixed.
P.S. Another problem I have is lack of skips! I need more skips for the songs I dislike. I don‚Äôt like having to go to a different playlist just to listen to another bad song or having to suffer through that song. Oh and surprise! I can‚Äôt find the song on my playlist because I cannot search it on my playlist and I am busy! 

Thank you for reading this! Please try to fix these problems as soon as possible if you can. Thank you and I am sorry to be the complainer it‚Äôs just so fustrating. Thank you!

If I want to listen to this genre of music I will definitely add it to my library, but at least respect my picks for my library/playlist and allow my brand of music that I personally choose, to play without interruptions from other types of music.

1) Downloads:
When downloading with the watch connected to a phone it for some reason just forever shows the downloading circle looping but never downloads the music. When it does download I‚Äôve had issues where I‚Äôm completely disconnected from my phone and I press play on my watch on a downloaded playlist and the play screen doesn‚Äôt update. It just never plays even though in Bluetooth my headphones are connected. Finally you can‚Äôt download single podcast episodes from the watch which is quite annoying.

2) listening 
It was a nightmare where I have a 50/50 chance of my headphones connecting to my watch when my phone is nearby. Half the time when I try to switch to my watch it just says ‚Äúfailed to connect try again later. Additionally, for some reason when I‚Äôm running disconnected from my phone after about 2-3 songs in the music just stops playing but the timer keeps going, when I press stop it goes back to the start of the song and when I press play it plays nothing but the timer ticks down and when I press pause it he same thing happens again and again until I just choose a new song or force restart.

If i didnt put it on the playlist, it means i dont want it on the playlist. Fourth, it stops playing a song in the middle of it, and when you try to keep playing it, it restarts the whole song. And finally, it has this stupid glitch where there‚Äôs no play button for the songs. I tried everything to fix it. I restarted the app, restared my phone, turning the wifi off and on again, using cellular data, but nothing worked. It wasnt something with the internet, because my other apps worked fine.

*** Edit 6/14 (Switching 4 stars to 1): When I wrote this review several months ago, I was slightly annoyed by the new GUI in the recently played. Boy, I did not realize how much worse it could get. This new update almost makes the app unusable for someone trying to find their music in any way similar to what has been standard for the last 5 years.

My second issue which is even more frustrating, if when searching for a song within a playlist, the only music it will play is within that search. My most used playlist has 270+ songs, but a search for let‚Äôs say ‚ÄúPost Malone‚Äù will bring up all matches, but when I select, it will only play ‚ÄúPost Malone‚Äù instead of other songs on the playlist. 
Third, there was a step added to opening the queue. Before, you could pull up the ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù screen and just click on queue. Another step was added, not a big deal but feel it is not needed.

5233851307,Funny girl my name ok,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id578258447,8.5.34,3,Free skips,"I love this app but I hate how I do like two skips and then it says that I have to pay for more skips but I really don‚Äôt want to. So I was wondering if you could change that or something. I know you probably can‚Äôt but it makes me really mad. But I do live this app, also some of the songs I do search on here don‚Äôt come up and I was just wondering why. Ok I Guess that‚Äôs all, I really just wanted to say something about the skips they just make me so mad when I skip two songs and there it says that I have to pay for more skips but the bad things about it is when I first got the app it was letting me have all the skips I want or it just let me pick a random song to play and now I can‚Äôt even do that, it only plays have of the song and I‚Äôm like omg nooooooo. But hopefully you read this and understand what I‚Äôm going through, and I know you need money and stuff but stilllllll come one, help a girl out. And your probably not going to read this anyway but please help meee! Thank you üôè üòä.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-04T14:37:41-07:00

3238644019,ANGfilmz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id177405568,8.4.72,1,ZERO STARS until further NOTICE!.!.!,"The last couple of updates are nothing more than a nuisance! I used to love this app, I didn‚Äôt care if it was on a premium account or free but the last few updates made using the app a little unbearable in a few ways. There‚Äôs NO LONGER a ‚ÄòMY SONGS‚Äô TAB which makes the app less pleasurable to use. I can no longer see SPECIFIC SOMGS under an artist WITHOUT HAVING to FOLLOW the artist and LIKE ALL of their songs. I literally go to my ‚ÄòARTIST‚Äô TAB and DON‚ÄôT see ANY of the songs I like, and I‚Äôm FORCED to play ALL of the artist‚Äôs songs INSTEAD of the many that I only LIKE by the artist. I DON‚Äôt want to HAVE to make a PLAYLIST every time I want to hear only 23 of the 84 tracks from a single artist it‚Äôs RIDICULOUS. It also PLAYS the EXACT same SONGS over and over even when in shuffle. The updates took over half of my songs away and I‚Äôm LIVID. And it RANDOMLY plays songs and artists that have NOTHING to do with the playlist or genre I‚Äôm TRYING to listen to. This app needs to return back to it‚Äôs former glory I‚Äôve been really fighting for this app. People try to sway me over to PANDORA but I DON‚ÄôT want to resort to using that crud.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2018-09-28T00:00:53-07:00

Over all it is a good app just please fix these problem cause it is annoying I understand you can put some good things in premium but you can‚Äôt not put music normally in premium and shuffle it on free like let a person listen to their music and they need to bring back liked songs cause I‚Äôm tired of playlists but like I said overall it‚Äôs a good app but please fix this cause it‚Äôs getting bad and I‚Äôm thinking of going into Apple Music so just please fix this and thank you, bye",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-30T13:36:04-07:00
10424558913,OnlyMe&NotYou,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id87356481,8.8.75,1,Sexist/Racist Against Women,"I used to love this app but the trashy sexist/racist artists and their garbage lyrics that belittle and have no respect for the female gender need to go. This treatment and app violates the constitution. Sorry but don‚Äôt give me the ‚Äúfreedom of expression‚Äù excuse here. An app that pushes and supports discrimination, but especially towards women is supporting a backwards society where women have been bashed and trashed since the beginning of time, and nothing has changed, and is just getting worse. Do you not have mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers? Do you not respect nor love and respect them? Apparently not. This treatment has no place in this alpha male, machismo society. It‚Äôs repulsive and hugely toxic, and is the model for future abuse of women. What the youth of today sees now paves the way for how they treat women in the future. If everyone is screaming racism these days, women should be at the very top screaming the absolute loudest. It‚Äôs about time. This app is appalling to me and turns my stomach, literally. Wish I could name these artists here. Asking Apple to remove less than stellar reviews is a known thing now. So I‚Äôll be watching.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-30T13:51:12-07:00
