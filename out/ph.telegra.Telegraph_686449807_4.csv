- works way better with bad internet service
- has a lot of features that can cover various use cases: groups, teams, 1-1 chats, storage for photos, news, etc

The bad things are:

- you can quickly find a lot if small bugs, like custom photos for your contacts turn out blur. Sharing to group with topics does not respect which topic you select and goes to general. Weird UI effects, when sometimes hard to get to exit some view without actually performing an action. 
- some things are not intuitive, so you really have to read their announcements about new features to figure out how they work. 
- update messages on app store just show the same for patch releases. 
- no watch application
