I like that the sellers have put the dimensions of items in their photos. Really helps to know the size of items. I like the size guide feature where you measure your self and the fashions actually fit!!! Sight unseen; they fit!  I enjoy finding new stuff shopping here on TEMU.

I have gotten refunds on two items because of size or I accidentally ordered a duplicate of the same product; both times they told me to keep the product so I was able to gift them to someone else. I really appreciate the updates on my order status and like the fact that it is shipped via USPS, no worries about the delivery person stealing the order, as it‚Äôs my regular mail carrier.

No joke, when I first started Farmland and Fishland for two times worth like $40 combined, I easily filled up the gauge towards completing my goal. But the closer I reached the top of the gauge, I realized I got less and less for each referral until the gauge was only going up by 0.3%‚Ä¶ Not even exaggerating.

A couple of things I bought that were under a dollar or two were kind of cheaply made but most worked well for me. 
The more higher priced items we got were just fine and most of the time 50% or more cheaper than you can get the same item from somewhere else. 
I think the only problem that I could complain about is not using boxes to ship some of their more delicate items in but I realize that‚Äôs more of a cost fro them and pricing to the customer may be more expensive. Also it can take more time to receive certain items but they are way faster than most overseas companies.

Not a big risk considering you get free shipping. 

First, I made a mistake when I put my address into their system. I typed 838 instead of 938 for my house number.  There is no house numbered 838, so I asked post office and they said it would probably be returned. 

So I went online, corrected my shipping address and ordered them a second time. 

They arrived in less than ten days. And I live love love them. Good quality, soft stretchy fabric provides ease in wearing. Lightly padded cup. Perfect. 

So I went back to my account online to say that I didn‚Äôt receive shipment, that it was my error, but that if package ever does catch up to them on a return from
Post office / would they kindly ship it back. To my utter delight, they immediately and unasked gave me a full refund.

I tried Temu because I am furnishing ‚Äúmid-term‚Äù rentals and wanted a less expensive way to furnish 3 rentals at once. However, I am very conscious of having sturdy and very functional items that hold up well. We require high quality items to make our rentals stand out above the competition. I have ordered mostly kitchen items and so far I am very pleased with the look and quality. The prices are exceptionally low which is a bonus.  I am impressed with the price guarantee and I was able to try it today. I received a refund because some of the products received had a price reduction since I placed my order. After trying some of the products I even started a Facebook page to let my friends know about Temu.

For example first person I invited got me $2, but as I got closer to the amount I needed I earned less, and the last invitee got me only $.70. Then one of the new user invitees received my invite, clicked on it and set up an account but I never received ANY credit for that and their link says ‚Äúinvite already accepted‚Äù 
The fine print says if you send too many invites or a person receives too many invites the invites become invalid but they NEVER TELL YOU what number is too many.

My two stars refer to the bold marketing. Similar to a pyramid scheme, promises of endless free gifts are presented through their mini games. Seemingly attainable, their farm, fish, dart, and hat mini games offer a free gift. To keep you hooked, while you approach your goals they tack on more ‚Äúfree gifts‚Äù. I‚Äôve successfully invited new users but to no avail. The quests become increasingly harder. The final fish food percentage drops down to a whopping .01%. You‚Äôd have to successfully invite 5-10 new users to obtain your promised free gifts. I am on the final day for fishland and I can clearly see its just a pipe dream. For the hat game they promised enough energy to flip the final card if I invited one more user. I did. And I received 1 energy as opposed to the promised amount. 

This is obviously a gimmick and their way to rake in new users to try and get more customers. While I do appreciate the deals I feel the games should stop promoting free gifts. They claim there are successful users who received all their gifts but what are the chances those aren‚Äôt just the same influencers who are promoting their invite codes. Either stop promoting free gifts or actually make them attainable.

I‚Äôve had a few issues with returns and shipping but Temu was super quick to help and make things right. I‚Äôve continued to purchase because of how happy I am with their selection, prices, and especially the customer service and deals. Functionally, the app works well and I haven‚Äôt had issues with glitches. It is kind of an endless scroll setup with unlimited recommendations that can get repetitive, but it‚Äôs fun to browse! So many unique items you can‚Äôt get elsewhere. Shipping is slow but so far everything has arrived eventually in mostly fair condition.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-28T14:05:27-07:00
10091307955,Hcjeixnwidb,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id435062171,1.81.0,3,Only good first 2 purchases,When you‚Äôre a new user you get one item for cheap and then 2 free items and your next purchase is 2 items cheap and 3 free. That is an amazing deal however don‚Äôt expect to get anything out of the games they‚Äôre incredibly RIGGED can‚Äôt tell you how many times it would tell me if I got this many points it would be complete and it wouldn‚Äôt be. Told me if I got enough coins I would get 2 dollars which would get me to my 150 reward. When I got the coins it only gave me 50 cents when it said 2 dollars so I‚Äôm still 50 cents away from the award that can only be redeemed if you invite someone that has never had the app before. It‚Äôs good for the first two purchases so make it count because you won‚Äôt get anything after like advertised. Also when you click back on a game they will advertise how to get more coins 3-4 times before it will actually let you back out.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-30T23:45:05-07:00

I had to put in my address and I didn‚Äôt get anything. I just tried inviting people and inviting people and when I got to the last person, I told me to add more five more people. do you know that‚Äôs ridiculous you know I spend hours and hours and hours on the app and it doesn‚Äôt give me nothing and people are not liking that especially my friend and also I hate the fact that he told me that I can get at least two free stuff from the app and you know what I had to do again put in my address and play a game and you know what I had to do play the game and again, and again, and again and again, and you know what I got nothing so with that type of stuff I do not like but with the other stuff it‚Äôs good that‚Äôs good customer service good shipping and stuff and yeah I just do not like the hundred dollar worth stuff for the free stuff because it‚Äôs not true in my eyes",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-24T22:49:49-07:00
