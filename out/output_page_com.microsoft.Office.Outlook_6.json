Currently, when using the mobile app, one must open each individual email to report them as junk or phishing, whereas we can select multiple messages when using an Internet browser on a non-mobile device or from the desktop client.\n\nAdditional observation, when one composes an email from the mobile app, and saves it as a draft, or sends it from the mobile app, the formatting, specifically the spacing, is off. It either doesn’t add spaces between paragraphs, or adds additional spaces between paragraphs. The formatting is correct when viewing it from the mobile app, however, the formatting doesn’t convert well from mobile to desktop.\n\nOther than that, Outlook for iOS is great.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-05T05:15:47-07:00"},{"id":"4004586740","userName":"TekkGuy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id37171665","version":"3.18.0","score":2,"title":"Very Buggy - New Releases Cannot Be Trusted","text":"I've used this app for quite a while for my business E-Mail accounts, since I like to have them separate from my personal accounts.
