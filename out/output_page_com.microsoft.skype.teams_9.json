I can do it from my laptop but it’s much more complicated from my phone. \n\nWhen I log in and hit “join” there is a drop down that lists either 2 or 4 options. Problem 1 is that there is no consistency and when I only get 2 options, I cannot select “call me” since it’s not listed. \n\nProblem 2 appears when I can see all 4 options. One is “call me” so I hit that. But then I need to select my number to call and I then get a call, so I answer the call and it tells me to press “1” if I want to join the call. Then I have to find the dial pad and press “1”.  Biggest problem is that the dial pad doesn’t recognize me pressing “1” so I am unable to join the call. It simply asks me again to press “1” even though I have already done that. \n\n(Problem 3 is that this is way too many steps to join a call, by the way!)\n\nThanks","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-11-13T07:05:07-07:00"},{"id":"6614217206","userName":"RN I kinda hate U all","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1061110723","version":"2.0.25","score":1,"title":"R U KIDDING ME????
