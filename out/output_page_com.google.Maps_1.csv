Now when I go through that same process an alternative screen comes up, but you can’t see all of the options when you’re driving so you pull over and you’re still fumbling your way through the process with extended steps to maneuver through it and ultimately wants you to open up the Google Maps app, but by the time you get there the address is completely gone and won’t transfer over to the app. This app is completely useless because it will not allow you to navigate anywhere with directions now. I’ve done all of the updates, but to no avail does this app work. I’m sure I’m not the only person to complain about this, but at this point, I’m going to have to completely delete the Google Maps app and go with an alternative solution.

I don’t need to try to sort this out after I’m on the road.  3) connection interruption with Car Play screws up the routing. If you have the “correct” route you’ve been following and say halfway there your carplay connection gets interrupted for whatever reason google maps will not display the route you were on, it will offer longer routes. No idea why it does this. You need to back up and re-set “your location” again and then ask for directions to get the original route to reappear. Again, not something that you should have to sort out when on the road.  4) very reluctant to offer alternative routes.  You can get caught up in a 30 minute delay of traffic and there are alternative routes available and it will not offer them. 5) poor judge of traffic delays based on historic data.

Only to realize that the faster one ended up not being as simple as they said, and that the slower one (+10 minutes) was only slow because for some reason it had me take side roads completely around it before arriving, when I could have simply turned directly into it from the road I was on, making it a quick trip. Not all gas stations show up in searches, it almost seems to favor the expensive gas stations. There’s doesn’t seem to be an algorithm that keeps track of the bad traffic times. It will re rout my whole trip to a significantly slower route if it senses traffic, even if that traffic is close to the end of my trip hours away and will be cleared well before I get to that point. If you’re a contractor that has to go in and out of many neighborhoods, it normally recognizes certain entrances while not recognizing others, so it will take you completely around the neighborhood 30 minutes away to the other entrance when you have just passed a perfectly good entrance that has been around forever.

I cannot tell you how many times I have just picked a direction and turned the wrong way and then had to wait on the app to re-route me when it could have been easily avoided by simply saying turn left instead of head north. I use the app a lot since I drive for a popular delivery service and when I get lost because I head north instead of south I end up being late for my delivery which lowers my tip and my rating which reduces the number of deliveries I am offered and impacts my ability to make a living all because it expects me to figure out north from south when I’m already stressed, in a hurry, and trying to arrive somewhere I’ve never been before all while being timed.

I can’t close Google Maps by swiping up and the screen can’t be dimmed by pressing the right side button. Also, the phone does not respond to attempts to shut it down and restart.  Continued pressing of the buttons to access the shutdown screen merely merely results in an whooping chirp, but no other response.  The kind of chirp tech equipment makes when it is trying to get your attention to stop doing whatever you are doing. 

If I disconnect the phone from the car and put it in my pocket, after awhile the screen will go dark and the phone becomes usable again.  Until the phone’s screen dims, it is unusable. The first time it happened, when I got access to the screen again, I shut the phone down and restarted hoping that it was one time random problem that could be fixed with reboot. Nope, the problem is back again.

Lately this app has been getting worse. It’s either not updated with the latest mapping, or my biggest issue is major problems with the navigation. 1. It changes routes automatically after I’ve manually selected a different route than the primary one suggested. It will do this mid-navigation without asking so I have no idea. 2. It typically does this with toll routes. It will always reroute you to the most expensive toll route even if there’s a non-toll route that is similar ETA or significantly shorter (sometimes 30min). 3. When it does prompt a confirmation to change routes mid-navigation, I’m unable to see what the new route is before accepting. I’ve had it suggest a shorter route and accepted the change only for it to be 15-20 min longer. 4. I’ve had issues lately with it dropping the destination pin in the wrong location. Most notably, it dropped me on the wrong side of a water canal where’s there’s no access to the other side by foot. 5. I continue to have issues with the audio speaking incorrect directions (I.e. the voice says turn right but the map shows a left turn). 

It’s been a frustrating user experience especially on long road trips. I like the layout of google maps better than Apple, but if this poor navigation continues, I’ll be forced to switch.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-27T05:23:17-07:00

It’s was alright and took us about 4 and half hours, but when we were going back it’s showed me two routes 7 and 8 hours. I was confused because we only drove 4… but I was completely sure everything will be alright, that’s my buddy google maps I can rely on.

That’s the other thing, it gives you directions literally the moment you need them. When you drive, if it says go left, you turn left and it tells you your next street and turn to look for and the distance before you reach it. In cycling mode, in the same scenario, it would say turn left as you reached the street and continue to say turn left until you reach your next turn. So you have no idea at all what to look for, can’t anticipate anything, and you’re basically riding blind between each step. And if you miss a step, it automatically re routes you, so I rode about three miles uphill needlessly in the rain yesterday because I couldn’t hear my phone over the road and rain noise, nor had any idea what turn to look for, when to look for it, or how to rectify all of those failures in real time, I was pretty much being led astray in the pouring rain by an app that doesn’t have any of these problems in driving mode…",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-12T05:55:44-07:00

There was a time when this app would give you turn by turn navigation, after you made a turn it would indicate the next regardless of distance, so you could anticipate the next set of directions and change lanes accordingly. A few updates ago they removed this feature for who knows why. Initially it wasn't a big deal because you could simply zoom out quickly to see the next turn yourself. Now they have made it so sensitive if you touch the screen or attempt to move the map to see where to go next it starts spinning wildly and fighting whatever you try and do to see the location you are going towards. For example you are driving straight and are going to make a left turn in 1 mile and  the address is only 1.2 miles away. So you think “okay I can zoom out a bit to see if the business is on the left or right side of the road after the turn” WRONG if you try to slide the map further to see where to go it will start orienting itself in opposition of what you are trying to do. Zoom in, zoom out, and flip your always North facing settings for no apparent reason.

Maps only communicates in NSEW directions “Head East” (Who knows that?),  the voice notification system is mediocre at best, and to say that Google Maps is glitchy is an understatement. I just went to a new city and drove my car around, and more often than not I was slinging my car across four lanes of traffic trying to make an exit that Google didn’t let me know I needed to take, or saying that I was on the wrong side of the road, going the wrong way or off the road entirely into the bushes (all the while I had at least 3 bars of LTE on Verizon.

Presumably I should have been able to opt out of that new route but that button never appeared on my screen. When I selected to see my route in written steps, the screen often froze and wouldn’t let me return to the map view. A pop up window kept appearing to ask permission to access my contacts (no!) and there was no way to exit or escape that screen. I pulled over 6-7 times during a 3 hour drive to clear the map and start over, including one time when I deleted then reloaded the app entirely in hopes of getting it to behave, but still had to fiddle with it too much while driving. With all those problems, I was never confident the instructions it was speaking was the route I wanted, but if I exited from spoken instructions (when that wasn’t frozen) to verify my location on the map, I risked forgetting to restart the spoken step by step and wasn’t corrected when I missed a turn.

Add to this, that it is ALWAYS, at MINIMUM 20 minutes longer and $15 more expensive to go into NJ and take the George Washington Bridge into New York City from where I start, as opposed to staying on the thruway and taking the Tap (Cuomo, whatever 🙄) and yet it has gone as far as telling me to turn around to backtrack, AS IM PASSING THE BRIDGE! In other words, I ignore the directions, proceed into the city, and when I’m already in the Bronx, this app wants me to get on the bridge to Jersey (no toll), just to turn around to take it back, AND PAY A TOLL!

I had to drive another mile to turn around and drive into the CORRECT destination without the help of google maps. (It’s funny bc it will never ask me to rate those drives).

I switched to iPhone last year and was used to pressing a map link and it opened right up in maps. Well, apple does that too...but when I needed it badly I had to come download google maps. I was stuck in a delivery parking lot of a huge hospital in an unfamiliar city that apparently had one address for the whole campus. Apple's map made me almost lose my mind- ""Turn right then turn right! Go southwest then immediately go north then turn right! Turn left then turn right!""
It was insanity.
I finally broke down and googled what I needed which prompted me to download Google Maps...And I was immediately given correct directions and found my medical office in less than 5 minutes. Now every time I need directions I find Google Maps is the only one that's accurate.
4 stars because it turns me sideways sometimes and did have me turn right off of an exit just to make an immediate u-turn when it should have just told me to turn left from the jump. Still- it gets me there which is what I ultimately care about.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2017-11-13T04:28:47-07:00
4466300054,Royal Montgomery,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id141776519,5.21,3,Not very good or accurate,"Google Maps is helpful, probably, when one is driving. It's not helpful for someone who has to take transit or walk. Transit often has changes/transfers - there are no actual walking directions available that are helpful. If you're walking the wrong way, the app doesn't stop you, just tells you to walk to {location}. Also, some bus stops are very near/across the street from one another and Google Maps has a hard time pinpointing that. That's the difference between going the wrong way in a strange place or arriving at your destination.
I commute to work but Google Maps only shows one route instead of any route, no matter how I change the settings, so I never know when the bus comes. I know when the trolley comes, but it only runs twice an hour when I am out of work and being able to see any kind of alternate route would be nice. I've also noticed that we have a trolley line that runs all the way to South Hills Village, but Google Maps just tells you to get off the stop before that and walk for sixteen minutes. I know better, but a person new to the area may not. I just don't find it very helpful as someone who doesn't drive.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-15T10:20:08-07:00
2117347055,Gregory Lerner,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id43573115,4.44,4,Almost perfect (almost),"For the vast majority of usage, this app has been flawless. The traffic is accurate, the routing is good, and the user interface is simple and easy to use. However, I have found some things to be quite annoying. For one, I have found that sometimes when I am in the far left lane on the highway, the app will think I am on the wrong side of the road causing it to constantly reroute me (this mostly happens in HOV lanes and high speed ezpass lanes). 

Another issue is that if I purposely choose a slower route because it is fewer miles the app will constantly tell me it found a faster route (I know there is a faster way, but I purposefully chose the longer timed route!) this is very frustrating, and on my last 2 hour drive it told me 5 times that there was a faster way and I had to take my hand off the wheel to cancel the change.

Finally, my last complaint is that there aren't more alternate routes given. I’m lucky if the app gives me 3 options, whereas online you can drag the route to any road and it will find a route. Other than these issues though, the app is very well implemented.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-22T22:30:23-07:00

All areas that are white should be reversed and made black and vis versa. My girlfriend recently used Google Maps to find an address in Long Island City. The directions given were a very long way having her cross over train tracks and walk by strip clubs where people around there thought she must have worked there. I would think that Google Maps would give you safe directions. Once to her location she asked for a safer rout and they were able to give here much safer directions to get back. Please do a better job at directions... This should never have happened in the first place. ** GLITCH: I’m using Google Maps and plugged in an address. It correctly puts a pin where the address is but where the blue circle says I am the blue directional radar where I am pointing is in the completely incorrect direction. I have to go NORTH and am pointing my iPhone North however Google Maps says I’m pointing SOUTH. If I did not know for sure I was going in the correct direction Google Maps would lead me away from my destination.

1972813079,KarenD345,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id543096793,4.41,4,Only sometimes shows the saved locations on my phone,"I wrote a review a while back that the app no longer showed saved locations making it cumbersome to go to ‘home’ or ‘work’ since those saved locations do not show up in ‘recent searches’. I am very impressed that google responded to my review and fixed the issue. Unfortunately, the fix is not entirely 100% and the app now is rather temperamental about whether or not it shows the stored locations. It seems that if you still have a route displayed and then want to change it, the app won’t show stored locations but when you start from the map/satellite image of your current location, it will. 

Previous review: Used to work beautifully for the daily commute from/to work/home because of real-time traffic. Now, however, when picking a destination it only shows recent searches and not saved locations like home or work. It’s irritating and defeats the purpose of having stored locations. Yes, I do know the usual way home but the whole purpose of using google maps is to know the best route given the current traffic situation",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-05T08:57:21-07:00

If you’re looking for directions without a custom map and for only one destination, this map is for you. If you create your own maps, need to look up multiple destinations, or are on a trip, it’s near impossible. First of all, I had my mom send me the link to our custom map. It send to my gmail, no problem. Then I’d click on the map, and it either wouldn’t load, or take me to Safari. The Safari view would show the map, but decline to let you get directions unless you signed in. Okay. I signed in. Well, it took my back to my home address, and sent me on a infinite loop, going from clicking the link in my email, getting sent to safari, logging in, and losing the map. I had to redownload the app four times before it worked. Second of all, the map legend isn’t interactive. I’m going to new york, and spent six hours working on a custom map, with a pin for every single place I wanted to go. i downloaded the app, only to find that in the map legend, you can’t click on individual icons, forcing you to leave the map legend, and click on every single icon until it pops up.

Last week I called to confirm that a used vehicle was available before we went to the dealership. I was told it was, but when I arrived it turned out a deposit was paid on it even though it was still present on the lot, so it was not in fact available. I had been considering the new option of the same vehicle as well, so I test drove that for about 10 minutes and said yes, let's buy. My fiancé and I proceeded to wait for hours to make the sale - in total it took FIVE HOURS at the dealership to purchase the vehicle.

Halfway through signing paperwork, I questioned the lender and was told ""Oh wait, that's a mistake, sign this instead"" and that it was in fact a different lender. My insurance agent called to confirm a few days later that it was the 2nd lender. Now, I'm receiving communication from the first lender and when I called the financial manager at AutoNation to find out what's going on, he claims to not remember my paperwork being messed up or any interaction about lenders at all, with me or my insurance agent. I'm now contacting these financial companies myself to find out where my loan is, and redoing my insurance. I would NEVER work with this dealership again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-25T16:02:36-07:00

I’ve been using Google navigation for about the last three years. Google maps are great. If you’re sitting in your house planning some thing but the navigation is horrible. It never shuts up. I wish there was a pro version or an intelligent version for people who understand to turn at the next street and don’t have to be reminded five times before I get there, if you were trying to listen to music in the background, forget it, turn it off there’s just no point as this app talks so much you will never hear your music. And phone calls in the background you can’t have a phone call with anybody as this app constantly is talking to you louder than the phone call telling you to turn it the next street five times before you get to the next street. 

It does have its good points as it is more accurate than Apple Maps is, but it does take me to the wrong house once in a while. 

If there was a version for intelligent drivers, as I mentioned earlier, that would be a great Google app. For now I’m going back to Tom Tom. I think.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-21T05:17:50-07:00

Like a month or so ago you would hit go and instead of automatically starting your route it would proceed to tell you how the traffic patterns are normally and how it is now....thanks I could care less and I don’t need the extra step.  Now there’s a bug where you hit star over and over and nothing happens so you need to slide that bar up which then shows you the traffic pattern times (really wanna shove that stupid feature down our throats huh google?) and then hit start.  And now it seems to have issues finding the most common of cities saying it can’t find a way there.  Best thing I can recommend is wait it out and once google has fixed all the bugs and things seem stable, shut off the auto updates for this app.  They tinker with it way too much and you never know what the next problem is gonna be.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-05T16:26:26-07:00

So we tried to give different solutions as we all only had credit cards. She still was adamant that she couldn’t. After inspecting the bill, we noticed there were too many drinks on it so we asked her to delete the extras. She said she could do that. So… if she could delete an item, couldn’t she delete items and do split checks for us? Of course she said no! I asked who the owner was because this was just getting crazy. Then she said SHE was the owner! She knew how the whole time and just would not! Why?? She blamed us for not saying we needed split checks when we sat down!! Then she threatened to call the police on us! We were literally trying to pay the bill!! She was loud! The whole restaurant heard everything!
