There is nothing from Microsoft mentioning this horrible design and no solutions. If you want to download it, then good luck explaining to your boss why you can‚Äôt send or receive any emails, or join a Microsoft Teams Meeting. 

Read it and weep, this app is actually so bad. Firstly, if you get locked out of an email, virtual machine, whatever‚Ä¶ say you get a new phone and you want to sign into your outlook emails for example‚Ä¶ well, you need the Authenticator app to get into the email. 

Okay‚Ä¶ but you need the email to get into the Authenticator app. 

This is where the logic breaks. The email will ask you to type a code in your Authenticator app to log in to the email. But the Authenticator app will ask you to log into your email to use the Authenticator app. 

So you get stuck in a loop of the Authenticator app asking you to use the Authenticator app in order to use the Authenticator app to authenticate the email that is asking you to use the Authenticator app which then asks you to use the Authenticator app in order to use the Authenticator app to authenticate the email that is asking you to use the Authenticator app which then asks you to use the Authenticator app in order to use the Authenticator app to authenticate the email that is asking you to use the Authenticator app which then asks you to use the Authenticator app in order to use the Authenticator app to authenticate the email that is asking you to use the Authenticator app which then asks you to use the Authenticator app in order to use the Authenticator app to authenticate the email that is asking you to use the Authenticator app which then asks you to‚Ä¶ 

And there, that‚Äôs why the Microsoft Authenticator app makers are paycheck thieves. A fresh college grad would have immediately saw the faulty logic loop with some simple QA. 

Like‚Ä¶ did any of them ACTUALLY TEST the app? Why are there no options for a recovery email? No options for a 2-step verification code to be texted? How about a simple phone number to call someone about this? NOPE. 

Just more links and URLS that redirect to unhelpful and unrelated Microsoft support pages. 

Also, any helpful threads or ‚Äúsupport‚Äù from the Microsoft pages does not mention this loop. A whole lot of people are having this problem and it is not being addressed, the issue of this loop can barely be searched, it‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs purposefully hidden while the company tries to fix their embarrassing mistake and pretend that everything is fine.
