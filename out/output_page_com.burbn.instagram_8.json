I have been a user since 2014, a lot has changed since. I actually have a great idea for Instagram and I think a majority of us with public accounts can agree; we need an option to prevent being added to a group chat of people who you don‚Äôt follow/they don‚Äôt follow us. I have been put in places with illegal immigrants adding me to group-chats and sending pornographic images of girls/men etc: I am 14, so this is a huge problem. I could get in a lot of trouble for possessing these images. I normally block everyone in the group-chat and leave and ignore the request. But it would be cool if you can make an option called ‚ÄúGroup Chat Request‚Äù where someone who doesn‚Äôt follow you and you don‚Äôt follow them cannot add you to a groupchat without a permission request. If you decline it, you cannot be in it. Or make it like Snapchat: If you don‚Äôt have them as a friend they cannot add you. Plus a lot of bot accounts and fake accounts make these groupchats to sell child porn/and or get you to tap a link that brings you to a porn site to see them live stream.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-08-21T07:53:49-07:00"},{"id":"4802652455","userName":"insta_sucks_do_better","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id231523482","version":"111.0","score":3,"title":"Adicting","text":"I love this app. I spend more time than I‚Äôd like to admit, on this app. That being said, the ability to have your issues heard by the company itself is seemingly impossible.

I noticed in lieu of gay pride month, Instagram created rainbow hashtags for any positive hashtag concerning the lgbqt+ community. Now I respect the lqbqt+ community and I have no ill-will against them... but this causes me to question your motives as a social media platform; because no other minority gets this sort of undying support. Why does it take a month about gay pride for you all to create a positive place for a minority? Where is this energy during black history month... why aren‚Äôt all positive hashtags regarding the African American community in Pan African pride colors? This to me, is a form of downright disrespect because how can you have such strong ties and beliefs to one Minority but not any other. I‚Äôm leaving this horrible review not only for my race, but for all races and minorities. You cannot call yourself a social platform welcoming to all when you are selective on whom you wish to represent. Gay people were not the only Minority that was put through years of terror from America, so why is it that they are the only ones being acknowledged. I don‚Äôt only blame Instagram because the same is for any social media site, but the hashtags brought to my attention how racism is still strong dividing force in America.

All of my buddies have received this update, but I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôve made an effort to be patient and to fix the problem. I tried upgrading the app numerous times, restarting my phone, updating my phone, deleting the app, logging out of my account, and nothing worked. No option for music on my notes. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm being left out.I‚Äôm disappointed that Instagram would reject someone like this, and I‚Äôm upset altogether. Please provide me this update; I‚Äôd appreciate it. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pleasant to be left out of your updates, and I have no idea why you choose to leave out someone like me. But it‚Äôs unfair, and I‚Äôd like to know about this development as soon as possible. I don‚Äôt deserve this update, so kindly give it to me. It‚Äôs quite disrespectful and disgusting of you to ignore me. I truly want this update, and I‚Äôm furious that you excluded me from it and all the other upgrades you‚Äôve done.

I call it the ‚Äúblack layout‚Äù because no matter what your phone color settings are on, the layout is black. The feed with this layout is absolutely horrible. It shows me one post of someone I follow and then the rest are random accounts I‚Äôve never seen before and it‚Äôs all videos that you can‚Äôt mute. The regular scrolling we are used to and that makes actual logical sense is gone, and it‚Äôs now this weird, choppy mess where nothing flows. Oh and captions now appear on the posts rather than below them, so if you‚Äôre a photographer and the entire photo is important to see, you might as well delete the app. I get it, insta is dying and trying to revive itself by becoming tik tok but instagram isnt tik tok and shouldn‚Äôt try to be. This new format is very obviously a horribly executed attempt to look like tik tok, but all it‚Äôs achieved is polarizing basically everyone who has ever used and liked instagram. It‚Äôs almost like the people at instagram said, how can we make the worst app update to ever exist, and make sure our audience deletes it? I‚Äôd say they exceeded those expectations. It‚Äôs unusable and I am deleting the app after having it since the beginning.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-04T10:25:12-07:00"},{"id":"7648295944","userName":"Lps silver wolf","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id429112898","version":"199.0","score":4,"title":"The recent update..","text":"Like most other instagram users, I‚Äôve had the app for a long time. The app itself is great and perfect to use but the one thing I complain and dislike about it is the recent update. I have two accounts, one of them having the reel and shopping option at the bottom of the screen and the other post and likes. Unfortunately my other account has updated itself. I absolutely hate that the reels and shopping option is right there at the bottom. I wish that there‚Äôs an option that we could change how we want it, or update it back to the original because it‚Äôs so annoying. It was perfectly fine how it was but now, why change it?? There are some things that needed to be updated but never the layout on how it was before. PLEASE change it back, I can tell you that 95% of the instagram users hate how the bottom section is designed.

They would have paid off Drs to defend cigs (they did) and silenced everyone. \nIf it were in the time of social media even if your Dad died of second hand smoke and you could prove it the act of posting this would have caused you to be blocked with no way to defend yourself.

They need to bring back showing us posts in order of when they were posted, not an order of who they think we want to see. They also need to stop censoring. I want to see every post from everyone and following, not just ones you think I‚Äôm interested in. Also, stop trying to make this the shop for people. We don‚Äôt want to buy things on Instagram, we want to connect with our friends and family. The new update makes it really hard to post a photo or see who liked and commented, but really easy to go to the explorer page and go to the shopping page. Stop trying to make a huge profit and just let us enjoy this app. If there is one update that they should add, let us delete a single photo on a multi photo post. Sometimes I post one post with three photos at a time and then realize one of those photos needs to be taken off. I would have to delete the entire post and I‚Äôm not reposting something once all my friends have seen it.

I hope a developer can assist me in getting the app back, but currently the app is useless, and seeing that no one has helped this far into the issue, I simply would not recommend this app to anyone based solely off of their lack of acknowledgement to my problem. I understand I am one user of many, but if they truly cared about their users they would help.

I can go back onto my feed and insta-story camera but the entire DM page is black. A second glitch that has also been occurring and is still occurring is false notifications on my other accounts. I have three accounts linked to my Instagram and each one gets notifications regularly and I check each one. But just as I had checked them, it still shows as if the notification had never been checked. The notifications range from likes, comments, and DMs do idrk whats up with that. I have a feeling it may be the newest IOS update but even if it is, there should be something that can fix this because I keep having to exit out of the app and entering in again.
