The company (from what I‚Äôve seen) does not try to precedent scammers from getting on their app. Scammers are evolving. Telling your customers what to look for is no longer enough. As a company, you all need to put resources into coming up with strategies to prevent scammers from using your app. It‚Äôs not just up to your customer to weed out scammers on a service you provide. People who use these apps are looking for employment and to charger for a premium service is a bit odd. We are trying to find employment to make money. Not spend money to hopefully get employment. It‚Äôs becoming very disappointing with all of the hiring apps.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-06T11:46:47-07:00
