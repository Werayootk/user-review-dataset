This persistent notification not only clutters my notification bar but also serves as a constant, unwelcome reminder of the app's presence on my device.

Despite going through all available settings and even reaching out to support, the issue persists with no solution in sight. This oversight in design or functionality oversight shows a lack of consideration for user preferences and autonomy, making it hard to recommend LinkedApp to others.
