I thought i would hate it and a bunch of worse things would have happen. After time i began to love it so much i have over 1k and i have a little issues but i’m fine with this not being fixed “as soon as possibly”. So one of the problems are the for you page, once and blue moon you’ll get on it, (unless your super lucky) and i would work so hard for it and never get on it, i came to think of it as in just not quality video enough for it and that’s alright! Another thing is i like to find random small accounts and like atleast 30 of their videos good or bad, but i can’t do it as often now we have a “limit” on likes and comments (which i think is really dumb). I have one last issue and that is that videos are being deleted for no reason!!! i had a really popular one of mine deleted and it made me super upset even tho it didn’t have anything wrong with it. Same for live streams innocent people get suspended because a 9 year old reported them. Thank you for taking the time to read this! I would love it if you could atleast fix one of these problems!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-11T22:49:55-07:00

STOP I SAID.  Whatever.  Keep reading then. I could do this all day. Taping away on my phone, wasting time we both could be spending enjoying TikTok. Wait is it TicTok or TikTok? Did you look?  Are you sure you’re not reading some review of a knock off app? Nevermind, it’s TikTok. Pretty sure.

If you’re still reading this congrats.  Only 2.1% of readers make it this far. And believe me, there is much much more to come.  Up next...actually there isn’t. This has been fun, for both of us, but it’s getting ridiculous, right? I mean, what is the point of this? Why, oh Lord, why? Why won’t he stop? And by ‘he’ I mean me. Ok, that’s it. I’m calling it.  Once you start referring to yourself in the third person, it’s time to...do some other thing, or something.  I don’t know.  I never said I was good at reviews. Oh, right.  The review.  TikTok is good.  How’s that?  Believable?  It is true too.

I guess there was a lot more after all. Sorry about that.  In conclusion, if you read this far, maybe TikTok isn’t for you after all.  Instead, make some human friends.  Peace.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-29T17:53:10-07:00

I’ve always noticed if there is any type of nudity or inappropriate content, it gets taken down immediately -however recently I have seen some disgusting things, such as a mans lower body part, a women who’s completely naked on a slideshow, and there’s even a trend where women take their shirts off and flash the camera. I’ve reported every one of these videos, yet I get a notice saying the guidelines had not been broken. what? I just looked down at my phone in complete disgust. I see so many videos about how tiktok doesn’t even take nudity down anymore, and I wholeheartedly agree. TikTok was a fun, safe app for kids and teens and now it’s like a porn site. It is insane that I’ve reported at least 10 videos with clear adult porn in them, whether it’s a women’s chest or a man’s penis. It’s EXTREMELY wrong and gross for tiktok to take down a 15 year old girl swimming with her friends but not grown women flashing the camera. There are kids on this app, and if they want to do that then TikTok is not the place-and although the change needs to be with them too, it needs to start with the Tiktok team and whoever is in charge of the guidelines, because they’ve clearly given up",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-23T18:53:40-07:00

I’ve also blocked this one tiktoker that just makes my blood boil.. she makes stupid TikTok's of her face moving in weird ways. And then I realized that a lot of people don’t like her too, so they will download her videos and make fun of them on their own. Their are too many people doing this to block and I don’t know what to do other than say not interested. AND IT GIVES ME MORE VIDEO’S AND MORE OF HER!!! I feel like this app is trying to go against me and fight me. Maybe I’m just bad at using technology or something like that but I hate that. second of all, every time it updates and stuff like that, it deletes my profile picture and sets the setting on light mode. For some reason, seeing light mode makes me want to throw my phone across the room! I HATE IT!!!! And now it wont give me the thing in setting (setting of this app) to let me put it on dark mode.

the second account that was blocked (same scenario), i lost two very precious and irreplaceable videos of my Paw Paw. he passed away recently. those were videos and memories i’ll never get back. it’s a shame, really.  all because some keyboard bully wanted to hurt me personally and hurt my business as far as keeping me from advertising and it worked— twice. i URGE someone to kook deeper into complaints about accounts before they’re just deleted with no warning to the account owner because some random “user” reported that something was wrong with it. there are always two sides to a story. and to block and delete a 39 year old woman’s TikTok account containing nothing but videos of sublimation printing and my family, well, that p!seed me off. bad. all because one person felt like being petty.

You may think it’s an app for kids but... this app can get you in a LOT of trouble. The reason why I say that is because you have to think before you talk or do anything . If you DONT people will cancel you and send you death threats.  And you won’t even have any time to apologize. On TikTok there is a group of careless teenage boys called “The Boys” and they cyber bully EVERYONE that is a poc/minority, lgbtq, or have a disability. If they see that you are one of them they will send you messages that are very harming. Not only that but this app can be very addicting you start to forget about your school work, friends, and even your family. You talk less with the people you love and know and person, because you’re always obsessed with your videos getting 100+ likes and trying to not get yourself shadow banned. Also I think TikTok should remove the videos for being our pfp because they are the main ones to not get taken down unless you have a lot of people reporting it. This app should not be for kids that are 12 or younger, because they be involved in cp or any other dangerous activities. I don’t think this is a good app, and I would be more than happy if this app were to be taken down.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-11T10:42:57-07:00

You can add videos to your favorites and even make collections out of them. You can see the history of comments you’ve made and videos you’ve seen. My only problem is that one of my favorite and recent features has been removed from my TikTok. This month TikTok added this recording feature which many call “story mode”. Many users have commented on this feature on how much they love it and appreciate TikTok adding this feature! However, more recent to this, TikTok has removed this feature for many users. Including me. When recording videos to post or even just for myself I like features and filters that make me look flattering. Story mode had a specific camera function and cropping that changed the way it looked when recording. Simply cropping it isn’t the same as already recording with it. I’m hoping that you’ll bring it back or reply to me with a solution to this, but I thought it’d be best to bring this to your attention.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-30T00:40:15-07:00

But you know what I don't love? The moderation. The system is either too harsh or not harsh enough, in just the past two days I've reported 7 different things that VERY MUCH violate the guidelines, and once it has been ""reviewed"" it was shown to have apparently not violated the guidelines. There is too much that the dev team lets the community get away with, and I understand that staff shouldn't be subjected to troubling and disturbing content but it reaches a certain point that there isn't any other choice than to have staff review reports. Not taking action against this issue is what enables people to continue violating your guidelines and until action is taken, people won't stop. To be able to make your platform a safe place, you need to hold your community accountable when it is actively hurting itself, and until you make it known that you're going to be taking action, people will continue abusing the lost reporting system.

There is a way you can be famous and you can see funny videos that Vine never had. So I do have one complaint and that is that tiktok does take up a little more space on my phone then I want but then again TikTok can’t be perfect. There is something called a “For You” spot on the top of your screen people might talk about it a lot they might comment on a video saying something like “FYP!!” They are referring to the For You page. If you open the app it will most likely take you to the FYP, on the for you page there is stuff that tiktok thinks you would like to see.( such as funny videos or art videos) if you double tap your screen on a video then that’s how you can like a video, to follow them you can click the plus under their pfp ( profile picture) then you can go to the “Following” page at the top and there you can see the content that the people you post.

The comment section is that you and others that saw the same video can comment on it you can like others comments and you can also follow content creators by clicking the red plus underneath their profile pictures. You can also go to their page my swiping left. You can share the video too to some friends by clicking the arrow at the bottom and choosing what person you want to send the video to! You can also make videos people can like, comment, or follow you as well! That’s all I’m gonna tell you you’ll find the rest on your own.

While yes, this gives me a chance to fix any mistakes in the previous cosplays i had, i still want to be able to go back later and see the progress i have made. So can you keep the drafts there just maybe put them under a security thing? So that if you have to lock them in case you get hacked or my situation happens nothing will happen to the drafts? 
My other problem is that you guys have a set up for notifications from what users we want to see. So i enable the notifications on a few of them but i never get notifications despite seeing their content later. I set up notifs on my gf so i can support her and gets others to support her to but anytime she uploads, i never get a notif.

Also, I wish (like with your watch history) you could have a select all button and delete all your comment history. (You have to manually go to each video and delete it. Another thing is if I search up something, for example, once I searched up a pin/button maker because I was interested in buying one. The first 2 maybe 3 videos were about a pin/button maker, but the rest were completely random and literally had nothing to do with what I searched. Then it brings me to a page that says “others recently searched” and then the options are, ex: “button maker green” or “button maker how to use” and there’s no point because even if I click on one of those, again, it shows me three videos related to the topic then shows me the most random videos.

The problem is, TikTok shadowbans us. Our content is not shown to the world, causing our hard work and efforts to go down the drain. I have to constantly keep making new accounts so people can see my content. You shouldn’t shadowban people for using the same tags over again multiple times. It makes it clear what its from, what character, what the video’s about, etc. 
I’ve had to take down videos and reupload because you shadowban my account and nothing is shown to anyone. Even after reuploading, it never seems to get anywhere either. 
I spend SO much money for this and you trash it like it’s nothing. Its cruel how you do this. As much as I may hate the app for this, I still remain on it because of how happy it can make me sometimes. It gets hard to enjoy it when all you do is shadowban and delete my content. It’s unfair and disgusting. 
At least let us KNOW before you go ahead and block all of our content. Like, give us cosplayers a warning, and then we’ll start using different tags, or calming down on our posts a little. We aren’t spamming the hashtag or making inappropriate tiktoks, we’re making our cosplays known. It’s insanely difficult to do that because of this, and it angers me, as well as many others, a lot.

 i DO NOT recommend getting this app for anyone UNDER the age of 13-14 if you are considering getting this app for your child who is under that age PLEASE DO NOT. there are things on there that they should not be seeing/be exposed to that young. such as porn/nudity, constant negativity, politic wars, body checking, ED promotion, toxic beauty/body standards, SH, gore and much much more. not only that it tends to have an effect of making them grow up too quickly.

 if you are above/around 13-14 or older i would recommend , it is great to help pass time as well as to keep yourself entertained (if it doesn’t get repetitive of course)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-14T02:22:46-07:00

It is fun, it’s easy, and the communities you create are fantastic. Also I love that there is gifting within the app. The is a but however.... There seems to be issues with TT’s reporting process. For example, I had a video reported and taken down because it “violated” TT’s guidelines. I’ve read their guidelines twice and it does not. It also seems that you can report someone for any reason, and even if it is not true, that person can lose their “go live” privileges, or even a temporary ban. There should be an appeal process with TT admins and someone to speak to regarding these issues. Also, while some accounts are getting banned or having features temporarily turned off for no apparent reason, there are bully accounts growing a rapid rates. These accounts depict hate towards veterans, the disabled, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, etc. it breaks my heart every time I run into these accounts and see how they mistreat the helpless. SHAME on TikTok for not having a better system to address this. I really hope I can come back and give 5 stars in the future.

It keeps all of your notifications, even if you log out if your account, so you’re always protected. Honestly, even if it was stealing my information and running even when i shut the app out, I don’t care. I open my phone with my finger print. Now, most people open their phones with their faces too. Who cares?? Our information was being stolen by the government in the first place 😹🙈✨ Anyways, i really enjoy the app, 10/10, I’ll use it until it shuts down.

Just to scroll through videos and one of my favorite parts of tiktok is when you hit the follow button then go to the next page you can see only the videos of the people you follow I also like this app because some things people say are very nice like.. this person send you this video to say you are beautiful! Witch is so kind and it’s not like you are scrolling through videos that are 20 mins long they only let you film 60 sec or a min or 15 sec for songs so yes I highly recommend this!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-16T10:06:55-07:00

It’s so much fun making videos and watching other people make funny content. In this app you can express who you are . And it’s different from other social media apps which is 👍. I also enjoy how the videos are short and you don’t spend 30 minutes watching one video and I hate scrolling through random photos on instagram, although I still do. In TikTok you just post videos. I also like that you can choose from many videos that express who you are, for example if your into art you watch art videos. If your into comedy you watch funny videos. My favorite thing about TikTok is the dances, you can learn them(which is fun), post them, make your own, and you might become TikTok famous!!! So yeah this is my favorite app, and I hope 🤞 it lasts forever ♾. The only thing is that sometimes there’s this funny part to the video I went to just go to it, at first I try to rewind or skip ahead but it doesn’t work. What I think TikTok should add is a rewind or skip button. Also, I hate when TikTok says “your scrolling to fast” and doesn’t let you like.

I think that tik tok she give every account a chance to be on the for you page of different people. And also I think there should be a dislike button regards sending hate comments. Also the reporting problem. Far to many people report accounts for no reason. A lot of my favorite tik tok creators are suspended because of numerous reports that make no sense.

There are way too many people who get offended by little things. For example, I made a video simply following a trend of doing a certain dance aggressively. Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for ""being rude to the creator of the dance"" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was ""under review"" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They're just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don't receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers. Tik Tok also seems to tend to give my less successful videos way too many likes, which have a horrible like:view percentage. These views should instead go to the content that people like more.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-02T00:26:46-07:00

Every single one of their products can be found on AliExpress! Want to how you can find out? Take a screenshot and reverse image search one AliExpress. I’ve seen water bottles, sun lamps, lighters, hello kitty phones, counterfeit Sanrio products CONSTANTLY being pushed through the sponsored ads. Idk how tiktok processes their applicants for ads, but this is super ridiculous. I don’t even know if anything is done with the reports I make because I’m not foolish enough to fall for the scams, and because they don’t give updates on the ads you report. If Tiktok doesn’t come up with a better way to handle this, I can see the company in very deep trouble in the long run.

As a woman that really doesn’t want to interact with stupid children, it’s a step in the right direction to add an adults only feature. What really needs work on is the false reporting that happens that salty people make. Not that it’s happened to me, but I know people who have truly been falsely reported for “minor safety” and “this is a minor.” Really, you make a video that doesn’t agree with a certain group of people, and it’s like a flock of angry Karens get unleashed on you.

If there is a way to change age cause I seem to not be able to change it to my real age. Can you add a gmail verification for age or another way to make it so you can’t just do one mistake then have to wait years till you can have the ability to do stuff. And another note in my opinion after realizing my mistake I looked over my account and saw the limit you guys put on these accounts and they are most unreasonable for the age I have put so as well with the verification problem can you guys put leisure for the older kids are like 12yo allow them to have some leisure but not too much and allow 15yo or 16yo’s to have people allowed to comment on their own videos cause that’s a bit much cause they’re already adults practically or be acting like it by now. I’m rating it a 3 due to some other problems but overall it’s a great app and I hope y’all actually take time to read this and not have a bot say “go here for help” like that’s not really what I want so overall again great app and a bit addictive,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-07T04:36:11-07:00

When I’m scared I just go on there an it makes my forget about it. And TikTok is the most fun app in the word it’s so cool with the cool effects and you get to stream your self and stuff. But there’s no other app were you can do that bc instagram you really only post pics of your self and that’s boring!! TikTok there’s funny vids and funny pranks and I most people love it so muchhh bc millions of people memories millions of dances. And TikTok is like has cool stuff bc when you go live people sent gift points to you. And even the names of the gift point are cool like,I am very rich,TikTok,rainbow puke,concert and other cool things. And when you go live and you don’t want to see the comments and stuff you can swipe to the left. And TikTok has there own emojiiiissss!!!! Even grandmas go on it bc it’s so fun and TikTok gives you special tip like how to skate bord how to fake cry how to do your nails and cool stuff like that and if TikTok gets band i don’t know what’s going to make my life fun and I’m hoping and praying that TikTok doesn’t get band please don’t get band TikTok I love you soooo muchhhhh!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-22T17:14:51-07:00

I’ve tried everything to fix this issue and it is still persistent. To list a few if the things I’ve done I’ve restarted the app, restarted my phone, cleared my cache (on multiple accounts as well to see it it would help, it didn’t), deleted the app and signed in again, and much more. I have at least 3 other tiktok accounts aside from this one (my main) and they all seem to work just fine. I truly don’t know what to do in this situation because all of my important things in on this account and I don’t just want to have to delete it and start all over again. I’d love to know how I can fix this problem. I can also like comments under the videos but not the videos themselves. Other than that the app is good and I have no other complaints than videos I’ve already seen before and liked before keep popping up on my fyp.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-11T15:41:17-07:00
8687504252,abahahajaja,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id902243509,24.4.0,4,great / ok,"ok so i WAS going to put a 5 star but these h updates that are coming out are upsetting me, like stories? nobody asked for that. when you record videos it’s completely different and i do not like it. the friends thing section is so useless i mean we have the following so what’s the point of that? yeah ok, it might show only new videos of people you are friends with on tiktok but following can literally do that. now of course, i understand you have to change the app in someway but like these are just not it (at least for me). there is also a preview effect thing that pops up out of nowhere when you’re recording, literally why? just let the person click on the effect themselves. tbh at this point when there’s an update i just don’t want to update the app because i’d rather the old (like before the march and so updates) version of tiktok rather than this.

alright, well that’s about it for the updates that i do not like, now this app is an addiction. at least for me, it’s always top 1st in my screen time and it’s been like that for let’s say maybe a year? this isn’t a complain i just think multiple people can relate.

but this app is awesome either way :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-19T12:05:39-07:00
8585982950,eag2010,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id818553988,24.0.0,4,It’s a good app for entertainment but it is a breeding ground for misinformation and controversy,"TikTok is a very good app for both advertising, entertainment, and etc but it can sometimes stir up controversy that sometimes go as far as death threats and cancel culture sure most of the targets deserve punishment but it shouldn’t go that far. For example a situation involving TikToker “OnlyJayus” (which I will not go in detail about) got her mass back lash and if I am correct even her IP address was leaked. Second thing misinformation is a pretty big problem on TikTok in my opinion sure you have large creators spreading researched facts and information but then you have thousands of smaller ones that spread things that are simply ludicrous and not true but it wouldn’t be a problem if most of or at least a good portion of TikTok actually believes it (mostly kids rarely teens). But to be frank there are simply many other problems on TikTok that I can’t simply cover but overall they’re not much of a problem but show their heads once and a while but overall it’s a good app I’d recommend it if you want to be entertained or start a career in entertainment just try not to get in to hot water or fall for misinformation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-19T19:31:50-07:00
8430064765,Arch384,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id491602628,23.4.0,3,Good App Just Some Major Issues,Tiktok is a great platform to grow and show your content to the world but there are a few things causing creators to stop using the platform that need to be fixed immediately. I am a creator with over 1.8M followers and I have been posting for over a year now. A issue is whenever I try to report a problem or ask any questions with my account I never get any responses from Tiktok or anyone. I believe it I’m a creator with that large of a following Tiktok should at-least reply to my questions. Another issue is the community guidelines and the Ai or bots used to suppress or shadow an your account and take down your videos. I have videos get taken down by TikTok’s robots and they should never have been taken down in the first place. Also Tiktok has been not allowing me and other users to pin comments. The pinned comments i pin are invisible to other accounts and the whole reason for a pinned comment is so other users can see them at the top of a comment section. I believe Tiktok has the potential to stay and be the best social media platform or any device. We as Tiktok creators just need some more support from the platform since it seems like Tiktok is trying to hurt creators for doing what they love.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-07T04:45:21-07:00
7404925057,Mandi1875,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id899849754,19.6.0,1,Unclear Account Suspension...,"My account was recently permanently banned. After going through the guidelines, nothing I posted violated community guidelines. Worse yet, the app is supposed to have an “appeal” option and it wouldn’t show up. Contacted customer support through the only way I could find in both the app and one the website, and I still have no clear explanation as to why my account was PERMANENTLY banned and no clear way to appeal their decision. I’m incredibly disappointed because I really enjoyed TikTok and made sure my videos fell within guidelines. I posted a “Happy Memorial Day” video with some planes flying over from an air show, and within hours my account was taken down. Previously I posted videos of my die cast car collection, and am completely unsure how any of those would land me in “permanently banned” mode.

Don’t put too much effort into your account if you have one...the app developers can clearly take away all your hard work in an instant for no clear reason. If there had been a reason for the ban, I wouldn’t be leaving this review, but since I didn’t violate any guidelines to my best knowledge (and I have reviewed the guidelines to make sure), and was given no explanation, I am making sure I share my story with friends and whoever will listen so they don’t have to feel the same way I did after all my work was gone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-29T23:09:34-07:00
7091126189,Best roblox user,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1151830871,18.7.0,4,Ok but.,I admit I’m addicted to tik tok.. but there is so much hate and negativity on this app it’s toxic.. Tik tok let’s groomers on this app rapers and all kinds of people.. You silence the people who’s trying to speak out and delete the videos of people spreading awareness of the causes. it’s sickening how tik tok can let people be so negative and disgusting on this app. But banned the people who stand up and speak. Tik tok is so toxic and nasty my 7 year old brother can go on there and find men jerking off on they pfp and girls twerking.. and a lot of other nasty stuff that shouldn’t be on there. .. My experience was people where attacking this one girl for being trans and I was politely explaining to them how that’s wrong.. and people went on my page and reported me.. but tik tok doesn’t look into the situation they just ban.. And I didn’t get a warning or anything my account was banned for nothing..  So if you are wanting you/your child to download this app I would be cautious of all the pornography/pedophiles on this app because tik tok lets them be on here.. how could u allow such a toxic environment?! And this app is 12+ so u allow 12+ to be attacked and harassed by grown men?! Maybe tik tok should look at they’re app and maybe look into situations instead of dismissing them !!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-11T07:21:24-07:00

This has me very frustrated bc it was a video of her in her swim suit top and shorts in and her cousin a toddler i a t shirt and her underwear i understand you hat u might think a toddler in her undies is not 
appropriate  but if you ask me it is not that horrible as all the other things that go on on this app for example throwing it back yes i might do it myself sometimes in a video with one of my friends but if that is ok to do then why is a video of a toddler in her undies getting taken down and teenage girls are wearing bikinis that show more that they should and that isn’t banned so all i’m trying to say is i know there are rules not wearing such appropriate attire is one of them but this is a toddler we’re talking about i think that’s it unnecessary that you have to take down a cute video of them playing around even tho they made another one just like that but that one didn’t get taken down so if you can stop that would be great oml tiktok 🙄",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-05T16:03:10-07:00
