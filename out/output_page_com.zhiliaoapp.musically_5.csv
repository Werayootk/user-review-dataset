I thought i would hate it and a bunch of worse things would have happen. After time i began to love it so much i have over 1k and i have a little issues but i‚Äôm fine with this not being fixed ‚Äúas soon as possibly‚Äù. So one of the problems are the for you page, once and blue moon you‚Äôll get on it, (unless your super lucky) and i would work so hard for it and never get on it, i came to think of it as in just not quality video enough for it and that‚Äôs alright! Another thing is i like to find random small accounts and like atleast 30 of their videos good or bad, but i can‚Äôt do it as often now we have a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù on likes and comments (which i think is really dumb). I have one last issue and that is that videos are being deleted for no reason!!! i had a really popular one of mine deleted and it made me super upset even tho it didn‚Äôt have anything wrong with it. Same for live streams innocent people get suspended because a 9 year old reported them. Thank you for taking the time to read this!

STOP I SAID.  Whatever.  Keep reading then. I could do this all day. Taping away on my phone, wasting time we both could be spending enjoying TikTok. Wait is it TicTok or TikTok? Did you look?  Are you sure you‚Äôre not reading some review of a knock off app? Nevermind, it‚Äôs TikTok. Pretty sure.

If you‚Äôre still reading this congrats.  Only 2.1% of readers make it this far. And believe me, there is much much more to come.  Up next...actually there isn‚Äôt. This has been fun, for both of us, but it‚Äôs getting ridiculous, right? I mean, what is the point of this? Why, oh Lord, why? Why won‚Äôt he stop? And by ‚Äòhe‚Äô I mean me. Ok, that‚Äôs it.

The review.  TikTok is good.  How‚Äôs that?  Believable?  It is true too.

I‚Äôve reported every one of these videos, yet I get a notice saying the guidelines had not been broken. what? I just looked down at my phone in complete disgust. I see so many videos about how tiktok doesn‚Äôt even take nudity down anymore, and I wholeheartedly agree. TikTok was a fun, safe app for kids and teens and now it‚Äôs like a porn site. It is insane that I‚Äôve reported at least 10 videos with clear adult porn in them, whether it‚Äôs a women‚Äôs chest or a man‚Äôs penis. It‚Äôs EXTREMELY wrong and gross for tiktok to take down a 15 year old girl swimming with her friends but not grown women flashing the camera.

You may think it‚Äôs an app for kids but... this app can get you in a LOT of trouble. The reason why I say that is because you have to think before you talk or do anything . If you DONT people will cancel you and send you death threats.  And you won‚Äôt even have any time to apologize. On TikTok there is a group of careless teenage boys called ‚ÄúThe Boys‚Äù and they cyber bully EVERYONE that is a poc/minority, lgbtq, or have a disability. If they see that you are one of them they will send you messages that are very harming. Not only that but this app can be very addicting you start to forget about your school work, friends, and even your family. You talk less with the people you love and know and person, because you‚Äôre always obsessed with your videos getting 100+ likes and trying to not get yourself shadow banned. Also I think TikTok should remove the videos for being our pfp because they are the main ones to not get taken down unless you have a lot of people reporting it. This app should not be for kids that are 12 or younger, because they be involved in cp or any other dangerous activities. I don‚Äôt think this is a good app, and I would be more than happy if this app were to be taken down.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-11T10:42:57-07:00

Many users have commented on this feature on how much they love it and appreciate TikTok adding this feature! However, more recent to this, TikTok has removed this feature for many users. Including me. When recording videos to post or even just for myself I like features and filters that make me look flattering. Story mode had a specific camera function and cropping that changed the way it looked when recording. Simply cropping it isn‚Äôt the same as already recording with it.

The system is either too harsh or not harsh enough, in just the past two days I've reported 7 different things that VERY MUCH violate the guidelines, and once it has been ""reviewed"" it was shown to have apparently not violated the guidelines. There is too much that the dev team lets the community get away with, and I understand that staff shouldn't be subjected to troubling and disturbing content but it reaches a certain point that there isn't any other choice than to have staff review reports. Not taking action against this issue is what enables people to continue violating your guidelines and until action is taken, people won't stop. To be able to make your platform a safe place, you need to hold your community accountable when it is actively hurting itself, and until you make it known that you're going to be taking action, people will continue abusing the lost reporting system.

My other problem is that you guys have a set up for notifications from what users we want to see. So i enable the notifications on a few of them but i never get notifications despite seeing their content later. I set up notifs on my gf so i can support her and gets others to support her to but anytime she uploads, i never get a notif.

Another thing is if I search up something, for example, once I searched up a pin/button maker because I was interested in buying one. The first 2 maybe 3 videos were about a pin/button maker, but the rest were completely random and literally had nothing to do with what I searched.

The problem is, TikTok shadowbans us. Our content is not shown to the world, causing our hard work and efforts to go down the drain. I have to constantly keep making new accounts so people can see my content. You shouldn‚Äôt shadowban people for using the same tags over again multiple times. It makes it clear what its from, what character, what the video‚Äôs about, etc. 
I‚Äôve had to take down videos and reupload because you shadowban my account and nothing is shown to anyone. Even after reuploading, it never seems to get anywhere either. 
I spend SO much money for this and you trash it like it‚Äôs nothing. Its cruel how you do this. As much as I may hate the app for this, I still remain on it because of how happy it can make me sometimes. It gets hard to enjoy it when all you do is shadowban and delete my content. It‚Äôs unfair and disgusting. 
At least let us KNOW before you go ahead and block all of our content. Like, give us cosplayers a warning, and then we‚Äôll start using different tags, or calming down on our posts a little. We aren‚Äôt spamming the hashtag or making inappropriate tiktoks, we‚Äôre making our cosplays known.

 i DO NOT recommend getting this app for anyone UNDER the age of 13-14 if you are considering getting this app for your child who is under that age PLEASE DO NOT. there are things on there that they should not be seeing/be exposed to that young. such as porn/nudity, constant negativity, politic wars, body checking, ED promotion, toxic beauty/body standards, SH, gore and much much more. not only that it tends to have an effect of making them grow up too quickly.

There should be an appeal process with TT admins and someone to speak to regarding these issues. Also, while some accounts are getting banned or having features temporarily turned off for no apparent reason, there are bully accounts growing a rapid rates. These accounts depict hate towards veterans, the disabled, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, etc. it breaks my heart every time I run into these accounts and see how they mistreat the helpless.

There are way too many people who get offended by little things. For example, I made a video simply following a trend of doing a certain dance aggressively. Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for ""being rude to the creator of the dance"" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was ""under review"" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They're just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don't receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers. Tik Tok also seems to tend to give my less successful videos way too many likes, which have a horrible like:view percentage. These views should instead go to the content that people like more.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-02T00:26:46-07:00

This app I love but all of my friends constantly have there app hacked and that is not right!!!üò°üò° so y‚Äôall definitely need to fix that. Maybe y‚Äôall could give some more effects to the app like where y‚Äôall could lessen more opportunities to do BAD things on it!!!!!!!!!! The songs are great! There are a few bad words here and there but I am just letting anyone reading this that does any sport. Do not where your uniform while trying to show off you behind or even without doing that to much can get you kicked of the team you are on and you don‚Äôt want to let your teammates down. But the dancing is my APPSOLUTE FAVORITE PART!!! So keep that just make this app KID FRIENDLY!!  Please because lots of the kids out there can‚Äôt even be on this app or get it. Because there parents are worried they are going to watch something they are not allowed to be looking at. And FIX the words in the music!!  Ok well I think I am done here please try to make some effects to this app please ok well BYE have a good day!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-07T17:58:06-07:00

If there is a way to change age cause I seem to not be able to change it to my real age. Can you add a gmail verification for age or another way to make it so you can‚Äôt just do one mistake then have to wait years till you can have the ability to do stuff. And another note in my opinion after realizing my mistake I looked over my account and saw the limit you guys put on these accounts and they are most unreasonable for the age I have put so as well with the verification problem can you guys put leisure for the older kids are like 12yo allow them to have some leisure but not too much and allow 15yo or 16yo‚Äôs to have people allowed to comment on their own videos cause that‚Äôs a bit much cause they‚Äôre already adults practically or be acting like it by now. I‚Äôm rating it a 3 due to some other problems but overall it‚Äôs a great app and I hope y‚Äôall actually take time to read this and not have a bot say ‚Äúgo here for help‚Äù like that‚Äôs not really what I want so overall again great app and a bit addictive,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-07T04:36:11-07:00

When I‚Äôm scared I just go on there an it makes my forget about it. And TikTok is the most fun app in the word it‚Äôs so cool with the cool effects and you get to stream your self and stuff. But there‚Äôs no other app were you can do that bc instagram you really only post pics of your self and that‚Äôs boring!! TikTok there‚Äôs funny vids and funny pranks and I most people love it so muchhh bc millions of people memories millions of dances. And TikTok is like has cool stuff bc when you go live people sent gift points to you. And even the names of the gift point are cool like,I am very rich,TikTok,rainbow puke,concert and other cool things. And when you go live and you don‚Äôt want to see the comments and stuff you can swipe to the left. And TikTok has there own emojiiiissss!!!! Even grandmas go on it bc it‚Äôs so fun and TikTok gives you special tip like how to skate bord how to fake cry how to do your nails and cool stuff like that and if TikTok gets band i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to make my life fun and I‚Äôm hoping and praying that TikTok doesn‚Äôt get band please don‚Äôt get band TikTok I love you soooo muchhhhh!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-22T17:14:51-07:00

I‚Äôve tried everything to fix this issue and it is still persistent. To list a few if the things I‚Äôve done I‚Äôve restarted the app, restarted my phone, cleared my cache (on multiple accounts as well to see it it would help, it didn‚Äôt), deleted the app and signed in again, and much more. I have at least 3 other tiktok accounts aside from this one (my main) and they all seem to work just fine. I truly don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation because all of my important things in on this account and I don‚Äôt just want to have to delete it and start all over again. I‚Äôd love to know how I can fix this problem. I can also like comments under the videos but not the videos themselves.

alright, well that‚Äôs about it for the updates that i do not like, now this app is an addiction. at least for me, it‚Äôs always top 1st in my screen time and it‚Äôs been like that for let‚Äôs say maybe a year? this isn‚Äôt a complain i just think multiple people can relate.

For example a situation involving TikToker ‚ÄúOnlyJayus‚Äù (which I will not go in detail about) got her mass back lash and if I am correct even her IP address was leaked. Second thing misinformation is a pretty big problem on TikTok in my opinion sure you have large creators spreading researched facts and information but then you have thousands of smaller ones that spread things that are simply ludicrous and not true but it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if most of or at least a good portion of TikTok actually believes it (mostly kids rarely teens). But to be frank there are simply many other problems on TikTok that I can‚Äôt simply cover but overall they‚Äôre not much of a problem but show their heads once and a while but overall it‚Äôs a good app I‚Äôd recommend it if you want to be entertained or start a career in entertainment just try not to get in to hot water or fall for misinformation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-19T19:31:50-07:00
8430064765,Arch384,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id491602628,23.4.0,3,Good App Just Some Major Issues,Tiktok is a great platform to grow and show your content to the world but there are a few things causing creators to stop using the platform that need to be fixed immediately. I am a creator with over 1.8M followers and I have been posting for over a year now. A issue is whenever I try to report a problem or ask any questions with my account I never get any responses from Tiktok or anyone. I believe it I‚Äôm a creator with that large of a following Tiktok should at-least reply to my questions. Another issue is the community guidelines and the Ai or bots used to suppress or shadow an your account and take down your videos. I have videos get taken down by TikTok‚Äôs robots and they should never have been taken down in the first place. Also Tiktok has been not allowing me and other users to pin comments. The pinned comments i pin are invisible to other accounts and the whole reason for a pinned comment is so other users can see them at the top of a comment section. I believe Tiktok has the potential to stay and be the best social media platform or any device. We as Tiktok creators just need some more support from the platform since it seems like Tiktok is trying to hurt creators for doing what they love.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-07T04:45:21-07:00

After going through the guidelines, nothing I posted violated community guidelines. Worse yet, the app is supposed to have an ‚Äúappeal‚Äù option and it wouldn‚Äôt show up. Contacted customer support through the only way I could find in both the app and one the website, and I still have no clear explanation as to why my account was PERMANENTLY banned and no clear way to appeal their decision. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed because I really enjoyed TikTok and made sure my videos fell within guidelines. I posted a ‚ÄúHappy Memorial Day‚Äù video with some planes flying over from an air show, and within hours my account was taken down. Previously I posted videos of my die cast car collection, and am completely unsure how any of those would land me in ‚Äúpermanently banned‚Äù mode.

Don‚Äôt put too much effort into your account if you have one...the app developers can clearly take away all your hard work in an instant for no clear reason. If there had been a reason for the ban, I wouldn‚Äôt be leaving this review, but since I didn‚Äôt violate any guidelines to my best knowledge (and I have reviewed the guidelines to make sure), and was given no explanation, I am making sure I share my story with friends and whoever will listen so they don‚Äôt have to feel the same way I did after all my work was gone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-29T23:09:34-07:00

Tik tok let‚Äôs groomers on this app rapers and all kinds of people.. You silence the people who‚Äôs trying to speak out and delete the videos of people spreading awareness of the causes. it‚Äôs sickening how tik tok can let people be so negative and disgusting on this app. But banned the people who stand up and speak. Tik tok is so toxic and nasty my 7 year old brother can go on there and find men jerking off on they pfp and girls twerking.. and a lot of other nasty stuff that shouldn‚Äôt be on there. .. My experience was people where attacking this one girl for being trans and I was politely explaining to them how that‚Äôs wrong.. and people went on my page and reported me.. but tik tok doesn‚Äôt look into the situation they just ban.. And I didn‚Äôt get a warning or anything my account was banned for nothing..  So if you are wanting you/your child to download this app I would be cautious of all the pornography/pedophiles on this app because tik tok lets them be on here.. how could u allow such a toxic environment?! And this app is 12+ so u allow 12+ to be attacked and harassed by grown men?! Maybe tik tok should look at they‚Äôre app and maybe look into situations instead of dismissing them !!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-11T07:21:24-07:00
