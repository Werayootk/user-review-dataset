Sometimes it can be a little hit or miss and I wish they would allow you to leave some kind of review messages for people or even just to the company. So far I’ve used it four times and three of four times I’ve been more than happy with what I got. The only time I wasn’t super impressed was when I went to a doughnut shop that had just started using this app and they gave me like three doughnuts (I paid $5) but I went to another even nicer doughnut place and got 8 doughnuts which would have been like $18 for $4.

The app is simple to use, there are no annoying ads.  If there are I haven’t noticed them. I wouldn’t mind a few ads i FB it supports the app, though).

 I think the service of making sure food doesn’t go to waste should be a requirement. The food is discounted and that’s great incentive to pick up something. Being in the store generally just makes just want to return as well.

However, the notification system doesn’t work like you’d expect: sending you a notice when your favorited/starred places post their goods. To be able to score a bag from the popular spots, you have to use a third party notification app/service and that’s just sad. I tried setting alarms for the times my store would post but it’s so random, it’s just a frustration and disappointment. 

I gave this 2 stars because while it’s a cool idea, you can’t really use it without the 3rd party service.

I am a graduate nursing student, so getting discounted pastries and meals is amazing - and I also feel good about it not going into the trash.

One suggestion to continue to improve the app would be to add an add-on option. Many of the speciality coffee shops offer pastries and I would love to add a coffee if that’s an option potentially moving forward. I had one ask me when I arrived, but I was behind schedule and didn’t have time to wait.

I have enjoyed trying it out but probably won’t use it often because it was challenging with my food allergies. 

I have tried the app at a few businesses in my area. At one the staff asked me about allergies and nicely packed a bag based on my input. Another gave me a prepacked bag. And at one place they packed a bag when I got there but seemed very frustrated when I mentioned dietary restrictions (though I can eat almost everything they sell). 

I think the app could better accommodate customers with dietary restrictions with a few enhancements:
- Encourage businesses to include a bit more of a description of the type of items they provide. I understand that it will vary, but even a general description or an example of typical items would be helpful. 
- Add a flag to identify businesses that are willing to try to accommodate dietary restrictions.
- Allow users to share comments about their experiences with participating businesses, such as what kind of food they got.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-03T20:28:34-07:00

My issue comes with the “ingredients and allergens” section. What is the point of having that if it’s A) going to say the same thing for each store/restaurant? and B) not give any details for what could potentially be an allergen in the bag?

The way this section should be utilized is the store/restaurant should send in a list of ingredients that they use and the app should list what is commonly found in the bags (ex. “Bag may have soy based foods, egg based foods, meats, dairy products” etc. 

It’s very annoying and seems useless. It also then takes more time on the users end to do further research on the food that can be offered in the bags. If this was vetted a bit more, there would be more transparency and more people may be inclined to save bags. 

It doesn’t ruin the mystery if the stores tell the company what would potentially be in the bags that week or set up the allergens that day for the app, it would be really helpful for those that want to support those businesses and save the waste.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-14T05:52:06-07:00

I used it for the first time today to pick up something extra from the local grocery store. The process was quick and efficient. I’m glad the waste is going to good use too!

The one thing is, I would LOVE it if I could narrow down by gluten-free options or specify to vendors not to give me... like not get 2 loaves of bread and fried chicken tenders. Which is what I got today from the grocery store’s bag. I purposely chose groceries since I thought it was more statistically likely to get old produce than stale baked goods. I’m lucky my roommates can eat it at least, but it was a HUGE bummer to open it up and realize I couldn’t eat anything.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-10T15:22:06-07:00

Now I wish someone would spread the word to other food places in Los Angeles because it is not only a disgrace and shame that most places have to throw their food out and dosed with bleach so homeless do not take from trash. So glad someone designed this app!

So good luck guessing when to try and catch these deals. The little heart icon for tagging Favorites has been pretty unhelpful. You’d think that if it was marked Favorites, notifications would pop up when that establishment has something for sale. That doesn’t happen.

Allow people to sort by distance! Two miles in NYC is a massive radius that makes no sense for people actually looking to get to know places in their neighborhoods. No sense in setting a location if I can’t go anywhere in the radius without spending more money to get there than it would take for me to buy other food.

Allow for a more robust review system so people can see fellow customers’ reviews of individual establishments. If we’re all in this together, let’s be transparent about it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-24T04:59:11-07:00

Also, I’m so tired of seeing 7-11 on my home screen every time I load the app. I don’t want food from there, not now, not ever in my life. Let me customize the home screen with what I actually want to see and stop wasting my time scrolling to the bottom or clicking the favorites button.
