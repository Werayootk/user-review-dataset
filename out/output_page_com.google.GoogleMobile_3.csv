Other Constant Problems:
News Feed: Absolutely horrible and biased. I set it to not show me news about sports or trump...spams me with both. Spams meaningless news about the Kardashian’s and other useless people...I check off ”Don’t show me Stories of/from (TOPIC/SUBJECT)” I refresh the app...here’s more of what I told it not to show.

Topics I Would Enjoy: It shows 6 articles in a row of the same subject/title from different sources. 

Extremely Old News: It shows news articles as highlights or something I may be interested in...from 3 years ago. And it won’t remove the article for weeks or months. I had an article about Slipknot that was two years old that remained on news feed for about three months and would not go away no matter what I did.

Now it seems the news feed is a joke now. When I update the feed, scroll the stories and then reach the end to tap more stories. Most, if not all the original stories are on the second page as well. So if they show up on front page I don’t want or need them on the more stories page. Also if I read a story I don’t necessarily need it to continually show up in the feed any more.
