Really the kindest hosts who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I was truly impressed and touched by their kindness!

The only reason I‚Äôm rating right now is because I think their taxi service practices is a bit shady. 

Long story short I booked a taxi using bookings 6 months ago and it was confirmed but couple of days before flying I could not get to the taxi website to make sure everything was accounted for.

Talking with customer service they told me that apparently I got declined due to not having enough taxis in the place I wanted to go. However I did not receive a cancellation email and in my bookings app/emails it still listed as confirmed. He said that I can get a refund if I decide not to use it. Which then begs the question‚Ä¶ why did I still get charged when the service cancelled on me? Not only that, I didn‚Äôt even know I was declined until my conversation with customer service. I decided to get refunded for the taxi just cos I didn‚Äôt want the headache of trying this again.

There were local food everywhere and multiple restaurants within less the 5 min walking distance. Miss Clara (house keeper) was  absolutely amazing. She was willing to answer any questions we had and was one of the friendliest ladies we have ever met.
