Tik Tok will wait until the problem is way to far out of control to actually do anything about it. The only good things you may see on this app are some of the content creators, and I can‚Äôt even guarantee that they won‚Äôt be a pedo, or racist, or homophobic.

While this comes in handy getting some of the bad people off the app, it won‚Äôt get rid of anyone verified, no matter how big of an issue it is, and will keep bad people who already had a platform on a pedestal. This is also an issue because people will mass report innocent people who had nothing to do with it. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the gender and age wars that people seem to need on there.

I‚Äôm not sure if this actually is a bug but it‚Äôs still something that needs to be worked on, the algorithm. The TikTok algorithm is very weird and glitchy... I‚Äôm not sure if it was meant to be like this but it seems that only people who are straight, white, skinny, and do weird ‚Äútrendy‚Äù dances can get on the fyp (for you page). It is also very hard to gain followers because of this. The algorithm tends to really ignore creators that fall into the LGBTQ category, liberal category, cosplay category, anime category, or if you are just a poc who speaks out about the injustices in the world. TikTok algorithm will do something that is called shadow banning to creators if they aren‚Äôt ‚Äútrendy‚Äù and since it is very difficult to get on the fyp this happens to a lot of people. There are also things to talk about such as the actual bugs like when TikTok will randomly break for no reason, when you lose followers that didn‚Äôt actually unfollow you, and when you don‚Äôt get notifications when you should be. These are just a few things that have happened so far and I STRONGLY urge TikTok to try and fix these problems before they lose a whole bunch of people.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-03T13:39:35-07:00

6168129707,Carly Costa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17801685,16.6.2,5,Tik Tok is very fun but...,"Tik Tok is probably my most used app. Mostly because there is lots of comedy and dances you can learn. But one thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the fact that they don‚Äôt always take down inappropriate videos, but they do take down wholesome videos for no reason. Like on one Tik Toker, she made a video titled ‚ÄúBible Stories With Liv‚Äù. And guess what? It got taken down. When it was literally BIBLW STORIES. Yes I watched it before it got taken down, and it was very funny and about the bible story. But then I will see videos of girls/boys talking about or showing inappropriate things in their videos, and they might get reported dozens of times, but Tik Tok will not take it down. Another example, a girl posted a video of black lives matter, and, you guessed it. That got taken down, too! I just think that they could try harder. But some pros about the app is you can be very creative and inspiring. You can share your talents without having to be afraid. You can sing, act, dance, draw, paint, and so much more. It is so fun and I definitely recommend it. But if Tik Tok is reading this, please take my word about the taken down videos into consideration.

It is such a good app and I love how everyone can share ideas. One question though; why can't people without a lot of followers get discovered as much? They might take like, 2 hours making a video and doing their best quality and posting it with tags and all that, yet they still only may get 5 likes and it would take a long time to get more followers and be discovered. Lots of people who are popular on tiktok have it easy because they post a new video and so many people follow them that it instantly goes viral and all those other good videos made by people who haven't had a lot of followers yet get drowned out. That annoys me, but I won't complain too much. It could take years to get popular or could take months. Overall, this is a great app and I love it!

Just make it where people that provide you a driver‚Äôs license or a state ID or some kind of legal document that they are who they say they are get them verified because it should not be a competition to prove that you are a real person or matter about the amount of followers you have to prove who you are.

My older sisters can scroll on TikTok for hours, and is very unhealthy for her eyes. My best friend, me and my twin sister all made a promise that we would never get TikTok but soon enough I got it I only got it for the memes, but I told somebody in that person told my best friend and that‚Äôs when she got it and it took over her life. It‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre invisible around her because she‚Äôs so addicted to popularity and followers. Every time I go over to my best friend‚Äôs house she‚Äôs always on it and it‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs ignoring us that she always wants to do TikTok with her. This is why I am writing a one star review to TikTok. Number one it is taking over my family‚Äôs life and friends. Number two he can keep you in your room or in your own little bubble for hours, and hours scrolling on a screen. Number three. If people were to go on TikTok, I‚Äôll think that TikTok should put reminders on their screens to take a break or a timer until you get to go back on TikTok.

There is of course some miscommunication between what the users of the app want to see improved.

6014646084,¬•¬•Atlas¬•¬•,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id471932464,16.2.0,1,TikTok is sketchy..and not in a good way,"Recently I have downloaded the app TikTok and found it somewhat entertaining. At first I thought the app was just some annoying remake of musiclay so I didn‚Äôt want to waste time and space in my phone download it. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are some funny videos or cool videos on there that are entertaining but... I‚Äôve noticed some have been deleted along with hashtags. 

  TikTok has repeatedly deleted countless videos showing African Americans and others showing pride of there culture, religion, and sexuality along with deleting #BLM #blacklivesmatter and #LGBTQ.  I understand creators might have a opinion on African Americans. But showcasing it on a huge ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù app with children who partake in videos is odd and highly inappropriate. As a creator wouldn‚Äôt it make since to make the app fit for everyone to post whatever they would like (as long as it fits the guide lines) and share there interests and ideas without have a reason to have there creation deleted? I just want this app to be far because so far, it has not been. I hope this app gets its self together because honestly nobody wants to have a racist owned app on there phone.

And also don‚Äôt waste your time downloading this app anyway. It‚Äôs literally full of a bunch of weird children trying to be grown. Thanks for reading ~ cidnee capers",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-30T11:41:28-07:00

Comments are placed in random places and it‚Äôs so hard to go through new comments when they are across the entire commenting section. This needs to be fixed cause this is bugging me and other people so much. 2, where did the promote option go? If I want to promote a comment so more people will see it, I should be able to. That is something that I really don‚Äôt understand why it would have been taken away. And finally, 3, when I am looking at my own videos, (this is just an example number), it will say that I have 10 comments but when I click on it, there are none. And I know that there are comments because when I am looking on the notification page I can see them. And when I click on them I am able to look at each individual comment.

I was getting a lot of followers, then my daughter got injured and I had to take a step back social media for a while. I now am coming back! In the beginning I really did not know what to post, but I found what made me happy. I want to continue doing that. However I‚Äôm still not understanding the algorithm. I feel like only those who are gorgeous rich can show off their amazingly wealthy extravagant lives get more views and are who are TikTok famous. I‚Äôm just a 42 year old single mother and I just wish my videos were pushed out there more, I don‚Äôt think I am near as good as others on this app but I do feel like I could get a good amount if I was to have the exposure.

The second issue is the following limit and following accounts in general. There is no filter like on instagram or anything where you can find the least integrated with or the oldest followed accounts. again, YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY REMOVE ANY ACCOUNTS YOU NO LONGER WANT TO FOLLOW.

Please for the love of god take the initiative and just create filters for the following lists, and make the favorites listings like for videos, sounds, etc easier to deal with.

There is SO MUCH representation for the lgbtq community, people with disabilities and people who are just simply different.

However, if you don‚Äôt push out videos regularly your content is not going to be put out for anyone to see and that can be bad for content creators. Not only that but TikTok‚Äôs new update will suppress even more creators because you can buy viewers and buy followers. The only reason someone would need this feature is if they suddenly start getting suppressed, so what will TikTok do? Start hiding other people‚Äôs content. Then they have a reason to use the feature. So the only people you will see on TikTok are those who payed for you to see them. Of course there will be the rare few who don‚Äôt but they won‚Äôt have much followers or views. Not only that but TikTok is really bad at deciding what content needs a censorship. I‚Äôve seen videos where there was blood, violence, hate, etc. While they were censoring videos that had bright lights, even though they already had warned their viewers.

My account has recently been blocked from posting for a week because I broke community guidelines, which is fine and I understand that, however - when I got it back after a week, I posted three videos in one day, none of which were a threat to the community guidelines whatsoever, and that same day I got blocked again! I have tried reaching out to them through the apps ‚Äúreport and issue ‚Äú section, email, and even Instagram! They have never gotten back to me and my account remains blocked. I take my account seriously as well as I have a good amount of followings. Tiktok, please resolve this issue of removing videos that aren‚Äôt inappropriate or blocking accounts that are innocent.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-02T07:51:30-07:00

Now, of all times, we need TikTok. My country faces civil unrest that won‚Äôt be solved without meaningful discourse. The way TikTok encourages people to have discussions about nuanced subjects on everything from personal growth to national politics with their own voices is revolutionary to our way of understanding ourselves and each other. Sure it comes with the pitfalls of social media - but I didn‚Äôt see Congress give half this energy to Facebook post-Cambridge Analytica. TikTok has personally changed my life, connected me with community like I‚Äôve never had before, and given me more focused purpose, and incidentally taken my business to the next level.   I‚Äôve had discussions and reached understandings with people of opposing political views like I never thought possible.

One reason being, is that when anyone reports a video, even for no reason at all where it is not breaking community guidelines, the app does not allow it to be visible on your profile and is ‚Äúunder review‚Äù. One of mine was supposedly reported even though it did not break any community guidelines (and I read the full rules in fine print for the app) and it has been hidden from my profile to everyone for months. This happens on lives as well, if someone reports it the app automatically makes the live stop, even if it did not break any community guidelines. If someone wants to report a video, the video should be visible until deemed otherwise if it is in fact breaking any rules, then it should be deleted. Many users work hard for their content and they shouldn‚Äôt be punished for the small percentage of people who report any random content for whatever pleasure it brings them if it doesn‚Äôt break any guidelines. The app should also notify the user if their video was reported and is under review with factual evidence on why it is under review so the user can learn from it for next time, or if it is a mistake, can be resolved. And that is why I am rating it 1 star as of this time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-06T17:39:34-07:00

There was not any video I posted that ever violated the community guidelines yet my account is gone for the second time and I‚Äôll have to appeal it again. Other creators have had the same issue, they‚Äôll sign into the app and see their account is removed and they don‚Äôt know why. TikTok is great in terms of finding the videos you want to see.

It‚Äôs funny how they ban any accounts that people report without actually looking into it. My account was centered around being part of the lgbtq+ community. So of course, there‚Äôs going to people who report my account because they don‚Äôt agree with my content. Yet they‚Äôll keep up accounts that go against their ‚Äúhate speech guidelines.‚Äù They had to even make it so that creators couldn‚Äôt message underage children and the same underage kids can‚Äôt receive comments.

This seems good at first that you don‚Äôt have to click the following or fyp buttons to get there, however if you have had the app for a while you know that it used to be whatever page you‚Äôre or (fyp or following) you used to just swipe right to see the persons account and other videos. Which leads to the inconvenience, if you accidentally swipe right you lose the video you are trying to watch and most likely will not be able to find it again. If you do it on purpose and you were trying to look at their page to see if you wanted to give them a follow, then you have to go back to your personal page and go back to your last liked video. Unless you didn‚Äôt like it then you will have an extremely difficult time finding again.

Accounts are now using captions to warn people that it‚Äôs fake so they don‚Äôt get reported. I don‚Äôt feel that should be necessary. And going live should be an option to everyone. It‚Äôs not fair when you have to have 1,000 followers because even people without 1,000 could still have fans that want them to go live. And what‚Äôs with the whole Verification thing? I don‚Äôt get why we need that. There shouldn‚Äôt be a status rank on the app. This app is for people older than 12 and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that the people who bend that rule have any right to report things because they are too young for that. The producer of the game should make an app similar to TikTok where it‚Äôs safe for younger kids to be on. Only kid friendly sounds and such. This way no one on TikTok will be reported for no reason. It could be called TikTok Junior or something. It could have all the same features but only kid friendly sounds and content. Sorry if you don‚Äôt agree, but those who are younger and are reporting for no reason are ruining others enjoyment. One of my videos was reported and I don‚Äôt cuss, or have any gore on my page.
