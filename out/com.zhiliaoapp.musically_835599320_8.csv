It has shown me that what ever I’m going through will soon get better. It’s made me more confident in my body. This app is the reason why I laugh everyday. This app makes me laugh, and smile. I don’t know what I’m going to do if it gets banned. This app has taught me to never be ashamed of your past. It has shown me that it’s ok to cry, that it’s ok to breakdown because it will eventually get better. It has taught me to always smile and to always be happy. This app has shown me that people are going through what I went through and that I’m not alone in the world. It’s the reason why I’m still here. This app has saved so many life's. It has stopped so many people from harming them selves. This app has made people love themselves for who they are. This app has made people love their body’s.

Tik Tok will wait until the problem is way to far out of control to actually do anything about it. The only good things you may see on this app are some of the content creators, and I can’t even guarantee that they won’t be a pedo, or racist, or homophobic. (Speaking from experience, and this has happened more than once). Another issue is people could mass report your account for anything. While this comes in handy getting some of the bad people off the app, it won’t get rid of anyone verified, no matter how big of an issue it is, and will keep bad people who already had a platform on a pedestal. This is also an issue because people will mass report innocent people who had nothing to do with it. Don’t even get me started on the gender and age wars that people seem to need on there. It is absolutely not worth it, no matter how fun somebody makes. It will get depressing really fast. Don’t waste you time or sanity on this.

I’m not sure if this actually is a bug but it’s still something that needs to be worked on, the algorithm. The TikTok algorithm is very weird and glitchy... I’m not sure if it was meant to be like this but it seems that only people who are straight, white, skinny, and do weird “trendy” dances can get on the fyp (for you page). It is also very hard to gain followers because of this. The algorithm tends to really ignore creators that fall into the LGBTQ category, liberal category, cosplay category, anime category, or if you are just a poc who speaks out about the injustices in the world. TikTok algorithm will do something that is called shadow banning to creators if they aren’t “trendy” and since it is very difficult to get on the fyp this happens to a lot of people. There are also things to talk about such as the actual bugs like when TikTok will randomly break for no reason, when you lose followers that didn’t actually unfollow you, and when you don’t get notifications when you should be. These are just a few things that have happened so far and I STRONGLY urge TikTok to try and fix these problems before they lose a whole bunch of people.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-03T13:39:35-07:00

I don’t understand why this is happening in one single app tiktok has gotten big for the past year it’s been two years now tiktok is getting shut down.

6168129707,Carly Costa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id17801685,16.6.2,5,Tik Tok is very fun but...,"Tik Tok is probably my most used app. Mostly because there is lots of comedy and dances you can learn. But one thing I don’t like about it is the fact that they don’t always take down inappropriate videos, but they do take down wholesome videos for no reason. Like on one Tik Toker, she made a video titled “Bible Stories With Liv”. And guess what? It got taken down. When it was literally BIBLW STORIES. Yes I watched it before it got taken down, and it was very funny and about the bible story. But then I will see videos of girls/boys talking about or showing inappropriate things in their videos, and they might get reported dozens of times, but Tik Tok will not take it down. Another example, a girl posted a video of black lives matter, and, you guessed it. That got taken down, too! I just think that they could try harder. But some pros about the app is you can be very creative and inspiring. You can share your talents without having to be afraid. You can sing, act, dance, draw, paint, and so much more. It is so fun and I definitely recommend it. But if Tik Tok is reading this, please take my word about the taken down videos into consideration.  Thanks!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-07T05:59:02-07:00

It took me literally 2 minutes to sign up and get my profile ready. It showed me how to scroll and like and all these other things to get me started! It is such a good app and I love how everyone can share ideas. One question though; why can't people without a lot of followers get discovered as much? They might take like, 2 hours making a video and doing their best quality and posting it with tags and all that, yet they still only may get 5 likes and it would take a long time to get more followers and be discovered. Lots of people who are popular on tiktok have it easy because they post a new video and so many people follow them that it instantly goes viral and all those other good videos made by people who haven't had a lot of followers yet get drowned out. That annoys me, but I won't complain too much. It could take years to get popular or could take months. Overall, this is a great app and I love it!

Also, the whole “your typing to fast” needs to go jump off a cliff. And the hate is incredible.i know that there is not much that you guys can do about the hate, but it is becoming a huge problem. People are killing them selfs over an app that is supposed to be fill with positive energy. When we report the comments, they never get taken down, unlike some harmless vids. Please just include the feature that when reports a comment, take the time to read it of just delete it. Another thing is the predators. Like all social media platforms, it has scary people.

The bullying is an issue but overall it’s a great app and I really enjoy making videos of me and my dog. It really brought me out of my depression and gave me something other than my depression to focus on. Just make it where people that provide you a driver’s license or a state ID or some kind of legal document that they are who they say they are get them verified because it should not be a competition to prove that you are a real person or matter about the amount of followers you have to prove who you are.

My older sisters can scroll on TikTok for hours, and is very unhealthy for her eyes. My best friend, me and my twin sister all made a promise that we would never get TikTok but soon enough I got it I only got it for the memes, but I told somebody in that person told my best friend and that’s when she got it and it took over her life. It’s almost like we’re invisible around her because she’s so addicted to popularity and followers. Every time I go over to my best friend’s house she’s always on it and it’s almost like she’s ignoring us that she always wants to do TikTok with her. This is why I am writing a one star review to TikTok. Number one it is taking over my family’s life and friends. Number two he can keep you in your room or in your own little bubble for hours, and hours scrolling on a screen. Number three. If people were to go on TikTok, I’ll think that TikTok should put reminders on their screens to take a break or a timer until you get to go back on TikTok. So yes, these are all my reasons why I think that TikTok is a bad app to have on your phone or any device.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-21T18:57:58-07:00

I however enjoy the news, pet videos, cartoon snippets, recipes, and investigative journalism all of which are found on tiktok. It’s perfect for someone with adhd who can get bored with long videos and it almost feels like channel surfing sometimes. I’m sad to see it might go as I have learned a lot of things and continue to. Some people teach you languages, some law advice, and some with cleaning. Anything your heart desires you can find that niche on tiktok. I hope it’s not banned.

Just like all social media, you will get hate. However TikTok’s 
Community guidelines will prevent that from happening. I do have some small complaints though. TikTok’s guidelines mess up sometimes. I can suffer consequences such as getting post blocked, getting blocked from updating my profile, or even getting your account permanently banned from the app. These consequences happen even if you did not violate any of the guidelines. TikTok will say that it was a mistake but that does not make up for what it’s blocked me from doing. Another problem is the age you have to be to have TikTok. I believe that it’s up to the parents to decide how old you have to be to have TikTok. I do think that there should be a line somewhere but 13 years old just doesn’t seem right!

There is of course some miscommunication between what the users of the app want to see improved. Let’s look at for example algorithms that support independent artists, educators, and content creators. A way tiktok could go about this this is looking into customizable fyp or fyp’s that are swipable to from the current fyp/follower video streaming interface

For example, the user has the option to swipe to the left or right further on the current following/fyp main screen— this will take them to new, customizable fyp or fyp’s that can be chosen to only show educational videos, only show tiktok marketplace videos, only dancing tutorials, or maybe even to let the user experience things that are in contrast to their normal fyp/follower algorithms",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-20T10:44:24-07:00

The private accounts are good but it make them better, you can only pick people you want to look at your TikTok page/account. For example, if you don’t pick someone and they go on your account it will say “This Account Did Not Let You Look At This Page” Or another message.

Now don’t get me wrong, there are some funny videos or cool videos on there that are entertaining but... I’ve noticed some have been deleted along with hashtags. 

  TikTok has repeatedly deleted countless videos showing African Americans and others showing pride of there culture, religion, and sexuality along with deleting #BLM #blacklivesmatter and #LGBTQ.  I understand creators might have a opinion on African Americans. But showcasing it on a huge “successful” app with children who partake in videos is odd and highly inappropriate. As a creator wouldn’t it make since to make the app fit for everyone to post whatever they would like (as long as it fits the guide lines) and share there interests and ideas without have a reason to have there creation deleted? I just want this app to be far because so far, it has not been. I hope this app gets its self together because honestly nobody wants to have a racist owned app on there phone.

And also don’t waste your time downloading this app anyway. It’s literally full of a bunch of weird children trying to be grown. Thanks for reading ~ cidnee capers",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-30T11:41:28-07:00

But there’s a few problems that have just recently appeared since the last couple updates. 1, why are the comments all over the place??? They aren’t in order. Comments are placed in random places and it’s so hard to go through new comments when they are across the entire commenting section. This needs to be fixed cause this is bugging me and other people so much. 2, where did the promote option go? If I want to promote a comment so more people will see it, I should be able to. That is something that I really don’t understand why it would have been taken away. And finally, 3, when I am looking at my own videos, (this is just an example number), it will say that I have 10 comments but when I click on it, there are none. And I know that there are comments because when I am looking on the notification page I can see them. And when I click on them I am able to look at each individual comment.

My daughter did tell me about it but said I was too old. So it approval wrong I made an account. I was getting a lot of followers, then my daughter got injured and I had to take a step back social media for a while. I now am coming back! In the beginning I really did not know what to post, but I found what made me happy. I want to continue doing that. However I’m still not understanding the algorithm. I feel like only those who are gorgeous rich can show off their amazingly wealthy extravagant lives get more views and are who are TikTok famous. I’m just a 42 year old single mother and I just wish my videos were pushed out there more, I don’t think I am near as good as others on this app but I do feel like I could get a good amount if I was to have the exposure. So if you could try to push forward in the algorithm and put those like myself out there. Put it out there first please. I would greatly appreciate it.

This past week I was told my account is going to be banned soon if I get another strike and the reason I got a strike was because I commented “🤡” twice and they got take down both times. I appealed and it didn’t get fixed. Not sure where in their guidelines it says you can’t use emojis. Then my comment got taken down for saying “my gynecologist is a gay man”. Oh I’m sorry I didn’t know that saying “gay” is now inappropriate, but yet I see people using literal homophobic slurs and hate crime agenda but yet that stays up. Then I also commented “the last thing I’d want to be is a male” and it got taken down. Again, oh I’m sorry I didn’t know you can’t openly express opinions? But the amount of sexist garbage I encounter daily on this garbage app is insane. My account is literally one removed comment away from being banned and it’s not even my fault.

The second issue is the following limit and following accounts in general. There is no filter like on instagram or anything where you can find the least integrated with or the oldest followed accounts. again, YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY REMOVE ANY ACCOUNTS YOU NO LONGER WANT TO FOLLOW. Even deleted or removed accounts are still stuck there! it’s so annoying! 

Please for the love of god take the initiative and just create filters for the following lists, and make the favorites listings like for videos, sounds, etc easier to deal with. I don’t want to take an hour or two out of my day to just clear everything out when the tiktok developer team could fix it and make everyone’s lives easier.

But instead of talking about all the bad, (which you could simply take away by holding down and pressing “not interested” on every video you come across till you get the for you page you want) let’s talk about the good:
There is SO MUCH representation for the lgbtq community, people with disabilities and people who are just simply different. Most singers fame comes from TikTok, which shows how much it could have a good or bad impact on a person. And there’s so much representation for poc it’s amazing. But really, this app is a 50/50.

Watching a few of these videos make time pass by quickly. However, if you don’t push out videos regularly your content is not going to be put out for anyone to see and that can be bad for content creators. Not only that but TikTok’s new update will suppress even more creators because you can buy viewers and buy followers. The only reason someone would need this feature is if they suddenly start getting suppressed, so what will TikTok do? Start hiding other people’s content. Then they have a reason to use the feature. So the only people you will see on TikTok are those who payed for you to see them. Of course there will be the rare few who don’t but they won’t have much followers or views. Not only that but TikTok is really bad at deciding what content needs a censorship. I’ve seen videos where there was blood, violence, hate, etc. While they were censoring videos that had bright lights, even though they already had warned their viewers. TikTok only cares about the money it’s making, and currently it’s self destructing without realizing it.

One of mine was supposedly reported even though it did not break any community guidelines (and I read the full rules in fine print for the app) and it has been hidden from my profile to everyone for months. This happens on lives as well, if someone reports it the app automatically makes the live stop, even if it did not break any community guidelines. If someone wants to report a video, the video should be visible until deemed otherwise if it is in fact breaking any rules, then it should be deleted. Many users work hard for their content and they shouldn’t be punished for the small percentage of people who report any random content for whatever pleasure it brings them if it doesn’t break any guidelines. The app should also notify the user if their video was reported and is under review with factual evidence on why it is under review so the user can learn from it for next time, or if it is a mistake, can be resolved. And that is why I am rating it 1 star as of this time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-06T17:39:34-07:00

I would give TikTok 5 stars if I wouldn’t have had as many issues with my account. I have had my account taken down without any videos violating the community guidelines. Just like that, no warning, just my account with thousands of followers gone. I appealed this decision and got it back about a week later. I read over the entire community guidelines and made absolutely sure none of my videos violated them. Recently, I’ve had my account taken down for the second time without any reason why whatsoever. There was not any video I posted that ever violated the community guidelines yet my account is gone for the second time and I’ll have to appeal it again. Other creators have had the same issue, they’ll sign into the app and see their account is removed and they don’t know why. TikTok is great in terms of finding the videos you want to see. But I’m terms of creating videos I don’t know if I recommend it given that I’ve put a lot of effort into my own videos just to have my whole account vanish for no reason…twice.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-17T12:13:21-07:00

I opened up my app one day and I had a white message on my screen saying that I was permanently banned for “multiple guideline violations.” I was never made aware that I violated any guidelines whatsoever. I submitted an appeal to being banned and still haven’t received anything back on whether my appeal was approved or denied. I sent 2 separate emails and still nothing. This isn’t the first time I’ve tried to contact their support. I’ve tried 10 times on my original account in the “report a problem” section and I never got any help. It’s funny how they ban any accounts that people report without actually looking into it. My account was centered around being part of the lgbtq+ community. So of course, there’s going to people who report my account because they don’t agree with my content. Yet they’ll keep up accounts that go against their “hate speech guidelines.” They had to even make it so that creators couldn’t message underage children and the same underage kids can’t receive comments. Just so people like James Charles and Tony Lopez can’t contact CHILDREN. Both creators are still allowed to have a platform on TikTok and make money off it. It’s sick. They won’t ban the people that are actually harmful.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-24T12:53:30-07:00
6158258828,.Racket.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1155942861,16.6.1,5,Needs a few changes but is overall and app I love,"The only problem I have that gets pretty annoying is that the fyp (for you page) and the following page are now set up so that you can swipe right from the fyp to get to the following page and left from the following page. This seems good at first that you don’t have to click the following or fyp buttons to get there, however if you have had the app for a while you know that it used to be whatever page you’re or (fyp or following) you used to just swipe right to see the persons account and other videos. Which leads to the inconvenience, if you accidentally swipe right you lose the video you are trying to watch and most likely will not be able to find it again. If you do it on purpose and you were trying to look at their page to see if you wanted to give them a follow, then you have to go back to your personal page and go back to your last liked video. Unless you didn’t like it then you will have an extremely difficult time finding again. I find this very annoying, as I do it multiple times a day.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-04T17:31:56-07:00

Basically, a couple days ago I opened TikTok and when I went to my account I saw that my account was gone. Then I looked at my followings and I had none and then something popped up and said that my account was permanently banned because I violated community guidelines when I did absolutely nothing. I was just about ready to start crying because I had worked so hard on my account and everything was gone. Then after that I started to try and get back into my account but the same message kept popping up. I want to make a new one but I can’t because it won’t allow me to and I don’t even know what I did. I had posted a video and hadn’t posted for like 4 days but when I wanted to make a video I couldn’t. It made me really upset and it’d make me very happy if u would bring my account back. The same thing happened to one of my friends but she was actually able to make another account unlike mine. I can’t even watch other people’s videos without the message popping up. Plz make my wishes come true and bring it back. Other than that this is a great app and I love it!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-08T14:18:20-07:00
3979459346,EmberReveiw,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id983944299,10.7.0,1,Laggy and Unfair,"My TikTok doesn’t receive the latest versions of the app until a long while later and it’s not fair when people are being reported for no reason. Accounts are now using captions to warn people that it’s fake so they don’t get reported. I don’t feel that should be necessary. And going live should be an option to everyone. It’s not fair when you have to have 1,000 followers because even people without 1,000 could still have fans that want them to go live. And what’s with the whole Verification thing? I don’t get why we need that. There shouldn’t be a status rank on the app. This app is for people older than 12 and I don’t think it’s fair that the people who bend that rule have any right to report things because they are too young for that. The producer of the game should make an app similar to TikTok where it’s safe for younger kids to be on. Only kid friendly sounds and such. This way no one on TikTok will be reported for no reason. It could be called TikTok Junior or something. It could have all the same features but only kid friendly sounds and content. Sorry if you don’t agree, but those who are younger and are reporting for no reason are ruining others enjoyment. One of my videos was reported and I don’t cuss, or have any gore on my page. If a video is reported, it should actually be reviewed and looked at by a real person.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-06T16:43:17-07:00
