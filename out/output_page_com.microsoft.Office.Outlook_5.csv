I conclude that Microsoft’s Outlook app is the best email/calendar app on the AppStore. It’s clean, efficient, and just gets the job done. The fact that it can separate real serious email coming in from the garbage ones, that alone makes this app worth it. I highly recommend this app.

Initially the new search design added in Jan 2018 didn’t work but now has magically come to life. Really don’t care for it though. I don’t want to search in contacts and email at same time, waste of screen space. 
Also, the unwanted contacts search shows useless results. Typing in let’s say “Chris” Pulls up a Chris I haven’t emailed for years, yet the Chris I’ve emailed 100 times in the past month is no where to be seen. I’m sure it’s some technicality between the fact that the old Chris is in my exchange as an actual saved contact and the new Chris is in my gmail only as a recent address. But none the less I feel like many of us don’t save email contacts and simply rely on recent addresses now.

Forwarding and replying should not be a problem in a Microsoft Outlook client for mail hosted in Office365, but it is a problem and fails if the message had a signature.  You have to remove the attachment (emails with S/MIME digital signatures treat the signatures as attachments, and replying or forwarding will fail unless you remove the attachment).  Another huge problem is that this app too often it will not even show attachments let alone open them (have to use webmail OWA to properly view attachments, and may need the Okta app to do that), and the app doesn’t support S/MIME for signing and optionally encrypting new emails.
