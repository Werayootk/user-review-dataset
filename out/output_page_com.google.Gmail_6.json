Anytime I delete anything I can never find it in the trash. No matter if I just deleted it, I will search the exact title of the email I got and nope it‚Äôs not in the trash. It‚Äôs like they keep all of the emails that are useless in your trash and then the emails that are important that you delete on purpose or by accident you‚Äôll never be able to find in the trash folder. This has happened to me countless times and I cannot believe that they haven‚Äôt fixed this yet.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-05T07:34:32-07:00"},{"id":"7033784583","userName":"fmj-369fthn?.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id362423766","version":"6.0.201115","score":2,"title":"i turned on notifications but i never got them and i received a 0 because of you on a test.","text":"i got a bad grade because of this app. see, i was doing this EXTREMELY important test and we had to turn it in on time. i have a strict teacher. she gave me a private comment saying that if i didn‚Äôt turn it in this instant, i would get a zero. i never got the notification even though i turned on notifications. when i turned it in 2 minutes later, it said i already got a grade, which was zero, even though i worked so hard on it. however i can get notifications from chat messages on gmail. please fix this issue. i got one bad grade from you on a really important test. i don‚Äôt want another bad grade. please fix this notification issue.\n\nthanks i would really appreciate it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-02-24T09:50:59-07:00"},{"id":"6170279594","userName":"kimqueenepic","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1085945576","version":"6.0.200614","score":1,"title":"Mrs Jordan","text":"I‚Äôm very unsatisfied with the whole gmail I‚Äôve used it for years now and I never had it hacked or anything my personal email address is gmail but I switched it up so if ppl email you and or you use that email still I‚Äôm still getting notifications that my account has been hacked and now ppl can get your email address and use it to spy on your email and information it totally should not be experiencing the complications I‚Äôm a blogger I understand that ppl want to act like you I woke up and all my information was synced to another phone and now it says I have 3verfications when I only have two step authentication it is hard to change everything but I have personal things like legal issues and their getting my whole information thank you for the start and I will appreciate if someone can email me to address the issue thank you","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-07-07T18:28:53-07:00"}]
