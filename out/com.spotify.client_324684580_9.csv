Theres a good organization involved with the display and youre able to discover any type and style of different kind of music/ podcasts. The only issue which is constantly a burden is the lyircs not being available. Realistically speaking , only 15 out of every 30 songs actually show you the lyrics otherwise it says that the lyrics arent available. I’d understand if they were underrated songs and unknown but the songs are popular and nearly in every category of the songs’ style. It ranges from hip hop and country to christan and gospel music that this issue remains and reappears. Lyrics are the only distinct thing to Spotify, although it’s a neat app, it’s nearly like every other music app. Props to those who sync the lyrics and load them; I’m not worried about the sycning, I’m worried about not being able to post songs based off their lyrics or show others how much the artist says stuff that one is able to relate to. A counterclaim that could be said is that I can just share the song and have them listen to it, but no one is really gonna listen to a song 3 minutes long when they wanna listen to their songs, so simply being able to select the lyrics and share them and have them read it is the more convenient thing to do. Spotify please add more lyrics to the songs yall upload 🙏",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T21:28:09-07:00

I tried it free with adds and it was interesting to say the least. The cons of free I didn’t mind much but not being able to download songs was annoying. But its free so what do you expect??? Free downloading no adds??? I mean come on people nothings free. So for free I thought it reasonable. But then I figured out how cheap it was to have the all Spotify premium subscription and I was awestruck. The price was so reasonable I could pay for it myself when I wasnt making alot for a 15 year old. When I got it I enjoyed every bit of Spotify music and I never stopped using it. The music I found using Spotify helped me through so many tough days that are just normal for a teenager to go through while growing up.

I grew up when streaming services weren’t really a thing, and when I discovered Spotify, it was a game changer. I’ve been using it ever since. 
Now, for a brief few months I decided to cancel my subscription and use Apple Music exclusively since I was part of my family subscription. It’s definitely gotten better over the years, but I ultimately fell back to using Spotify. Here’s why:

The auto generated playlists are vastly superior to AM. If I’m in a music drought, there is always music I can find that I enjoyed previously. 

The continuity between devices is so fluid and non existent on AM or any other streaming service. You forget how great it is when you don’t have it. AM also doesn’t have a good desktop app.
 
Podcasts on Spotify have been integrated a lot better since first introduced. It’s so convenient to have both music and podcasts in one place. ADDITIONALLY, I am loving the free audiobooks. I don’t know how Spotify managed to give us audiobooks without extra cost, but it’s also been an amazing addition. 

Being able to see tour dates and merch is also great considering Spotify is notorious for paying pennies to artists. This feature has definitely helped me find concerts that I didn’t know were coming up. 

There are, of course things that could improve, but given what Spotify has built over the years is commendable. It’s easily, in my opinion, the best streaming platform.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T18:09:59-07:00
