Not only has it been a source of entertainment and information, but it's also connected me with a community of like-minded individuals who have become friends and even a support system for me. What I love about Reddit is that it truly has something for everyone. No matter what your interests are, there is a subreddit for it and a group of people who are passionate about the same things. It's a place where I can have meaningful discussions and learn about new perspectives and ideas. But it's not just about the content on Reddit. The app itself is user-friendly and constantly improving. I've never had any major issues with it and the updates always bring new features and improvements. Overall, Reddit has been a integral part of my life for the past decade and I can't recommend it enough. If you're someone who loves to learn, connect with others, and be entertained, then Reddit is the app for you. Thank you to the team at Reddit for creating such an amazing platform.

Edit: Fix the issue where when im on safari and click on a Reddit link it takes me to the App Store. I have Reddit downloaded!!! Stop making it unintuitive.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-04T17:29:31-07:00

Although frustrating, I have gotten used to having to google search my questions/communities BUT what really begins to frustrate me is that when I search in safari, 99% of the time I have to open it in app to view the posts which is always such a process. I have to click ‚Äútake me to app‚Äù and it always takes me to the App Store- it never actually opens in app. Then, what‚Äôs even more annoying is there are so many updates that before I can even enter the app I have to wait for the app to update for the millionth time. And mind you, I search for answers on Reddit more than I probably should so I have to do this process of updating the app and then click at least 5 times to take me to the app before it even opens in the app!! Like it doesn‚Äôt register the first few times and just takes me to the App Store where I press ‚Äúopen‚Äù only to be brought to the main Reddit feed and not what I searched for. So while I am unable to read it on safari I am also unable to read it in the app. Super frustrating!

When on the home feed, leave the app momentarily and go back into it, the home feed is scrolled back to the top instead of where you were. Sometimes won‚Äôt play media. Some media automatically unmutes when played, some don‚Äôt - seems completely random. Randomly, the Home/Popular/News/Latest drop-down menu and the subscribed subs menu just disappears. Randomly, when trying to scroll down the home feed, the up swipes are interpreted as right swipes. In-app notification badge often does not automatically show up, must go into notifications tab and refresh. And oftentimes when clicking the title of a media post, it opens the media instead of going into the post. And when playing a video full screen the overlay doesn‚Äôt go away on its own, you have to tap to make it go away. Most of these behaviors seemed to have started recently, with an update of some sort. Edit: Reddit recently cut off third party apps.

Very little options, sellers control the market, quality drops, formulas get made and simplified, etc. Sorry for the digression, but I will continue to get this info out to people until we fix this entire mess, break these monopolies and bring law and order back into our government.

The ability to save videos almost never works either, unless you know the trick to go to comments, go back, press the save button again, and hope to your personal god *that* works.

Very fluid, easy to navigate to my favorite subreddits quickly; basically does everything I‚Äôd expect from a Reddit client. HOWEVER, there is one feature that drives me absolutely batty. The scroll button. You know the one. The one where you accidentally click it and it sends you to the bottom of the thread you‚Äôre currently reading. There is already a perfectly good feature for this: pressing and holding on the screen collapses the current top-level comment and all child comments. I have had this app since the day it came out and have never, not once, pressed that button on purpose. Most of the time I just stick it in the top right corner and it stays out of the way, where it still creates a minor visual annoyance, but if that was all that happened I would not be writing this review. No, not only can I not get rid of it, it won‚Äôt even stay where I put it. Every so often, the button will jump back to its default location, and will not let me move it above that height on the screen.

The downvote feature penalizes you for getting downvoted, such as it‚Äôll hide your comments or not let you post on certain subreddits if you don‚Äôt have enough. For example on the hello fresh subreddit, there was a question asking if they think the price is worth it and only people who agreed yes had upvotes and they downvoted anyone who said they personally didn‚Äôt feel like it was worth it. You make a thread asking a question and to have people voice their different harmless opinions, yet they got downvoted? This just proves you have to think the same mindset as everyone else, which is just not how the real world works. The downvote feature should be replaced with if a comment gets reported a certain amount of time it‚Äôs automatically deleted, since there could be racist comments or creepy ones that need to get deleted which is understandable. Yet it‚Äôs tiring to get downvoted for simple things. People will literally go as far as checking your whole post history and page just to add on to a downvote and prove their point, which is super ‚Ä¶ odd to me.

I looked up this issue and this is a HUGE problem on reddit. You literally can‚Äôt have your own opinion on this app, or say anything that will POSSIBLY upset people. And if you do, its downvotes, downvotes, downvotes. Then it will be led by subreddit banning or permanent banning. I can understand if someone was being racist, homophobic or just disrespectful.

Not only that, if they actually want to let people talk about it they can police and ban them w/o giving any reason meaning subreddits often become home to power hungry mods who ban you for disagreeing with them even if not directly. Reddit has no problem with this because the site is big enough that the people effected don‚Äôt make enough noise to cause problems for the rest of the users nor do they have any form of recourse. They can appeal to the mod team of the subreddit but they will more than likely end up talking to the person who banned them.

The community was great and there was a lot to do there until recently. One day I went on and seemed to not be able to comment or post anything. I then found out a thing called being Shadowbanned which is what reddit dose to people if they break there rules. I find this reasonable as there needs to be a moderated platform for people. I looked more into it and went to the subreddit r/shadowban to see if I was shadowbanned and turns out I was. I then took the past 30 mins to got though the comments and posts I ever made and didn‚Äôt see anything. Of course if I got shadowbanned I have to happen to break the rules somehow, so I went to the mods them self‚Äôs to not be unshadowbanned but more of what I did wrong. Unfortunately to the dismay of me they never replied so I sent them any message asking kindly what I have done. The same thing happened and to this day I still don‚Äôt know why I got shadowbanned. Though all of this I‚Äôve made 3 accounts and all shaowbanned trying to to break the rules, one of those accounts I literally made only 3 comments. I never written a Apple review before but this app has gotten me so upset I had to write a review.

However, this makes no sense for Reddit. After you open a video in a subreddit, swiping on it will give you a random unrelated video in a subreddit you don't even follow, instead of what you would expect, which is giving you the next post in the subreddit.

To make matters worse, the new video player functions worse with fewer features. And it's been degrading with every update. There is no way to select a video quality (even when multiple are available) so most of the time it will give you a potato quality video where even the text is illegible‚Äîas a comparison, TikTok always gives me high quality videos by default. Also, some time recently a bug was introduced where if you leave the app while watching a video and then come back to Reddit you will be stuck in the video with no back button or ability to ""swipe away"" back to the feed or subreddit. The only solution is to manually quit Reddit and reopen it.

Continuously, Reddit App developers change the UI not to fix bugs but to make a worse experience for users. Reddit used to have a UI design that set it apart and was functional. Now the app is designed to emulate other social media apps and it does not fit with existing design choices. The new video player is somehow worse than the video player that existed previously (and was never fixed, despite constant bug reports). Sorting options have been removed from the top of the tabs and placed within the profile menu (and only lets you sort for home now). That means instead of one click to sort, it‚Äôs now three. They‚Äôve decided, in their infinite wisdom, to change how the upvote, comment, and share buttons are displayed. Instead of across the entire bottom of a post, spread out so you know what you‚Äôre clicking, it‚Äôs all now squished to the bottom left of the post.  They choose to overhaul the design of the UI repeatedly, straying further and further away from what made Reddit unique while not fixing any of the existing issues.

Unfortunately now I can‚Äôt even do that because the video keeps looping, which turns my comment reading session into a torture session. Come on, is that tiktok ripoff trend so lucrative that you have to jump on it too? Nobody on Reddit wants tiktok on the platform‚Äîif they did they‚Äôd be using tiktok. Stop trying to be like the social media giants and go back to being your own thing! That‚Äôs why your user base exists and you‚Äôre gonna lose a lot of us if you keep making these awful choices. 

Ok but for real, the video player UI is just awful. On everything else the upvote/downvote buttons are on the left, but on the video player they‚Äôre on the right. The pause button is tiny. Pressing the ‚Äúcomments‚Äù icon takes you to the video instead of the comments, and to read the comments you have to pause the video first (if you care about your sanity). Scrolling on the video no longer takes you to the comments but to another random video.

However, I have one minor annoyance that's grown into a major gripe over time: whenever I use Safari to Google search something, and a Reddit post is in the search results, if I click the link there's a pop-up that says ""See Reddit in..."" and I have the option to open the page in the Reddit app or continue with the web browser. My problem is, whenever I try to open the page in the Reddit app, I'm sent to the app store as if I hadn't installed the app. I have never been able to open a link from Safari in the Reddit app, and I've tried everything. The app is up to date, I've tried opening the app before clicking the link and it still won't take me to the app. 

Honestly, if this was fixed I'd give 5 stars. The Reddit app is really good. But this is just so annoying, and it's difficult to search for a specific post within the app so there's no real workaround. So I'm just hoping the devs see this and find a way to fix it.

I frequently purchased coins to give away fake internet awards, I purchased many of their collectibles and I finally started paying for premium. I much preferred Reddit over other social media apps like Discord and Twitter, but that all changed thanks to my experience these last few months. I was just before my two year cake day and ended up with something I‚Äôm told is an ‚ÄúIP ban‚Äù a ban evasion that never occurred because I was no longer banned in the sub at the time the comments were made. 

It all started after I was unbanned from a community and as soon as I posted my first comment in that sub, I received a temporary ban. After the temp ban was over, I reached out to the subreddit mods and to support to make sure that I was officially in the clear to make comments in that sub again. The mods said I was fine, but Reddit support never responded. I took a chance and made a comment on that sub again and, boom‚Ä¶.permanent ban. I have made multiple requests to support with zero response, other than ‚Äúthe ban stands‚Äù. It‚Äôs as if nobody is reading or investigating what I have been explaining.

Another thing is inbox messages you can‚Äôt delete them from your reddit inbox meaning they‚Äôll stay there until you delete your account completely.

Prior to this I was using the official Reddit app. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhate‚Äù the official app, but in comparison to so many apps in the App Store, it felt very behind and lackluster. Bad loading times, the UI was horrible, and just an overall poor experience that I put up with because ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better.‚Äù After switching to Apollo on a whim, I found a solution to every single issue the official Reddit app had for me at the time. Everything, every little detail, was so thought out. The UI, the gestures to comment, upvote/downvote, etc. was so useful and felt so natural on an iPhone. 

However, Reddit has forced Apollo to close, and I decided to give the official app another go. While it improved since I last used it, it certainly is not the best app to use Reddit on. That one is gone, all by Reddit‚Äôs own doing. Reddit should really take what Apollo did so well and use that to build onto their own app. The little details do go a long way, and I genuinely believe the Reddit app could benefit by taking these details and working them into their app. But the fact that they are, for lack of better term, forcing this decision to use a much worse app is truly a shame.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-03T19:51:57-07:00

Long time Reddit users have almost always hated the official app, but I never really understood their problem with it. I liked the UI, and there were a bunch of useful QoL features that other Reddit apps didn‚Äôt have.

That is no longer the case. ~1.5 years ago every update started breaking or outright stripping those features. They‚Äôre always small changes. No one change really makes that big of an impact. Things like no longer being able to change the view (card, normal, compact) on search results, the weird comment ‚Äòtray‚Äô that prevents you from swiping horizontally between posts, the endless compatibility issues with various embedded video hosting sites, etc. 

The official app isn‚Äôt as broken as some people make it out to be. However, I still advise that new users not climb onboard the sinking ship. Any features you like/get used to in the official app will be removed before long, and there will be no way to get it back.

You know how to tap 3 buttons to get to the menu vs the original 1. Why would they change this? Incompetence.

The best thing about Reddit was that it was a social media platform that didn‚Äôt *feel* like a social media app, but now they‚Äôre moving in that direction with their exclusive, dumb ideas.

Reddit‚Äôs suggestions only add to the clutter. That I can disable these suggestions is beside the point. I am able to decide for myself what I want to see and participate in.

Even more frustrating are the icons at the top of my feed that notify me there are live audio conversations in various subreddits. Although I‚Äôd disabled every so-called feature that seemed remotely related, I could not rid myself of these icons. I wondered, did I have to visit each individual subreddit to disable these? Are they permanent UI fixtures? The answer to the last, according to a comment on a changelog post, is yes. For now, at least, and for too long. The team ‚Äúwill be building a toggle‚Äù to opt out of the live bar. They implemented the feature and didn‚Äôt bother to provide users a choice in whether to participate.

There‚Äôs an annoying little orange dot that won‚Äôt go away until I look at it. Multiple times per day it gives me a little notification about subreddit chats or something. I‚Äôve literally never used subreddit chats and do not want to.

This is by far the most frustrating app user experience I‚Äôve encountered.

update: now it‚Äôs not even possible to get the mobile website to stop asking you to download the app. do yourself a favor and just quit reddit altogether. ask yourself why a company that basically only makes money on advertising is so insistent that you download their app, to the extent that they are removing features from their formerly functional website to influence your decision.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-04T11:06:34-07:00
