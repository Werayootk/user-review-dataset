I was constantly playing with my friends and I had a lot of fun with it. It was always highly enjoyable to stab my friends in electrical, or nervously run around doing tasks while you suspect everyone. And even when I stopped playing as often, I would still revisit it quite a bit for two more months before I had to focus on school.

Well, now that it‚Äôs summer, I wanted to play again. Especially after the updates with the new map and new colors. And I tried to play. But the chat feature doesn‚Äôt work at all. Every time I tap it, nothing comes up. I can‚Äôt talk to the other players at all, and I end up getting voted out as a result. It‚Äôs not fun that way at all. I want to talk and tell them what I see. I‚Äôm not malicious towards other players unless they say something rude first. But my chat doesn‚Äôt work in any of the maps. I can‚Äôt play it anymore because of this chat issue, and I don‚Äôt have it downloaded anywhere else. 

I tried to join the discord server to fix it. I waited for ten minutes and agreed to the rules but it didn‚Äôt work, so I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I really like this game and want to keep playing it, but can‚Äôt if I can‚Äôt talk to the other players.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-26T20:41:08-07:00

I am not rating it based on gameplay, because that would mean that it would be five stars. My  2 star review is because of the community. Now, the reason it‚Äôs not 1 Star is because I met some really good people. Like IJevI, they were kind, friendly, and nice. They wouldn‚Äôt even kill me if he was the impostor. He would legit kill everyone else and leave me be. So I did the same. But on the other hand, ITS RADIOACTIVE ‚ò¢Ô∏è X TOXIC X 1,000,000. I‚Äôve seen people being racist, trolls, hackers, cheaters, discord tryhards (people who cheat by letting their friend get killed and their friend tells them who it is), and more. That is absolutely unacceptable. I am not giving up among us, just warning y‚Äôall of the murky waters ahead if you get this. Add friend system!!! I want friend system!!! Don‚Äôt do so in the next update, and I am telling my friends it‚Äôs a bad game, it is sparse in terms of account management (cuz there is no account managements or accounts at all) it has a toxic community, and can have bad connections sometimes. Edit: well, thanks for adding anonymous options! It will help a lot in games. I also appreciate you adding symbols to the wires for those colorblind people. Still, add a friend system.

I love this game. I love the concept, the fact that you can play with friends, and of course the cute little characters. However, recently I‚Äôve been having quit a few issues with the game that is causing me to not want to play. First of all, I have probably played around 10-15 games today. I was not an imposter in a single game! To me, that is just not right. I understand that the imposter is probably chosen by random, but there has to be a better system. Let‚Äôs be honest, most people really want to play the imposter, so when every single game you join, your assigned a crew mate it can become extremely frustrating. My second problem with this game is even more frustrating. Whenever I purposely log out of a game I‚Äôm not allowed to join another game for 15 minutes!! That is extremely annoying because I obviously logged out the game for a reason. Like today I logged out because I had to go to a class, and I didn‚Äôt have enough time to finish the game.

I understand that you want to have your game more kid friendly but the quick chat system is very confusing and not much could be said. For example, I was playing a game once and it was super funny on how it ended so i wanted to express how i felt about and congratulate the people who won but i couldn‚Äôt, didn‚Äôt find anything that‚Äôd fit what i wanted so i gave up. 

A way to better this is by making it how it was before? I think that was better than right now because it feels like you either make the choice to struggle with finding what you want or just or respond. Yes, i know the will inappropriate, immature, rude people (mainly early teens/tweens) will still be messing up the game in their ways but do you have to bring it down to this?

Then a meeting starts and you can‚Äôt chat, or you get Spohn killed because you couldn‚Äôt load on time but then everyone suspects you to since you are near a body basically let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in the situation i just talked about.  should I just put it out that this glitch is really annoying and frustrating to deal with I need to be fixed ASAP.

I‚Äôve always liked murder mystery types of games so I really enjoyed playing this. However, the new update sorta ruined it for me. You can‚Äôt chat freely unless you log in to your account, give an email address, or if your under the age of 13. And yeah, I understand why they did that; there were lots of people cursing, saying terrible words, cyber bullying, online dating, etc. But it‚Äôs still annoying. You can only say certain things and I can‚Äôt ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when someone accuses someone of being imposter. Plus, you can‚Äôt change your name freely either unless your logged in or at least 13. Again, I get why they did that, but I‚Äôd like it if you could just censor inappropriate names or tell that player that the name is inappropriate (same for the chat; you could just censor what the player is saying). To avoid the chat problem, you could just play with friends in a voice call. But some people (like me) don‚Äôt have many friends who play Among Us or video games in general. I would really appreciate it if you could just censor inappropriate stuff instead of not letting players say what they want :]",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-18T08:14:46-07:00

If you can make something to give them a warning that would be great! sometimes when I‚Äôm impostor or just a crew mate I get kicked out for no reason. It says ‚Äúkicked out game due to issue‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need to update among us‚Äù but when I go to see if I need to update it it‚Äôs false information. People also flirt on among us or say they will track you down. I know you can‚Äôt do anything about the flirting but can you maybe ban or kick the people that say they will track you down. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I know they can actually track you done but it‚Äôs scary when people say that you. Overall this game is very very fun. I recommend maybe adding a free pack for like a baby. The pack costs 4$ I think. I don‚Äôt wanna waste money on a game I‚Äôm not gonna play forever. Can you make a free pack? Maybe it can just be a baby or even just a stickman! Maybe you can add new colors. You can also add more cams? Not in rooms but maybe add a cam in weapons and cafeteria and communications. You can also add at least 2 more rooms. Maybe a restroom and the task is to put toilets next to eachother. This game is overall one of the funnest game to play with friends and family.

In the new update it makes you have to put an age! Which 99.9% of kids just put older ages.  Instead of doing this you should have made players have to put in some information, meaning young kids would have to have there parents sign in for them. And now that in the hypothetical situation only parents and older teens can log in there should be an option to have the quick chat on or off, and if you have it on you will ONLY be able to play with others that have it on so it will be age appropriate, meanwhile teens are teens so yea... also I would like to address the random name situation. I HATE the random name since I was ‚Äúsonic the hedgehog‚Äù and now I‚Äôm Fredrick!!!!!!! (not even my name IRL-) so I think if you during the time you put information you are allowed to put a custom name, therefore adults can make there children‚Äôs name and teens can make there own name.

Also some people refuse to do tasks. And I was in a game and one of the imposters told EVERYONE who was the imposters and they were even wrong because they weren‚Äôt the imposter but it was really unfair because that person was right. Some ideas would be if you could figure out some way to A. Make it so the imposter cannot say who the other imposters are ( provided if there is more than one ) and I think two other things would be great, the first is make there other game modes, what I mean by this is like where you can do hide n seek, or tag or something like that, people have been getting creative and making the games into that but it would be fun if people could choose modes another thing that would be really really amazing would be if the imposter could get special knifes and you could also rank and you can build maps, I think being able for us to build maps would be sooo cool!

I always have a good time with my friends or online with strangers. The work done in this game by the four staff members of InnerSloth blows my mind. I'm posting this review prior to the release of the Airship update, which I've heard will release later today. I can only hope they resolve some issues, especially with Polus. The cameras on Polus are extremely glitchy. As you may have seen in other reviews, anything that moves makes a trail of itself across the screen. Another problem with Polus is for mobile players, like myself. When outside, the ground layer glitches out, hiding names and the edges of the map. This helps in no way when I'm playing as the impostor. A frustrating glitch on any map occurs when people leave. It upsets the algorithm, and when the game ends, it just shows a black screen. You then have to restart your game to play again. There is also a glitch with mid-game kicking. It seems one players kick vote may not register to another. This has only occurred a few times for me, but I just wanted to put it out there. Again, I hope that the developers fix this in the next update that drops today. Thank you, InnerSloth, for this wonderful game.

YOU BANNED THE BLANK NAME. Why? Why? Whyyyyy? Also, the people call emergency meetings (people as in the modders) and say ‚ÄúThis guy is the impostor I saw him vent‚Äù AT THE START OF THE GAME! and, people cheating? OHHH YES THERE IS! People are on discord, and they are on a call. So when a impostor kills one of the people on their call? THEY CALL A EMERGENCY MEETING AND SAY ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs (this color) my friend on discord told me.‚Äù It‚Äôs stupid. Also people are dating. Thats unfair. And another thing is the ping.

I don‚Äôt understand this update at all and I don‚Äôt know who prefers this version. I feel that it is very difficult now to play and the old version of the game was much better.

The first few weeks were great until....it became popular. The community with in the game itself is very racist, homophobic, and just toxic in general. Also because of how popular it has become their are more hackers. I feel that their should be forbidden words that will prevent you from joining games for one hour if you use them more than 5 times. I try to spread positivity in the chat reassuring people that it‚Äôs just a game no need to get mad. But... when I do I just get called racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and horrible names in general. When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave. Teaming is a HUGE issue in the game with entire groups of friends outing the imposters as soon as the game starts. The emergency button is used too often... or often use it to SAY HI!!!

If you‚Äôve ever seen the game paladins  or games like it , that‚Äôs the type of friend / party system I think would be the easiest to implement. It would automatically put in 10 random people in too ever round/ game you would make your party before the round starts one of your friends in the group party would be the leader and pick which game the group wants to be in all of them would get automatically placed in with a game that needs like 4 or more people or however many people you have in you‚Äôre party.

I love your guy‚Äôs games Im a really big fan of the Henry Stickmin Collection too. So I have been playing this game since it got really popular last year, and I absolutely love it! I am so obsessed with Murder Mystery‚Äôs, so this game is perfect for people like me. I love the new role and Cosmicube update too, I really think this will bring it back. I have a few request though, Could we possibly get a hide n seek mode? I really like playing Hide n Seek on among us, it‚Äôs good for when you are playing privately with friends and their aren‚Äôt a lot of people. But is also quite annoying when I join a server and people are playing hide n seek without letting me know. I feel like if there was a section for hide n seek in the map section it would be easier for people to find/stay way from. Next, when I was on the shop, I saw a new pets section, I know we already have the Airship and PLENTY of Henry Stickmin outfits, But could we PLEASE get a Charles Calvin, Burt Curtis, and Reginald Copperbottom pet?

I also looked at the negative reviews and see that they share the same issue quite a bit but I rated a five star because the only issue is that some people exploit the game. One such example is when your about to press the meeting button and you get killed in the meeting. I have seen it at the point of view and see that the ping of the game is slow and that keeps the person with low ping outside of the meeting. So while players are chatting, the person could walk around and if it was the imposter then they could kill you inside the meeting. This issue rarely occurs due to the newer update. One concern I have is with the banning/kicking in the servers. I was playing and people would be mad a kick you for playing the game. Could you maybe look into this and have a box where you had to type out the reason for banning/kicking. It might not work and people will still be people but overall it‚Äôs a good game and deserves more good attention.

But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I‚Äôm crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn‚Äôt let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat. Anyway I joined a game and my screen turned black when the game started again! So I deleted the app, reset my phone, and reinstalled it and the same things happened again! So, now I guess I can‚Äôt play among us anymore. It used to be so fun, but now I can‚Äôt even play it. üò° so, I gave it more than 1 star because it‚Äôs fun, but no more than 3 stars because I can‚Äôt play it anymore.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-01T12:18:18-07:00

Another thing is sometimes I will get kicked out because I have an old version of among us but I don‚Äôt have an update for among us it‚Äôs weird but it happens all the time it gets kind of annoying and I don‚Äôt think you guys can fix this but when a lot of people leave the game it makes an automatic win to the imposters but other than all that the game is so fun I play it every day all day!!!! Oh ya one more thing could you make it so after the game when it says waiting for host could you make a timer for that and if the host doesn‚Äôt come in that amount of time then it kicks out the host because so many times I have been sitting and waiting for the host for at least 5 minutes before I leave the game.

This game has great gameplay and is less laggy and more interactive than other games. I‚Äôve been playing it for a few months now and I usually get bored over games quite fast, however, among us never gets old. Definitely one of the best games on the app store and quite simple to understand. However, with a game comes some bugs, and i‚Äôve come across quite a few.

After being in the lobby, I encountered a game-breaking bug that makes the game unplayable. Once the round starts. the back of the ship (across from the seats)are at the spawn of the game, specifically the emergency meeting button in the skeld. the server stats that are on the left in the beginning are there too, which made it impossible to see tasks and you couldn‚Äôt even open and close task bar. It happened for other people because nobody could move by where the back of the ship, and everyone left. Though this is one of very little bugs, it is game-breaking and i‚Äôve encountered it twice. I have screenshots of the bug, and i would be happy to share them in hopes it can be fixed. Other than that, among us is a great game, and definitely recommend it for anyone who likes action-packed gameplay.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-16T23:58:14-07:00

Then I would put more people in the lobby because the whole point and fun of being imposter is killing and getting away with it so at least add more players in the three imposter games and the two imposter games. This game needs more colors to choose from also and if people want to team then make a game that has teams like a duo match or squad match because teaming is annoying if you don‚Äôt want it in your game and this goes back to what I was saying about the more positions if you have more positions then the game will be more exciting because you know that most of the time you won‚Äôt be a crew mate because honestly how many games does it take to get imposter. I think if we don‚Äôt get more positions in the game then we should at least have something else for the crew to do other than tasks and getting killed. But honestly this game has changed my life because I have something to do in my free time now and plus this game is addicting so great job and keep up the good work and keep making the world happy.

For starters, the quick chat update a few weeks ago wasn‚Äôt that good and made the game feel weird since a few of the other people were using it and it was pretty clunky. Then yesterday when they released the airship map and account system, you can‚Äôt add friends and it won‚Äôt let me free chat when I put my age as 23, which is how old I am. Not to mention that the new map is way to big for 10 people and has very slow animations to travel with the ladders and floating paths. I remember playing this with my friends back in November and now I don‚Äôt really want to play it. They should make more roles and bigger lobbies since that would make the game feel more fresh and fun again. I‚Äôve seen YouTubers like Disgusted Toast and Corpse use mods like the morpher and the jester so the devs could use those with some minor adjustments to make them fit more in the game. They could also make the lobby size 12 or 15 just to keep the new map faster than it already is since games on that map take like ten minutes then the regular 3-5 minutes with any other map.

After meeting a nice person and play a few rounds with them, you can‚Äôt find a way to interact with them any other way, except by friending them on a social media app. I would love if you added friends to this game, and an invite button.

And there‚Äôs no kind of anti cheat system, playing the game and winning is impossible, and quite frustrating.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. 
While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  
As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. 
For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints. Thank you!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-01T10:45:45-07:00

Many problems that have been listed in reviews I barely experience, maybe I'm just lucky or people are exaggerating, but I noticed the top review talks about a game breaking bug. Now, there are game breaking bugs, but they are easily solved by quitting, closing the app, then opening it up again, and bugs like that are rare and are getting fixed constantly. It is a good game and concept, people are toxic sometimes, but that's every multiplayer game ever. This game works fine, and I actually strangely don't get adds, I didn't pay for no adds, but I just don't get them. This game has no reward system, so cheating is pointless, and if the settings are bad, leave before it begins. I have never had a problem with not being able to join for leaving to many games, and I think as long as you don't take offense at the dumb things people may say to you online, you'll be tine and there won't be much reason to leave. It's just a game, nothing anyone says or does matters, but still don't be a jerk. This game is pretty good, and even with all the normal dangers and downsides that normally come with online games, this one is pretty good.

I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn‚Äôt fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don‚Äôt have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids. It really takes something away from the game when most of the people are stuck to a few sentences that doesn‚Äôt even include some vital stuff to the game, as mentioned before with the inability to ask for people to see them do a visual task.

It‚Äôs amazing and so much fun to play with friends!! But no game is perfect and this one could definitely have some updates! 1.) Currently the highest amount of players that can play in one game is 10:( this is fine if you are playing online or with a small group of friends but when you have a group of more than 10 people it‚Äôs basically first come first serve. I know that if you had unlimited people the game would take a longggggg time but I also think that sometimes you figure it out so quickly it‚Äôs not very fun. I suggest making the player capacity 20 this would make the game more challenging and more fun especially when playing with a friend group. 2.) Right now there is 12 basic colors red, green, orange, yellow, etc. and a small section of hats. I really wish they would add more colors and hats!!! 3.) Currently there are very few tasks that people can watch you do and not everyone has the same tasks so you can‚Äôt always do visual. I think it would help if you added a few more visual tasks.

You get voted out for being too quiet, or lose a game because you can‚Äôt say what you want. For example if you see Red kill Blue, but Blue leaves after they are killed you can‚Äôt say Blue anymore. Also for the younger kids they don‚Äôt always know all of the words, whereas when they type they can spell out words they know and at least get their point across in simple phrases. I get why quick chat is a thing, too many people were cursing or using foul language; but it doesn‚Äôt seem right to overhaul the game because of bad operators.

I know most of my friends kinda stopped playing for a while just because they can‚Äôt explain what they saw, or did in the chat. Yes, I understand that the reason why they blocked off chat is because people were using this app as a way to give unnecessary/inappropriate information, but it still took some of the fun away from the game.

Edit : Though as I‚Äôm now editing this in 2023, inersloth or someone else has taken all of the roblox versions down. But again I‚Äôm editing in 2023 and sparked new interest in the game again. They have fixed most of the things I hated about the game. I can chat freely again, I finally was able to redeem some of my purchases, and they‚Äôve even added a new map. There is 1 thing I do have a slight problem with but it can be overlooked if you look at fact. That problem is the micro transactions, they are mostly unfair to other players of how you can‚Äôt afford the purchases. But roblox does the same thing, and this game is free, so they have to make some sort of income from this. A great and fun game again, is what I‚Äôm trying to say.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-01T10:11:17-07:00

Also with the 3 different maps you can change between makes it hard to get bored.  There is only a couple things that I don‚Äôt like about this game which include hacking which ruins the game outright, but because of its insane popularity I can understand that there will be a few hackers.  However, the devs are doing a amazing job with banning hackers and I recently have been in no games that had hackers.  Another thing is the server list, with the games constant player count when you open the server list some servers that load onto your screen that say they are 9/10 are already full, this just sends you back to the main menu with a message saying you can‚Äôt join that server.  However, this is easy to get around by just picking the servers are 4-5 down the list, they normally only have 6/10, but by the time you join they will mostly have a full server ready to play.  Other than those couple complaints everything about this game is great and I love it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-10T08:39:37-07:00

The first time I played it I thought it was boring but as I kept playing it just kept getting so much more fun! I have some request that I hope you can add to the game. First of all, I really want a way to like friend people so you can play with them all the time because I meet people that I enjoy playing with, but then I never get to play with them again. Second, I wish there was a way to report people when they ask for personal information. Lot‚Äôs of people ask for my number or my name and I really don‚Äôt like it. It scares me and I don‚Äôt ever know what to say. Third, I think that if it‚Äôs possible, can you add another map? I don‚Äôt know why I want another map because the only one that I play good on is the skeld. Fourth, can you please add more hats and colors because there‚Äôs not a lot of colors, and when you join a game sometimes a person already has the color you want. I play with my name as Strawberry and lots of times I don‚Äôt get to be red. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt like Among Us I love it, but I think you could add some things to it.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and a great way to entertain yourself. I would like more features like coins, more colors, friend system, etc. (Which I know the developers can‚Äôt do everything, just some ideas) Anyways I wanted to report an issue I have with the game. I am on a iPad mini 2. Now I would absolutely love to get a new iPad but I can‚Äôt get it at this time. My iPad has 11.9 GB to 16 GB at this moment, though my game keeps crashing. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the type of iPad or whatever but it‚Äôs very annoying. This same thing happens to my brother and we both have the same type of iPad. I‚Äôve tried shutting down my iPad, deleting stuff, deleting the app and reinstalling, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work. The crashes happen while I‚Äôm doing a task, just walking, but it usually happens when I try to use the chat. I just wanted to put this out there so someone can investigate this, I don‚Äôt know if this happens regularly to other people but my friends don‚Äôt have this problem.

Also sometimes when I play we cannot even find the imposter cause we can‚Äôt say a lot like if I saw someone vent and host a meeting it would take me so long to find what I wanted to say that everyone already voted me off! Like UGH! üò§And it‚Äôs really unfair that I cannot change my name, like  when the update first happened I just pressed ‚Äúrandomize name‚Äù joking and thinking I could change my name again but then I couldn‚Äôt like they give me names that I would never in my life use.

It was fun and simple. I used to play it with my friends way back. Recently, I went on the app, and found a place that was nothing like the app it was before. First of all, there are new colors. Can‚Äôt the classic cyan and the infamous red be enough? Why do we need these extra colors? I don‚Äôt get it. And then there‚Äôs a new map. It‚Äôs very confusing. The tasks are random, and there are way too many roles. Why in the WORLD do we need extra roles? Can‚Äôt it just be imposter and crew-mate? It makes the game too confusing. And additionally, my friends stopped playing your game. We all bought the outfit pack where you get a mini among us character following us. And guess what? On my friends‚Äô devices, it didn‚Äôt even save! And they never deleted the app. And finally, there is a horrible issue that made my friends quit. What happened to the chat? Before, you could chat like a normal chat would. You type in words and it sends. But now, you have to choose from PRESET MESSAGES. The game is ruined. I don‚Äôt know why you developers changed it all, but I don‚Äôt support any of this changing.

The vent system is amazing and I love getting away with kills when someone walks in as soon as I get them cause the vent, I have even gone on rampages and still won the fact that it isn‚Äôt given a base set up that can‚Äôt be changed and host can change is amazing. I love being able to have a challenge either as imposter with high cool down and low range  to help spice it up and love being Crewmate with low vision and good amount of tasks, being able to beat the imposter by completing a series of challenges (the tasks) is so fun I love going and finishing five tasks before a body is found. The sabotage method is also cool cause you can trap people with door shutting insta win with o2 reactor and stabilizers and get rid of there field of vision by hitting lights I have even mad lights my kill zone on Skeld. So fun to be able to detective a win as crew and murder and lie myself to the W as imposter, over all a 10/10 game with such fun ways to play that makes people fall in love with it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-26T00:10:29-07:00

People saying this game is overloaded with ads are wrong. When it does give you an ad you can skip it the second it starts! If anything that is an amazing plus to the game. People that say it‚Äôs lagging are probably playing on an older phone. There is no lag in this game. There are plenty of different matches to join with many settings to choose from to matchmake a kind of match you want. There is a speech censor which make the interactions make the game seem more appropriate for everyone! The people saying I played 30 matches and still haven‚Äôt been imposters are lying. I calculated the chances to be an imposter with 1 imposter in a game. It is a 10 percent chance. So every 10 games you are definitely going to be it. But you can still be imposter before that. And if the chances are too small then customize a match to 2 imposters or 3! There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with this game! I don‚Äôt see anything wrong. A few purchases are in the game but isn‚Äôt pay to win so that‚Äôs a big plus. In the end this is an amazing and is is worthy of anywhere from a 4.8 to a 5.0 game! I‚Äôm sorry this review is so long.

Before Among Us became popular I was a normal guy, I played Geometry Dash and Mario Maker 2 competitively and everything was fine, but then it happened. I was looking around on steam out of boredom and I saw it; Among Us. I read the premise and was immediately impressed, as it sounded like a grand time, but this was only the beginning of my absolute wholehearted adoration for the masterpiece of a game that Among Us truly is. I downloaded the game, eagerly waiting for it to finish downloading. I opened it and was blasted with the coolest logo, best music and greatest menu I‚Äôve ever seen. Everything about it was perfect, and my mind was blown. Ever since I‚Äôve lived for among us, I have among us themed birthdays, porn, devices, masks, shirts, haircuts, pants, scarves, wallpaper, rugs, bath bombs, bowls, spoons, forks, plates, sex toys, and many, many more. I also met my wife and pastor in Among Us. I play for upwards of 20 hours a day and I only plan on increasing that number.

The fact that you have to log in with email to not use it is stupid too. That means i cant play with a lot of people i used to play with because people who have to use quick chat cant play with people who dont have to. Plus, people who have to play with quick chat cant even play the game the proper way. You cant even give proper information like ‚Äúred locked me in medbay and i think he was going to kill me.‚Äù So you cant play the game and give the proper information in order to win. The next problem is the game wont let me play. Sometimes, the game wont let me in. When i click on the app it kicks me out right away, before i can even do anything! And the days it actually lets me in, i cant even complete a game! It randomly kicks me out in the middle of the game. Its VERY rare that i can finish a game without getting kicked out.
