Everything other than important stuff didn’t trigger a notification which is fine by me because I get a ton of spam. It was easier to clean up too.\n\nNext, visually Inbox was far better organized.

Essentially it meant that with one click you could make an email disappear from the main view but it wasn’t deleted. Just moved somewhere else.\n\nNone of that exists for Gmail. Quite frankly, Gmail hasn’t changed since it was released (visual, layout, etc). I’m not one for fix what ain’t broken but for the love of god, could we step into the 21st century?

So open gmail>tap 3 bars upper left>settings>account name>Notifications\nSet your notifications to “high priority only”.  Even though it’s set to high priority only, the badge now keeps track of all email counts.  I deleted and reinstalled the gmail app before I did this and it now works.  It’s a hack but I can’t wait for the developers to actually fix it so happy for the hack \n\n—————————————-\nApp badge still not showing notifications. A response from the developers, acknowledging the problem and making it a high priority would go a long way with the user community. ……………….. Gmail is great but when I can’t get a count of emails from the badge on my iPhone I’d say it’s broken. I don’t want to open my app just to check if I have emails. Google please fix it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-04-23T16:27:34-07:00"},{"id":"7072471083","userName":"Zzz1738","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id379767383","version":"6.0.210207","score":3,"title":"Notifications","text":"I’m not receiving any push notifications when I receive new mail. It started when I added a second account to the app the beginning of this week. \n\nThe app is updated to the latest version. I have a iPhone 11 with the latest iOS and have T-Mobile as my carrier. I’ve uninstalled the app and reinstalled. I’ve restarted the phone. I’ve turned notifications on and off for it. I’ve signed out of accounts and signed back in. Gmail is set to receive all incoming mail notifications. For the most part, I’m on Wifi. I thought it might’ve been because my phone is on low power mode but that’s not the case.

I hate it. I get so many notifications a day for promo emails. My settings say to send me notifications for “primary only” and somehow so many silly emails are getting sorted into Primary. I’m tired of hearing the notification noise, but if I turn notifications off, I’ll miss out on important emails. If I unsubscribe from the promos, I won’t have them when I need them. I’m SOL either way. This app is not organized as nicely as Inbox was. Inbox has bright colors and you could easily switch between “primary”, “promos”, “travel”, etc. it was extremely user friendly and organized perfectly. This app lacks all of those user friendly organization features. This app feels like any other email app, even the one that comes with your phone. There’s nothing special or handy about it. I’m not a fan.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-04-24T04:55:38-07:00"},{"id":"10155585753","userName":"544578098543","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id492091509","version":"6.0.230625","score":5,"title":"Love hate relationship","text":"I love it but hate that I have messages from 2006 when I started my email with Gmail \nIt’s not cool that  Forever 21 and a bunch of other stores don’t even have coupons or sales and can send me thousands of emails with expiration dates on them now I’m up to 60,000 and can’t receive anymore.\nI’ve had the same Gmail since I was 18 years old now I’m stuck deleting them one by one  \nwhen I should be able to delete all from Forever 21, at once, I unsubscribed, but I still have thousands of emails from them.

However, there is something seriously wrong with the Gmail app and it needs to be fixed immediately. \n\nWhat might that be?\n\nIt won’t let me reply to emails. Which is... kinda a big deal, seeing as that’s the entire purpose of this app! \n\nWhenever I press the reply button (whether it’s the one at the top, by the name of the sender, or the one at the bottom, next to the forward button), it takes me to a blank white screen. After a few moments, the sender information (sender, recipient, heading, etc). It allows me to edit the heading, but if I click on the large white space below it (where the previous emails and an area for my response should be) it doesn’t do anything. I’ve tried to let it load, but it never renders anything.\n\nAfter more experimentation, I’ve concluded that this only happens when you have a chain of 20+ emails. I seem to be having no difficulties with small exchanges, only the prolonged interactions. I’m not having this issue on any laptops or computers, or the Gmail site. It’s only the app.\n\nFellow app users: Thank you for reading my admittedly longwinded review.\n\nApp developers: Please get this fixed as soon as possible. My job requires a lot of immediate responses to emails, and when I’m running from meeting to meeting, it just isn’t practical to have to pull out a laptop to respond to a two-sentence email.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-11-19T05:37:18-07:00"},{"id":"5094641856","userName":"shellBhose","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id404095677","version":"6.0.190822","score":1,"title":"Latest update is a flop","text":"Right now,I would honestly give the app ZERO stars. I actually updated the app accidentally so that’s on me BUT....since then I have had repeated problems with the app not letting me “reply” to a message and oh my gosh it infuriates me so much!! I really don’t like the update anyway but to be right in the middle of an email conversation and then the app just won’t let me respond. I have deleted-reinstalled a few times in the past two weeks. It has temporarily helped but has eventually gone back to the reply problems. And today’s attempt to get it cooperating it will let me log in,see messages then when I click one to respond it gives me the screen telling about Smart Compose. I have tried to tap the “got it” bar but it’s stuck at that point. Omg!!! Fix the problem FAST please.....I have had no prior problems with Gmail until updating last week and I’m so disgusted and angry that I have had this many problems in only two weeks...maybe less.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-11-06T09:19:42-07:00"},{"id":"4541330663","userName":"fofo1800","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id956121659","version":"6.0.190602","score":1,"title":"Update/upgrade PLEASE","text":"Hi my name is Deandrew Powell \n\nUpdate/upgrade gmail /gmail app/google gmail \n\nIf you guys see this it be really appreciated\n\nI just want to say that I have a problem, every day when I use gmail I keep getting spam emails from dating emails and porn emails  and it really annoying and I think it be a great idea if you guys made a update/upgrade to gmail on all phone gmail apps and laptop gmail. \n\nI think that for this update/upgrade you guys could add a new feature we’re it would work like this .
