It is fun for grown-ups fun for kidsSo I hope you like this game as much as I do so please download it.

Every time I open the app it goes straight to an add then if for example I go to see my characters once I go back to the main page of the app u get ANOTHER add! Every time I close something there’s and ADD!!!!!!!!! Also I had a REALLY HIGH score I was about at the first level of gold and everything! Then I stop playing the app for 2 days then I updated it when I go to play the app all my progress is gone! I had a “high” score of 100! And was at the lowest rank! At the bottom of every one, also I was in the middle of a run trying to get my high score back so I used all my keys and boards I used all the head-starts I had I even bought more! Then I guess there was a glitch because right ahed of me there were three stopped trains whit no way to get around them and usually when that happens they give you those jumping boots or a jet pack or something but no! They didn’t provide me with anything to beat the stinking obstacle and I died I wasted all my boards,keys, and head starts for nothing!

This game is fun however my one problem with it is the updates. I want the original map back with some events but maybe like once a month not every time another one ends. Besides for that it’s a great no internet app. It does glitch but every other game does. Also I love playing this on long road trips. It’s summer break for me so I'm going on a lot of road trips and just going places with no internet so if you are doing that too I definitely recommend. Also I last thing WE NEED MORE CHARACTERS. I can never find a good avatar to play as so I just play as the ones I get as I unlock them. Im very girly and I also have some days where I wanna go for a goth theme and I can only find one character who has s goth outfit. I however can not find any girly avatar this isn’t a cheerleader.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-01T18:00:41-07:00

I live that there are new characters often and that there are permanent characters as well. My only thing is that all of the characters are expensive. I can manage to get the characters in a day or two but it takes a very long time. Also the keys are really rare and there are some characters that are 30 keys. I’ve had this game maybe a week so far and I have 76 keys. And with Tricky, Jake, Fresh, Spike, and Yutani you have to collect items for their outfits/them. It used to be where you collect the items from mystery boxes and pay for the outfits with keys (besides Jake because he is the first character you get). It was different for me. A lot than what I expected, because I have this game in my kindle and it was rarer than it is now.

Nowadays when I tap play to run, an ad would start right after the run begins and ruins the start of the game. Not only that, when I lose a run and it offers me an ad, it never loads up and suddenly I cannot exit out of the screen. This option used to work, however now I cannot get 100% of what I collected during runs since I'm forced to exit out of the app. One more thing- the magnetic shoes are just not it. When these shoes are collected they can be slightly useful, but if you jump with them to collect and item, you potentially run into a wall overhead. Meaning- the magnetic shoes are not compatible with the structure of the stage making it unfair to use the shoes at certain points. Overall good game except for interruption of ads and lag.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-20T08:12:52-07:00

My family thinks I’m insane and I shouldn’t play it as much as I do, but it’s my go to game when I’m bored. But, I recently had some trouble yesterday. So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn’t let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon. So, if anyone can help me or tell me what happened, that would be great, thanks.

After I clicked the iCloud option it deleted all my progress that I had just made in that run. It was very frustrating and I find it completely unfair that they would make you chose where to keep your progress. Especially since this has NEVER happened. The app also gave terrible explanations on what it would do given each option. This was extremely disheartening since I had spent a while doing the wordy weekend hunt and the token run. This app SERIOUSLY needs to start making better updates and not making the game worse. I’m extremely upset and will no longer be playing the game.

As a member of the LBGTQ community, we do appreciate the representation. On the other hand, I will have to admit you are greatly shoving it down people’s throats and only raising awareness to stereotypes of the community. The game itself is very fun and I do in fact enjoy playing it whenever I can, but I’ve also had issues with keys, the leaderboard, not saving progress, and major bugs. Basically I just want y’all to try and dim down some of the rainbows in the game, and also try and go through to fix the bugs that cause many people to quit playing. Many children play this game and although they should be taught that love is love, you should not put it in this game where they will only learn from stereotypes. That’s all of the concerns I had, and once again thank you for representation, but please do it another way.

Except as many others are pointing out, the new update is rough. For one, the new layout is confusing and quite tacky. It just looks wrong and it’s hard to find things. However, my biggest issue with this update is that it’s getting so hard to get any new characters without spending irl money. Sure, new characters beforehand cost 95,000 coins in game to buy but I was ok with that. It wasn’t impossible. Now though, every new character (or old character making a limited time appearance) is $3 to buy each. That’s ridiculous! The only way to get characters with coins anymore is to buy bundles that cost 100,000 coins full of stuff that I, at least, don’t really want. It’s completely ruined Wordy Weekends for me. Most of the fun was trying to get old characters you missed the first time but now they cost an absurd amount of real money. $3 for one fake character in a mobile app?! Seriously?!

In different levels there are different things that you can collect like in New York City there are apples and there are 🧲 for coins I think there should be a magnet for like the apples. 2. You should make the keys easier to collect. 3. There are so many ads every time I click ME I have to watch a ad it lets me skip it not sure about every one else.🤷‍♀️ 4. Characters should be cheaper some people are beginners so they are not as good at getting coins as some other people (no offense) so it’s harder for them to get hover boards and characters so I think they should be cheaper. 5.Lastly when you first start the game you should get to pick your first character for free instead of starting as Jake (especially for girls!)I hope you take this advise and make this game even better!

They really want you to connect to Facebook and spend real money, but you don’t have to do it to play the game fully. I love the wide array of characters and hoverboards and the different themes they do; it keeps it interesting. My largest complaint is the Super Sneakers. They are by far the WORST power up in the game. They are so disruptive to the flow of the game. They idea of having a higher jump is convenient, but the way the character bounces when wearing them is so off-setting for the flow of jumping and maneuvering through the obstacles. When on top of the trains, I have to roll to stop my jump so I don’t jump too far and miss the train and crash and end my run.

#1: It’s very addicting and fun to play at first, and you don’t want turn it off

#2: The top run thingy is very fun. It makes you push yourself harder and harder to beat the other people’s high score. This gets you in a competitive mood and makes the game much more fun.

#3: Unlocking characters and boards is another way to have more fun in the game. You collect keys and coins over and over until you have enough to unlock that character that you just HAD to have. This gives you another thing to work towards.

Although the game has many fun features, it also has a few problems. Here is why I left off two stars

#1: Let me set the scene: You’ve seen everybody else have subway surf, so you beg your mom to let you get it. She says yes, so you go to the App Store and download it. You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. 

#2: You can’t get all the characters. Some of them cost money , and some of them you have to have a certain social media for, and some people aren’t old enough to have FaceBook or whatever.

Overall it’s a fun game but don’t plan on it being addicting for very long",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-04-21T11:43:17-07:00

It was not nice how wolfjaegerillovewolves was being MEAN when he was talking about his conversation!

However.. this is not to leave massive hate, but seeing the LGBTQ+ flag really caught me off guard. Not only has that community gone a little wild, but there are young kids playing this game (3-9 young) and, personally, I don’t think the internet should be teaching kids about gay or transgender people, the child’s parents should have that conversation with them when they are ready. Young kids shouldn’t be walking up to their parents saying “Mom! Dad! In my game I saw a rainbow flag! And then there was another one!” And blah blah blah. Also, a lot of LGBTQ+ haters are out there (maybe playing this game) so seeing that flag in a kids game might be very off putting, considering the world is so messed up. I hope this will make you think about this in the future.

I’m addicted all over again! It’s a great game to relax to. It’s a game that isn’t too challenging, but every run is fun and once you get up to speed, you definitely have to pay attention. I love how they’re doing the rewards system now with the tokens and the season tokens. I think the ads are handled very well, where they give you extra coins or tokens if you choose to watch the ads, and they’re never more than 30 seconds. Nothing feels impossible or like it’s behind a pay wall and I LOVE that. I did buy a collection, because I love the game so much and wanted to support the devs, not because I felt like I was cornered into it.

Probably around the millions though. I also wonder what type of spray paint he is using to get such lively colors. Just amazing. I must admit I haven’t played the game long though I do see the empowerment that this could have on someone. I also wonder where this idea came from in the first place. I like the game so much.

Your comedic talent hasn't been seen since the days of Seinfeld. Your comedic charisma is so captivating I just can't stop laughing. Your father must be so proud of you, I know I would be. You may have just created the new standard for comedy for hundreds of years to come. Historians will look back at this precise moment with astonishment, trying to comprehend how anyone could have this incredible talent at comedy. Scientists will undoubtedly create the FQ, the Funny Quotient, in respect of all your comedic achievements. But none will have as much FQ as you.

First off, I LOVE Subway Surfers! And think it is a awesome game with a great concept.

The new update, is kind of graphically challenging. And I agree with the majority here when we think you could do much better!

But it is different with the new update, so instead of just tapping the chart of characters and boards, I found it better to swipe across to see the next one. 

The characters for this week are awesome! I do wish that they were more- Halloweeny? I mean, they are just monsters and hybrid humans, and that’s cool! But maybe have different costumes like princesses, or dinosaurs, or pumpkin people. It would be fun!

I also wish the subway surfers character got pets, like the policeman. Like something to follow them around.

I also wish that the boards had new powers, like a magnet, or jet pack.  

Now back to the graphics, 
When I was first playing this new update I believed the “pumpkins” for the ramps, were actually hot rocks or coal that you put in the old trains. And when I do use this map I don’t really get the Halloween vibe. 

Maybe add a ghost character!

So overall, I love the game, but think it needs some improvements, with bugs and graphics.

One of them is that when there is the three rows of strait coins, I think that you should put the magnet power up there every time. And also I would like to see the coin price for some of character and board go down a lot, Because some of the characters cost like sixty thousand coins. And also lower the the amount of items you have to get to get an new character skin. It’s too much. Anyways I just think that this is one of the best games I have played.

I’ve dedicated serious time to it, and loved every minute of it. After getting so far, I took some breaks. I came back to the game 2 nights ago to see that they added even more ads to the daily reward system (on top of already forced ads on the main screen), and a new “champion pack” that ADDS A 5X MULTIPLIER! For a game that puts so much emphasis on the leaderboard, this is destroying the free to play fanbase. The 2x coins already hurt a f2p players chances on the board, but now adding a 5x multiplier to the paying players scoring makes top f2p scores impossible. As soon as I saw that pack, I deleted the game and refuse to redownload. You will kill this game by making it a money grab, I’m sure of it.

Another thing, the little character things that make you collect an annoying amount of them to get the skin. I realize it keeps people playing the game but the amount you need compared to the amount you get is massively annoying. This last thing is something you could possibly add to make the game even more awesome. What if you could choose whether to be chased by zombies or killer robots instead of a cop? In other words, change the appearance of your pursuer. It would be so cool to be chased by zombies  on the subways. Or maybe aliens. It would make the game even more awesome.

When I got an iPad for Christmas I downloaded this first. Nothing can beat this game!! I’m a total addict to this game. I can’t stop. You also don’t need any Wi-Fi. How great is that? Get it NOW!!!! I have 4 kids, and everyday after school they want to play it! They would be fighting over my phone, and sometimes stealing it. I was so annoyed, but not surprised so I had to get them an I-Pad. Every road trip they bring it. We live in Florida so it’s usually hot. And I tell them, go outside and play, take your friends to the pool, and do you know what they say? They ask to take their iPads to the pool, i say yes because at least they’re getting fresh air! Then one night my younger one, Molly, sneaks her iPad to play. They are always trying to beat a record. This is a great game!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-08T04:35:51-07:00

I am sure why ever made it feels great honor and joy. This game was made by a dad who lost his son. He made the game in the sons honor, and I am here to tell you that your son would be very proud. You have used his passing as a way of showing others that good will always win agains evil. This game isn’t only fun and creative but the the game gives a special message to all those who feel lost and scared. The message it gives us is to never let the darkness turn of our candles. Never let our bright rays be covered by the dark things in this wicked world, but instead let’s change this world into a place where only happiness is allowed. Thank you whomever made this game because you have shown us that no matter what, good will always reign. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-07T20:38:32-07:00

Y’all are great have a nice day,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-01-16T11:41:49-07:00
7088016191,NathalyDavis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id390091931,2.13.5,3,Please read every word. 😌,"So, I just read what I believe is the very last review on this app, written Feb 5th, and I have to say that Annoyed Mom said everything WAYYY nicer than I ever could. The absolute fury that ensues within my body when I get a pair of Super (death) Sneakers and immediately slam into a bridge.. the feeling is truly something indescribable. 
Also, my cat has been missing for 3 days- this usually isn’t relevant but I could find him, get him neutered, bring him home, AND feed him a succulent salmon dinner in the time that it takes to get my score to 100k in this game. A quick question as well, what am i to do when there isnt a single ad to watch, I have gone broke for hoverboards when they are being used to ease the painfully slow speed in the beginning, and everything is overpriced? just uhhhhhh lemme know. 

All that aside, I have played this game for many years and cant wait for the new update. Hopefully it brings things up to a 4 or 5. Thank you for reading!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-10T11:17:19-07:00
2684198915,Samy Samy Sam,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id485628512,1.88.0,3,Barely any UPDATES,So I played this game for a very very very i repeat again very long time. At first it was cool and you know like fun. But when I started getting to play the game a lot then I told myself  ‘’ ever since I played the game there was barely any updates and it’s starting to get boring’’. It’s like it’s fun but not fun at the same time. 1 : is because barely any updates . 2 : TOO EXPENSIVE BRO!!! 3 : Ik know it’s kinda the same like number 1 but the police officer STYLE IS GETTING SOOO BORING  It would be cool if you can unlock new police officers !!! 4: The places are getting boring and it would be awesome if we can buy places!!!! For these reasons I keep on deleting this game but there are also some things that are good also. The reason why I wrote this review is so the game could be better!!! Hopefully you will agree and that a step up and listen to me! Well it’s your game you can do whatever you want but I’m just saying you know BUT NO MATTER WHAT I will still play Subway Suffers 🌸💖🌈🌹!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-06-12T16:26:44-07:00
