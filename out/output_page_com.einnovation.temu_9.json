Oh my goodness, I am in love with Temu! I've ordered several times in the last few months, and I have loved almost every single thing. I've gotten a ton of high-quality products. From close to art supplies and jewelry. I'm just so impressed, and my bank account hates me now. My only fear is TV gets popular and turns into wish. They were pretty great in the start, then got so popular, and then they just grew and became money, hungry, and started selling garbage and forgetting about their loyal customers. Please please please Teemu don't go by way of wish. You guys rock! Please don't ever change. You are the best!.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-14T00:43:36-07:00"},{"id":"9881547195","userName":"dorathe Explore","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id934773722","version":"1.66.0","score":5,"title":"I hate At & t","text":"I love this app and she said I can‚Äôt buy anything because I can‚Äôt download it stupid Apple has restricted me to not download anything someone reading this can please help me which is AT&T store.
