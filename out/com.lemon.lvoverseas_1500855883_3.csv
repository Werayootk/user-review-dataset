I’ve seen a lot of reviews saying “CapCut supports the Ukrainian and Russian war because they took away CapCut in Ukrainian!!!!!” Well how do you know the owner supports it?!?! You have to consider stuff. Like how would they be able to use the app right now anyway they are in the middle of war!  
And also what if there’s a bug or something in Ukrainian and they can’t use the app. Second I’ve seen a lot of things saying “it’s not synced” or what so ever but this is not a put in a photo and be done with it app though it’s very easy to use. It’s a great app and one of the best and easiest editing apps I’ve seen. It’s free though there is a premium. But you can use it without the premium! I definitely recommend this app!

I’ve been making edits and recently when i started to export them and watched them they were delayed. I tried to figure out what the problem was by trying to fix the frame rate and quality but that didn’t work. So for the past 2 months edits I’ve been making have been delayed and it makes me mad a little, to know that i worked for a couple hours on an edit that was going to be delayed and it’s been like that for quite a while. Overall the app is good and easy to use if you know how to fix the delaying problem can you get back to me asap? Thanks, this app great and awesome, Capcut has a lot of effects and transitions that are easy to use. I do recommend this app, though when you first use it it’s confusing but once you use it a lot you’ll get used to it.

	Once i was making an edit and when it has the finishing CapCut watermark clip, i added a heart where it says to add a text. Now, i started making an edit and the heart text wont go away. (The two edits are completely different.) Now when i try to play my edit, there is a <3 in the middle of my clips. I cant make it go away and i have no idea whats happening. I even tried to change the text but thats not working either, the heart is permanent. Thats the only downside about mine.

	But, you know after effects right? Well, I’m on a mobile device so i dont have after effects. But, when you add key frames on after effects, you can do a graph as-well the graphs make the key frame animations much much smoother. (I know this by watching ae/after effects edits). Is it possible if CapCut can do the graph aswell? Its ok if its not possible. Thank you!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-13T08:21:27-07:00

I also had a problem with storage. I have been making edits on this app for over a year and can’t get over the storage problem. I have deleted apps and important videos and pictures only for it to tell me that my storage is full. Also, I was wondering if you could fix the audio problem… Every time I export a video, the audio is a bit ahead of the actual video. Also, maybe you could add element 3d. Capcut keeps crashing when I’m exporting in 2k-4k quality. I absolutely hate  Capcut pro though.

        In my opinion, I hated how it was so hard to make an advanced edit, such as transitioning, coloring and texts. The fact that I actually had to go to another app to get the texts i wanted sucked. I need the texts just to be detailed and so i dont have to get new ones. Another concern i have in this topic is when I make animations theres always a blue line which means I cannot freely animate or move anthing around.  This infuriates me when trying to animate and move my characters around. especially when I am really dedicated to it. These are all the things i do not like at all.

     L I K E S
           I like how there are templates to use because some people cant edit. I like how the templates let you use your own photos and texts and videos too. i like how you can make it longer to see the effects you’ve set to 0.1. Its just so satisfying so you can see it better too. There are many choices for filters and effects. The overlays have many choices on how it wants to appear too .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-19T15:05:14-07:00

I don’t have to pay for anything. Although, I have seem some problems lately. First of all, we do not need this many fonts. Half the time some of them don’t even work. If you’re going to continue to add more, please add a “favorites” section for the text. It would be really useful because I only have two major fonts I use so scrolling through, trying to find them, gets annoying. Also, if I am working on a edit and I mute the sound for The whole thing, I USED to be able to change the volume on other clips. For some reason I can’t do that know? It’s really annoying having to go through ALL the clips and mute them just because I needed one to have sound. It would be really nice if you could stop adding so many texts and features to the app. It’s supposed to be simple and the more and more stuff you add, the more complicated it will become.

I tried removing the picture and replace it with the same drawing but as an overlay and it still thinks I’m using pro version! Even though I deleted it. So I tried to remove the filter again, again and again and still won’t work. I was very like mad and sad because I really wanted to export my video.

TikTok. They say you need TikTok for everything! And I don’t have TikTok.

Step two: Share it from CapCut to TikTok with the hashtag #editmewithcapcut. It made me very mad. I also found out that to make a profile on CapCut to show everybody your templates and everything in your own edits that you made you also have to have a TikTok account and it just makes me very mad. Otherwise, I make edits every day and it’s a lot of fun to just go back and watch them and like to see every day how I’d like learned to make my edits better and how I can still look at templates and uses to make even more edits so that I don’t always have to make my own.

Because of the title of the review, I just want to make a suggestion with the retro option in the video effects. Do you know about the “TV Lines” effect? Well, I was hoping you can make a similar effect where it is held on the frame option. What I want how the effect to look is the same as Videoleap’s one where one of the glitch effect is called CRT. I want that effect to be the exact same as Videoleap’s if that’s possible to you, that’s basically all I ask for honestly.

The text and overlay limited options for a first. It doesnt give out the same options as it does for the first pic/video, all i want is the effect option to be presented so i can chrome key less during the process 

With the overlay, it has some problems with handmade cover filters made in another program, especially when the filter uses a blending mode (multiply, color dodge, pin light, ect) and is in a low opacity as well. It makes the whole pic/video blurry and covered in just the filter color and it’s difficult to adjust it to the original look because there’s no blending mode in the capcut program.

The best thing about capcut and why you should get it is the effects, The effects are so good! It helps me with my edits and the best effect i would recommend is the astral.

A big thing to note when saving videos is that if you’ve added an audio to the video, once you save there’s a sync issue. In the app, the audio is synced up perfectly to the video, all cues on point. But once it’s saved and I look at it, it’s always about a second off and then I have to adjust the audio and save it without the proper syncing so that when I watch the video on my camera roll, it will be synced. 
——————
Also I don’t like how if I’m listening to music on my phone, the app automatically pauses my music even if the video I’m editing had no audio. I like having the background noise going on and can’t have that with this app open so I always have to wait to be at my computer and use my headphones whenever I want to use capcut as a workaround to listen to music at the same time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-30T09:17:44-07:00

I got again recently like 1 month ish ago. and I was surprised to say it had gotten worse. I was shocked to see ""Capcut pro"" and tutorials, and templates; they are completely useless for other than maybe an idea or most likely an audio. You can't click one drop-down menu without seeing something about pro. And with the limited about of overlays it makes it hard to make an actual edit. I would ramble more but I don't want you to think this is a bad app. The layout is actually really good and it's very easy to navigate especially for a beginner.

Also, if we can apply, I have an option to be able to apply stabilization as well as noise reduction in one click for all clips, that would be great. Right now, noise reduction has to be applied for each clip, but it’s still easier than the image stabilization because you have to apply it with each clip, and it takes a few seconds for it to apply.

I had not had if for two days, and it was glitchy, it took forever to load, and etc. on day two (the day I deleted it) filters have disappeared, (and google is no help either one trying to figure out this maze of controls you really should have a tutorial) it made my apps go invisible, made my iPad shut down several times. And Would NEVER load. I tried importing four videos each one second, and it never loaded. It would always say “sorry try again” or “21% loaded” and would never load, also would shut my iPad down! Again! This app has several problems in my opinion. From what I’ve seen of this app it will be hard and IS hard to edit without Constant struggle. again I’m sure this app is great for some people but definitely not for me.

From making a quick little before/after video to a grwm video!! I love that you can pause videos in between takes and delete clips if you don’t like it. The only thing that kind of annoys me is that it only goes up to 3 minutes when you are making a video on camera. I wish you could go longer because that would really take the stress off of being like, “ahhh!! I only have 10 seconds left!!!” But I do really like how they have templates you can watch AND you can use the templates to create your own video!! Me and my cousins love watching funny videos on templates, and that is one thing I would NOT change. I really love the wide variety of filters you can choose from to make your video more interesting/funny. In conclusion, CapCut is great! I really enjoy it, but keep the 3 minute thing in mind.

I also wish that they add more filters, meaning that you don’t have to work super hard and make multiple edits just to add a cool filter. Also, I wish they had a few more audios that could fit with “trends” I guess. I make anime edits a lot so more of a variety of audios would be amazing. One more thing, I wish that the Keyframe would also be smoother, like you could adjust how fast and slow the key frame is without adjusting the speed of the actual video.

The first thing is, it takes up a whole ton of storage if you use it often. It took up over half of my storage on my device, which is a problem. It is also lacking good effects and transitions. There are a few good ones but some of the others are kind of disappointing and boring. Slowly I have noticed better transitions coming up, but some of the other ones need some work and improvement. The effects are also lacking my interest, with a few good ones. There are a few effects which cannot be adjusted, which is disappointing when they are too intense to your liking.

They added a lot of new and cool features and don’t get me wrong I love them but the new template feature is going to get out of hand soon. Many people on tiktok have threatened to sue CapCut for stealing edits with the template feature, and the CapCut community hasn’t stopped stealing yet. They go on tiktok and take the edit and make it into a template and they remove the watermark, I’m addressing this because a very popular editor made the ‘video game lover’ trend and it blew up all over social media, a few weeks later her exact edit was turned into a CapCut template and people were claiming the edit to be theirs. I know Lauren/ emo from whoville and she spends a lot of time on her edits for them to just get stolen.

It’s such a good easy app to use but with editing you don’t have to do anything else I mean you can make your own edit with it, but I kind of don’t use it because I kind of don’t know how to use it but for all those people who seen this app and I want to download it you should you really should OK just download it. It’s a good app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-30T13:22:02-07:00

I use this app and have primarily been editing on it for 2 years, but I don’t know if I’m lagging or something but, did you actually make the fade in effect a PRO FEATURE? I love this app and I just think such a simple effect isn’t worth that, I also think you should make a version of the ripple distortion effect for a loop text. And like the actual effect, don’t make it a pro feature as I feel that would be un fair, since it is just a different version of the original effect.. but I do love this app and it is all I use for editing, I just think it could improve a little bit, there is so many things I love but also can’t assure are the best things, so many things are missing from CapCut which could truly make it this best editing app for mobile, I had gone through multiple to find this app, I rate it a 5 stars but CapCut, what?!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T08:39:06-07:00

Right now I can’t edit anything on CapCut bc it says to lower your storage when it’s fine. I finally deleted some stuff then it said to blah blah do something and access it on setting so I look on setting and I tried to do all the changes it asked me for BUT there was no button of anything to change it so I tihnk that’s annoying because I always edit on there all the time and I can’t edit now I don’t know for how longer but if you see this I suggest you get the app because is AMAZING but if the developer sees it can you please change these problems I listed out 😊",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-06T11:53:58-07:00
10589000072,feebomeebo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1423706892,9.9.0,2,I’ve loved this app for years but it has betrayed me,"Two stars because I’ve been using this app as my primary editing app as I’ve been learning how to edit videos, but only two because today when I tried to export a video I spent a few days working on, the app told me I was using a pro feature and wouldn’t let me.

I was confused because I always make sure to not use any and check all my effects and such before I select them. The app told me that the glitch: by word text effect was a pro feature and I was shocked. I went back into my edit and found the effect but there was no pro icon next to it.

Really confused now, I looked up online to see if anyone was having the same issue and found forums months old of people saying they had also spent days working on edits and then got paywalled while trying to export. 

Seeing that this isn’t a sudden or new problem, it feels intentional that a popular effect like a glitching text effect is locked behind a secret paywall which people will only discover once they’ve put their hard work and effort into their edits.

I myself have been working for about 3 days on this edit which heavily used the glitching text effect. I’d have to go back and basically scrap the entire thing. 

I have nothing against people who buy and use pro features or the selling of pro features, but something like this should either be fixed ASAP if it’s a genuine mistake, or capcut has really gone down hill with such a scummy marketing strategy.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-15T10:58:22-07:00
