(We typically only wore scrubs.) I immediately logged into shein and bought 4 pairs of shoes, 4 pants and 5 tops for $189. Got the shipment Monday. (Expedited shipping.) I’ve gotten SO MANY COMPLIMENTS! In scrubs, I looked sloppy. In these clothes, I look polished. One coworker said I looked like I had walked straight out of a magazine. Even my confidence is up. I’m not a tiny person (size 12 pants and Large tops.) I did return a couple pants which were refunded promptly. Just not the right look for me. And it’s important to buy a size up in shoes if you’re in America because everything comes from China and the shoes run small. I will say though, I even went back later and purchased more clothes and jewelry.

Everything I’ve ordered thus far has been just as described on the site. The plus clothing are very fashionable and accurate to size. And I really love that there are colors and prints of many different choice in the plus sizes. The ordering process is simple and easy to maneuver through. If I had to say anything negative at all it would only be about the way several packages are stuffed in a box all together and that some of the wall decor and jewelry got bent/damaged during the delivery process. But even those things were minor and easy to repair. Overall I’m totally obsessed with this store and have and will continue to shop here for as long as I can afford to. P.S. The coupons are insane savings on already low affordable priced  products .

For example they do free trials for their clothing, this is when they show a bunch of clothing items and you can choose up to 3 each week and if you get approved they get mailed to your home for free and all you have to do is wright a detailed review with picture images of the clothing item to help better the company. They also have a daily check in where you earn points which helps for you to get a discount on clothing items. The app also provided many coupons making the overall total very nicely priced. The clothing here are cute and comfortable and all have reviews for you to view and see how well their clothing or other items are.

If I had to say anything negative about it it would be that if I don’t order right away sometimes items I really like go out of stock. I probably have close to a hundred swim suits from them now and atleast half my wardrobe is now things I’ve bought from SHEIN.  Check the reviews tho because some things are cheaply made but If they are cheaply made they are definitely cheaply priced so it’s not much of a loss.

I have two type of clothes in my closet, 1. Big clothes that meet my style but not my size; 2. Stuff that fits me, but is super girly and not really my style. But when I was searching through clothes apps, I found this one! I just got it today, but it looks perfect. All the stuff is my style AND my size! I do have to admit this though, some of this stuff is kind of inappropriate. There are REALLY short shorts and some really revealing halter tops.

I have contacted SheIn, and I gave them the confirmation order number, the tracking information, and then they close the conversation because there’s nothing else they could do! I tried contacting them three times and just gave up because they kept telling me the same thing where I’ll get a refund once they receive the package, even though I’m pretty sure it’s lost somewhere, but that’s not even my fault. I basically wasted about $60 of clothes I don’t even wear, and I’m going to probably just donate to Goodwill.

It has gained popularity by it being so called, ‘Fast Fashion’ which is cute and sometimes amazing material for the price! Usually the shirts are a little bad quality but the sweatshirts and sweatpants quality feels really similar to anything you find at other stores, for sometimes at least triple the price on SHEIN as you can get a sweatshirt for only 10 dollars in good material! I usually read most of the reviews on recommendations and size fits so if I may have to size down, there’s information I can use. Most of the people buying clothes in my size are usually minors, (like me) but some people happen to not understand good material or not, but I usually look at the top ratings in my language.

It’s now going on 3 weeks and I have yet to receive my purchases nor has the tracking info been updated in a week. I went thru the prompts to contact customer service and there is none. It redirects you to text your questions and concerns with a robot who just repeats the automated answers that are on the previous screen “commonly asked questions.” I followed the prompts that are to help you if your packages never arrive and there is no end solution. It takes you in circles. My assumption at this point is this: IF my packages don’t ever arrive, I’m out of the money already paid, there is no direct way to get a refund nor a department that you can speak with. And IF the package does arrive, I’m extremely concerned with the product quality only making this whole situation a domino affect of nothing short of poor customer service and bad business dealings.

Of course they don’t tell you until you have almost done placing your order and bombarded with coupons and promotions you cannot use. But what concerned me the most is when I add my address they not only removed my coupons but also RAISED the prices of most of the pieces that I was buying. So with the original price and almost $17 usd discount I was supposed to pay around $96. I end up paying around $126 with a $3 discount and realized after I paid and double checked my order that most prices were different than advertised before. Even the free express shipping offer was gone. I think the address must be asked before so you can get the real prizes of your country instead of changing them right after you add your payment method. Still kept the order to check if the quality still worth it but not very happy already.

They were delivered on different days and both the app and post office tracking say they were delivered but no one has seen them. And i was home at the time of both deliveries and was checking for them and I doubt they were stolen. They tell me to go through the post office to confirm that they are missing which I have and still no willingness to give a refund or re-ship my items. I like this store but I will be taking a break from shopping here and hopefully things will go a bit smoother the next time I decide to order from here again.

If I really need to get response from someone else, they are very helpful. Prices are amazing. Only complaint about the app is I have to actually click on the item from my wishlist and unLOVE/unClick the heart button to remove it compared to on the browser where I can easily remove from wishlist. It would be really convenient if the same thing applied on the app or even just to be able to select multiple items on my wishlist that I want to remove considering my wishlist tends to grow in number real quick.

There is a trick to buying these cheap items. You might find something you really like, but if it doesn’t have any purchases, DO NOT buy it! Majority of the time the not purchased items can be sketchy. Also be sure to read reviews. Reviews reveal the truth, and look to buy items with pictures in the review so you know what you are buying. But the worst thing is the shipping time. It does ship from China, so it is going to take a while. My swim suit took 4 months to get there, so be sure to check up on your order. If it comes in late you get to have a discount. (I get free jewelry!) also there is a shipping fee for everything. But overall, it’s a 4/5 for me. Decent clothing, cheap prices, some sketchy stuff, and a long shipping time. Thank for reading all the way :)

Free returns but keep in mind when you have points to use or coupons you will not get all the money of what the items cost. For example. If you buy a 20 dollar dress and use a coupon or points let say 5 dollars off you and you want to return a dress that cost you 20 dollars minus the 5 dollars off you will get 15 dollars back because they take your points or coupons back to them and they don't give it back to you.. Anyways at the same time you probably don't loose any money, but you loose your points and coupon that you have used in that purchase.

Many of the materials are thinner than they appear for example but you can’t really tell unless you’re wearing it. I love that for hot weather! The style and fit are usually pretty good. If you read the reviews it’s easier to tell how it will fit you. Perfect for people who don’t have a lot of money but don’t want to look it. Thinner fabrics means good for layering and creating looks that are fun and inexpensive. I wish I had SHEIN when I was in high school.

It’s also really affordable and not bad quality. Returning items that don’t fit or you don’t like is also easy and fast.

Reading the reviews and seeing pictures of the clothing on women with all body types helps me get a good idea of what the item will look like on me. That’s a huge bonus considering you don’t get a fitting room with online purchases! 

I used to work for a distributor for a high-end boutique chain, and some of the EXACT pieces we used to sell for $30, $40,$50 can be found on SHEIN for $18 or less. While it’s true that many of the items aren’t top quality, I’ve been extremely impressed by the vast majority of the things I’ve bought.

I’ve also purchased clothes and accessories as gifts and been very happy with all my purchases. The only thing I would suggest improving is the shipping and sizes. What I mean is that a lot of the sizes run small or large. For example I purchased school clothes for my daughter and most of them were fine but some tops and the shoes ran smaller than usual yet the bathing suit I purchased was way too big.

It was faster shipping than expected, so I had to put my package on hold so I can make it back to my house to receive my package (I was on vacation). If you are in a similar situation you should do a live chat on the SHEIN customer service, it might take a while though. DO NOT: submit a ticket, I have tried doing this and have gotten no response. So if you are having problems and need to modify your package delivery details, then do a live chat with the SHEIN customer service. Also make sure to DO YOUR MEASUREMENTS, DO NOT ESTIMATE this way you will get what fits you. I recommend reading all the reviews so you will get a better understanding of what you are buying.

From my experience it’s pretty great, obviously you get what you pay-for, it’s cheap clothing. Honestly I’ve never had a huge problem with shein all my clothes fit even some jewelry. Ok so for the clothing most of them are Polysphere based but actually feel pretty good I’ve washed all and have came out perfectly fine, I’ve worn them multiple times and no strings are lose.

Sizing was off. So do keep that in mind. It will happen! Wish the return process was simpler or I’d have made even more returns for wrong items sent or items that were too large even following the Shein measurements. Definitely read the reviews and those customers measurements and search for pics to see the fit. They could be your height and weight but carry their weight differently than you.

Another tging that i like about this app/store is that  if you want something there are different types to fit your style.

Fast fashion isn’t a label to describe poor quality clothing. Fast fashion is a system that fuels and profits from consumers in rich countries who are so far removed from the harmful effects that they 1) don’t realize they’re happening and/or 
2) develop apathy

Environmental 

The trendy styles that SHIEN quickly produces is just as quickly tossed, but because the material used is normally polyester + nylon the pieces will take more than 200 years to return to the soil. 

These materials also have been found to contain dangerous levels of lead and other chemicals. Those working in the facilities are exposed to these chemicals day in and day out. 

People

In Channel4’s documentary, some workers were forced into 17+ hour shifts. Other workers were given $20 daily wage but would be cut to $14 if they made mistakes on the garments. Some factories will take 2/3 of their daily pay for such mistakes. 

The truth is, women have been (myself included) tricked into thinking we need new clothes, we need them now, and we deserve them at a low cost. As it’s been revealed, the cost is not low. The cost is extremely high and shows up in worker abuse (mostly women), river pollution, plastic production, chemical poison, extremely high profit margins for little investment into the people and planet that is providing the products. That’s how we get $5 swim suits. Consumer culture isn’t worth it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-12T10:16:35-07:00
