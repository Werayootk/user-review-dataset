I have been now stuck 3 times over 6 months with their customer service: each time it took weeks (literally weeks!) to solve the same basic source of funds issue and whilst you wait for someone to answer you are completely stuck and have no way to raise your concern as your help function is stuck in “search for an available agent” mode for weeks at the time. Revolut should definitely loose their license.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-04T00:05:27-07:00

A big fan of this app and service. Thanks to all the team.
Wondering though, it would be really nice to be able to adjust a volt that I have dedicated to specific payment, as a source to a scheduled payment. This way organizing repayments would be be even more clean and smart. What you guys say about it?
