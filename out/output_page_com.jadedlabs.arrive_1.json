Who would like to track their purchase from order inception to good delivered? This is where I have found Shop to be lacking.  The order appears in the account linked to you quickly but There is little useful information beyond what you would get in an email confirmation from the store.  From there I‚Äôve found the app to be somewhat pointless.  Most recent example would be an order placed weeks ago.  Once the order showed shipped it just spent days on the location map in the state from which it was sent.  I repeatedly checked on status but it appeared as no movement.  I checked this morning and it moved from one city in the originating state to another city in that state.  Early this afternoon it just showed up in the mail.  I then got a notice hours later after delivery from the app indicating that it was out for delivery.  Then later in the day, hours after it delivered got another notice that it was just delivered. \n\nCan‚Äôt really say that I see the purpose or the benefit of the app.  The USPS service app gave far better updates and provided greater accuracy.  \n\nOther orders showing up in Shop have the same issue so can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm terribly enthusiastic about it.

As long as you have a gmail account that you use to make your purchases, Arrive will automatically sync the information into your account. And if you have a lot of completed deliveries piled up in your ‚Äúmain folder‚Äù, they have an archive that you can store them in for future reviews.

This one does a better job and depending on which carrier you choose (e.g. you could track via USPS or China Post EMS for some packages), it may show you either Chinese or English text. A few suggestions for improvement are: make deliveries editable so you can change the carrier if you make a mistake (right now, I think you‚Äôd have to create another listing instead), improve the updates (refreshing the statuses doesn‚Äôt always do anything, I‚Äôve had packages arrive but not show that even after refreshing), please add the SpeedPAK carrier (I‚Äôve had several packages sent through this carrier when ordering from eBay), and make a view mode where there are no maps, so that you just see package locations (you‚Äôd see more at once that way).

And it happens across package delivery services. I‚Äôve started to use the actual package companies‚Äô trackers rather than clicking my way there via the Shop app. \n\nA useful feature would be to allow users to modify packages as much as we used to be able to. For example, I place an order with Store X, who tends to use ShipStation. Once the package is shipped I have two entries in my package list- one from Store X and one from ShipStation. If I want to declutter my list I have to either delete the entry from Store X or from ShipStation. I cannot edit the original Store X item with the tracking information, which would be the easiest way for the user to eliminate duplicate entries. If I delete the Store X entry I no longer have that information saved in my history. I can modify the ShipStation entry with additional information about who sent the package, but it‚Äôs limited to naming. It does not pull the original order information from Store X into the ShipStation entry. \n\nSo, at this point, between not showing the most up to date tracking information and not being able to modify (or merge) packages, this app is only a 3 star app. Fix those issues and it would be a 5 star app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-31T10:44:11-07:00"},{"id":"10747387005","userName":"Dyl93h","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1251652002","version":"2.137.0","score":3,"title":"It‚Äôs okay.","text":"While the app is enjoyable and having everything you need under one app makes is easier to track packages, in the last few months there has been issues with package tracking.

Every single time I am tracking a package, I always have to visit the actual carrier tracking website to find out where my package is...  Shop usually doesn‚Äôt update for several hours!  Very unreliable and frustrating, especially when you‚Äôre waiting for an important delivery & it ends up sitting outside because you had no idea it already arrived.

It has a nice feature (if the company provides it) it shows a map & has a dot where your package is & shows a pretty good prediction of when your package will arrive! Has a lil nice notification of updates. Only thing is tho not many companies don‚Äôt provide much detail so the app doesn‚Äôt always show the map or the package details so it just says what company it‚Äôs coming from & is it‚Äôs shipped or still being processed & the order tracking number but not a picture/name of your purchase & details of exactly where your package is or a map of it. So it‚Äôs not the app‚Äôs fault but rather how much effort your provider puts in their details.

My favorite feature is the GPS map for sure, this is convenient in estimating visually when you will receive the package for the day. Cons: not all of the product names show up with the listed shipment. So if you are like me and your waiting for several packages to arrive, you may have to click on the shipment and visit the site to view which tracking number aligns with which product. I‚Äôm assuming the vendor has something to do with that, but it would be cool if all listed shipments had pictures of the items purchased.

You also cannot delete any tracking emails because it scans your email inbox for tracking numbers causing your inbox to become stuffed and cluttered with old tracking information.

Each time I jump on board and try to trace all of my outstanding shipments to see if the app has improved. The concept is good, but the actual tracking is strange. It tracks the packages accurately in time, but not location. It will show my packages all over the country and even out for delivery in a random location. The item will actually arrive at my doorstep as indicated, but their mapping shows the location across the state or even across the country from where it actually is. I got fooled the first couple of times and contacted the shipper, but then realized it was only the app screwing up location tracking. Weird bug that hasn‚Äôt been fixed over the past couple of years so I guess it doesn‚Äôt bother anyone but me, lol. Three stars because it actually tells me when my package is arriving and notifies me when it does. Only three because I don‚Äôt like the initial moment of panic I get when it tells me someone three hundred miles away is about to get my kid‚Äôs Christmas present.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-10T10:37:45-07:00"},{"id":"8644298916","userName":"lillynnpie","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104364842","version":"2.54.0","score":5,"title":"Never Miss a Delivery Again","text":"I downloaded this app a few years ago when it went by a different name. I never would remember to check my email notifications for items I had ordered regularly but never really had an issue. That was until an order of mine either wasn‚Äôt delivered or was stolen, I will never know. I was devastated as I was really looking forward to receiving that package. It was at that time I decided to look in to delivery notification options and found this app. \n\nIt‚Äôs easy enough to install and link to your emails. If you have a single email that you use for shopping and junk then this is perfect. It searches you emails for order confirmation emails and tracking emails and updates you on delivery status of each package from the carrier. You can also go directly to the carrier‚Äôs website with your tracking information from the app. \n\nIf you don‚Äôt want the app to scan your email you can use the manual entry feature as well. \n\nMy only issue is sometimes the tracking emails and confirmation emails do not sync so I‚Äôll have 2 records for the same order. \n\nBut other than that I can track all my packages easily in one place and I have never missed an order. \n\nI was even able to catch a carrier in a lie because I checked the door less than a minute after they said they had delivered the package and it wasn‚Äôt there, all because I had this app. \n\nTL;DR - Great app to use if you have multiple deliveries you want to track. Easy to use and everything is all in one place.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-06T15:12:20-07:00"},{"id":"3822699622","userName":"halfdevilchick333","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id123280274","version":"1.2.9","score":5,"title":"Good, BUT needs more user control","text":"I signed in with my google account and so far it has worked how it is supposed to, super easy to have all the tracking numbers in one place!

It serves that purpose very well, but the Shop Cash concept and the shopping flow in general is seriously lacking.

This is a bad experience since shipping costs can be a determining factor in whether you purchase something. There is also a huge disconnect between what shops are/aren‚Äôt accepting Shop Cash and this changes very frequently (don‚Äôt keep an item in your bag for too long as the deal may disappear in the next hour with no warning).
