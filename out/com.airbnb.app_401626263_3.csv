I would like to preface this that Thailand is 90+ degrees and having a air conditioner is vital. When we showed up only one of the two barely worked and after a week it started leaking creating huge water damage all along the walls and on the floor. We had to use pots to catch the water. On top of that the seal on the toilet is rotted causing puddles of runoff water to puddle in the bathroom. And the washing machine is broken. It won’t drain either so there’s just a pool of murky washing machine water stuck in in there. We contacted the host MANY times and after they responding with ‘hi’ every once and a while they just decided to ghost us. After more looking around I found mold which probably explains why I’ve been feeling so sick this entire trip. 
Airbnb wants us to move places (on my and my roomies dime of course.) but 
my roommate and I can’t afford to apartment hop. Especially when the refund deal is so awful. Their final offer is 30% off the first day. and a refund on the cleaning fee. 

So basically we save what? 30$ dollars? 
Thanks Airbnb. You really saved the day! (Please note the sarcasm). 
On top of that they only want to refund the remaining days which would make sense if they would contact us quickly. Instead they take days to respond and than get annoyed when we need quick resolutions as both me and my roommate are sick from the growing mold.

We were in a downstairs unit, and the owners of the upstairs unit left their dog alone by itself, barking for over two hours. There was a shared entryway with these owners, and we didn’t want to risk conflict with them by reporting them. However, after two hours, we contacted the host and told them what was going on and asked if we could have a refund so that we could find alternate accommodations. The host never acknowledged our request. We waited an hour, then booked an alternate place and left. We didn’t spend any nights in the place. We contacted Airbnb support for a refund, who was nice, saying that the host never acknowledged our message, and that he’s glad we went to a hotel. However, then he messaged us later saying that they can’t do anything about it because the host doesn’t want to refund us. By the way, the unit was cold, grimy, and didn’t look like the pictures. The hotel was only about a half mile away, was clean, had a pool and hot tub, and was cheaper than the Airbnb. I’m done with Airbnb after this experience. They did nothing to help with the situation, so I’m not sure why I would give them any more of my business.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-21T08:10:23-07:00

It would also be nice if instead of the category Fun, you could specify what actually you were looking for like a pool or pool table and not have a bunch of listing show up with a community playground.  
Beach house is the only really useful category at the moment for people looking for a normal vacation or short term rental for travel.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-20T08:18:41-07:00

All functionality for completion of payment requests does not work at all. When logged in for an current reservation a request was routed to my email prompting me to log in via browser through FB and requiring Meta secondary verification to complete. No record of this payment is visible in the app. 

For all of the fees paid to ensure airbnbs support I had to complain 5x about a false listing to get ANY response. It is still unresolved. Support wait times quoted are entirely fictitious.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-20T01:36:22-07:00

-There are lots of commercial rental properties that rent on ABnB. The app still describes all listings as “you’ll be staying in someone’s home….” Which is definitely not true. 

-The prices used to be good enough to book an Airbnb over a hotel 100% of the time. Now it’s more like 50/50.

-I’m finding that most listings charge a (usually significant) cleaning fee -AND- ask you to do the dishes, take out the trash, etc.

I still book through Air BnB periodically and the app experience itself is pretty trouble free, but the whole experience has become less pleasant over time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-19T14:48:27-07:00

Dear Airbnb, I don’t need you to remove my future guests without prior notice, especially at a time like this. Give me the superhost relief fund I’m qualified for. I’ve been a superhost for almost 5 years straight and made you thousands of dollars. Your customer service agents talked to me like I was an annoyance to them when I asked. I’ve been bleeding money every month for the last two months and for months to come. I can’t pay for mortgage in full. Is this how you treat your superhosts? Absolutely ridiculous.

Update: they’ve really outdone themselves with their crappy customer service. They raised service fees for both hosts and guests. They’ve lowered the quality of service on both ends. They’re really trying to run their business to the ground.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-19T11:19:50-07:00
