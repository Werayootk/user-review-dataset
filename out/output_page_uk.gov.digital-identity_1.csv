10004759967,Comments re British ID issues,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id660620594,1.14.0,1,"Inadequate, unhelpful, and frustrating","I am an ex pat, trying to sign onto the government gateway. The multi factor identification requires two of three forms of ID; a current UK, drivers license, a current, UK, passport, or current credit information. As stated, I’ve lived in the US for sometime, and as a result, have no UK drivers license and no UK credit to be found. As a result, I can’t be verified this way. A second option was biometric facial, scanning from my passport. After three attempts this failed as well. On top of all that I’m trying to get help through the online chat service with HM revenue and customs. There was a problem with a Service. I have no way to sign into the gateway. And no help in resolving the problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1629050566&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-06T03:41:05-07:00
