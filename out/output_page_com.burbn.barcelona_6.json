No clear guidelines on how to get your post in front of people. Hash tags dont work like twitter & no categories like IG. Worst of all you cant delete your account. Meta is desperate to claim they have many accounts by not letting people delete it unless they delete instagram. Dont bother install it. Pure waste of time.

The content AI/ algorithm seems very weird and the content given is unlike what my Instagram home page is like at all. Furthermore, for those who have two accounts (one personal and one public etc.) there is no way to switch between them seamlessly like in Instagram. I would really like that to happen.

They added an edit button for a few minutes to where you can edit your post which is cool. I feel you guys should keep it unique though.

And the fact that you can’t hide the constant pushing of Threads in IG is also a turnoff.  The whole premise of Threads was a less toxic Twitter, I call that unequivocally false.  Just the same echo chambers of vitriolic clowns spewing the same crazy rhetoric.
