I have played it for almost as long as it has existed and I really loved the early versions. The newest version, introducing the fungle I thought was really good and I like the little mushrooms that blow up and produce concealing smoke. One thing I have figured out through experience is that now you can‚Äôt text freely unless you have a major account which I don‚Äôt know how to get, I kind of understand that the developers don‚Äôt want people cursing, etc. in the chat, but it makes it almost impossible to defend yourself in meetings except by literally just saying that you didn‚Äôt do ‚Äúit‚Äù. You can‚Äôt give any irregular context and your accusations are limited to so-and-so killed so-and-so and you should vote him out you can‚Äôt give ANY context to the point of how he did it if you actually saw him do it or if he did anything that is actually considered suspicious. In short I actually still enjoy playing this sometimes but just please bring back the free chat and I would like this game a hundred times more than I do now. In other words I just think gameplay has deteriorated over time, only in the chat though, everything else I personally think is fine. So yeah in the end just that please.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T16:42:05-07:00

11060378089,gamer with 200000 iq,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1243767369,2024.3.5,3,It used to be fun- but could definitely be a lot better,"Among us used to be a such a great game, even when it wasn‚Äôt SUPER POPULAR AFTER 2020, but all of the updates to where almost everyone can vent, all of the different roles, etc. just made it boring. Now I just don‚Äôt like among us anymore.

 Honestly, I kinda lost interest during the time we were waiting for the Airship. It took so long and the map wasn‚Äôt exactly as good as we thought it would be, although we did have really high hopes for it BECAUSE it was taking so long. 

There is a new battle pass, and that makes it way too competitive and if I‚Äôm busy how am I supposed to even get anything from the season/battle pass? The new roles are a little excessive, however I enjoy the fact that you can disable most of them. 

A few last things- I would actually recommend adding a casual game mode and/or hide and seek. You could also just make it a setting where you can disable crewmates, or imposters. When all imposters are disabled, you can all be crewmates, have tasks on or off, and explore the map with friends. All crewmates disabled would be a battle against all imposters without emergency meetings, and everyone spawns spread out across the map. And finally, the host should be allowed to chose exactly which tasks each and every player should receive, as well as the default setting we already have.

         With all of this, I think I would definitely choose to play Among Us again, and maybe get my friends into it too! Thank you for your time.

Firstly, you cannot log in without Apple ID. Creating an issue for the younger players to play without Safechat which basically ruins the gameplay? This cannot be overlooked. It is most of the reason players are abandoning the game for more hot games like Betrayal.io or Roblox to make profits off it.

But about 7-12 weeks ago it started to not load, when ever I open the app it always says ‚Äúit sure is taking a while‚Äù and then it has 2 options 1: keep waiting 2:play offline.  Whenever I press ‚Äúkeep waiting‚Äù it just keeps and keeps on loading and asking the same question again and again and it never loads the game. When I press play offline there aren‚Äôt any servers to play in, and if I create a server no one plays offline so no one can join. So now it‚Äôs ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE  to play among us! Tysm for reading!

I literally cannot express how lost I was before I found this game. It‚Äôs allowed me to make friends and unwind after a hard day of work.
Idk where I would be without Among Us!, it‚Äôs made me a person I‚Äôm proud to be.

Oh and I found my best friend on this game. I‚Äôm going to meet him for the first time at Arby‚Äôs tomorrow!! Wish me luck üòäüòä!!!
