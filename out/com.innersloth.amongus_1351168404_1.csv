Firstly I like how you can just go around as a crew mate and not get killed immediately because you want to keep a low profile of who is the imposter unlike other games I really enjoy how you make it a mystery game! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

There are two tiny things I do suggest though. Firstly, I don‚Äôt really care that you made the chat you have to choose because I didn‚Äôt even notice until someone told me because I don‚Äôt use the chat (house rules). But the NAMES‚Ä¶ I think you should just like deny inappropriate names or tag them out like Roblox I‚Äôm not comparing you but I want to input a name say for example ‚Äúqueen‚Äù and I can‚Äôt because you have to randomize it I really think you should allow people to express themselves through names. The second thing is I read another review and I totally agree with them 100 percent just not in the way they phrased it. They said it was a GOOD thing this game was really addictive but that can get tricky. Like if I‚Äôm in the middle of a match and it‚Äôs dinner time or I have to do a chore that takes literally two seconds, I refuse because I don‚Äôt want to do It I want to keep playing. It‚Äôs good that you made the app like that but its REALLY interfering with my role around the house so maybe you could make it slightly less addicting although I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs possible.

Overall, this is a good game one of the best games I‚Äôve played!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-22T08:20:42-07:00

I love the detail added to the hide and seek mode of the game with the meeting button broken.  That‚Äôs one of my favorite details because you can‚Äôt call the meetings!  Every time there‚Äôs a meeting, I get voted out!  For example: once, I did scan in front of EVERY player in the game I was playing with!  But when the other gamer who wasn‚Äôt with us the whole time reported the body he said that I was the imposter!  Everyone said that I did scan and the gamer said that because I did scan it was me!  I‚Äôm sorry, but has that person lost their mind?!  Anyway, they all voted me out even though they saw me do scan and then the rest of the crew said that he was safe because he voted me out and I wasn‚Äôt the imposter!  That‚Äôs the reason why I don‚Äôt like the meetings!  The second detail I love was how the creators made the seeker so cool and creepy!  I love that they added how many crew members were alive and dead!  I also love the bar for how close the imposter is!  That was a really big help for me!  I was getting a little kinda bored of the classic among us so i‚Äôm very happy and thrilled that they added hide and seek to the game!  The next game I want them to add is an all new shift and seek game so when is crew mates are trying to play shift and seek in classic mode, every one will actually play by the rules of shift and seek!

This game is tremendously entertaining but, with time this game gradually gets boring. It eventually went to me playing this game everyday to never playing this game in the duration of months. I had such an amazing time playing this game. After months of not playing this game I came back, but now the enjoyment of playing this game has declined as a result of this games updates. One of my critiques for this game is the limitations of speech. I do understand that without the limitations of speech people could get foul things said to them, but when you‚Äôre not allowed to explain yourself why your not the Imposter, that takes away the point of the game; Prove yourself trustworthy and deceive the Crewmates or catch the Imposter without being suspected. In my opinion, the graphics aren‚Äôt the most flattering, I prefer the the previous version but yet again, that‚Äôs just a personal preference. The fact that you can‚Äôt change your name in the game is also just a minor change that I miss. Yes they removed the feature of changing your name because people were abusing that power, but there are other solutions that would make everyone happy, for example: censoring the name, instead of just completely taking the ability to change your name away. Other then these minor issues, the game is still enjoyable, I still would recommend people to play this game just to kill downtime.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-17T16:13:48-07:00

And also you can kick and\or ban but why can‚Äôt we ban or kick in-game you can say bad words and things there too. But also I want to play with more then 10 players but I have to get a mod to do that and that messes up the whole game! Me and my friend played this game 2 days ago and we found a game with 245 people in it! I think we should be able to do that without a mod. And I think we should have a friend request button because some people say ‚ÄúI would love to play with you again let‚Äôs swap numbers!‚Äù Being a child I obviously said no but I did want to play with them again witch was unfair because I really liked them! Also it disconnects so easily so if my dad texts I go over check it maybe respond after 30 seconds go back and I‚Äôve disconnected! I think there should be unlimited emergency meetings just saying. And another thing I want to open the doors like in the polus in the skeld.

I think the imposter should be available to shoot someone from a distance that would be cool. I hope the game will add some thing for a ghost like it‚Äôs not fun to be a ghost it would be nice for something new‚Ä¶ like a impostor ghost like he can Haunt people and take their bodies. But...you can only do it once. There should be some new game modes like hide and seek or a solo mode. I know some one made a solo mode but it‚Äôs a different game and you can‚Äôt get it on Mobile so that would be fun. I love your game thanks. Few mouths later. NEW ROLES? YES! Cosicubes? Cool. Removeing app purchases. EXTREMELY STUPID. I Spent some of my money on this game and they REMOVE IT? Hamster and dog and clothing are gone from me. And I have to spend MORE MONEY TO GET IT BACK?! :( WHY? JUST WHY? AND YOU DONT REFUND IT STILL? Are you kidding. but still the update is cool. New roles I love it. Maybe some more in the future. Please give the app purchases back this made me anxious. I have a 3 star approval of this game cuz of this. But it‚Äôs still 4 stars because of the game kinda balanced it out. ( pets in cosmicubes) lol. Plz give stuff back. Please. And a was gonna say something about disconnecting whenever someone leaves but you fixed that.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn‚Äôt get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

   It‚Äôs a great game, really! And what I‚Äôm about to say may be because you earn money because of it.. but I‚Äôm just a kid so I don‚Äôt really get this stuff. But Among us used to be the type of game that you could be impostor or crewmate, and impostor: you could kill people, sabotage, and try not to get exposed! But watch out! People could be on the cameras in security making sure there‚Äôs no funny business! Crewmate: escape the impostor and try not to get killed! Try not to get accused for being impostor and stay low, and do your tasks! If the impostor gets you than you become a ghost!- anyway I think this is a great game especially with avatar creator!

7101466064,Alaskagirlem,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id205203237,2021.3.5,5,"Great game, can always be better","Hi, so I‚Äôve been reading reviews on this game and one thing I have seen come up many times is a microphone added for players to chat with one another. Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don‚Äôt have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast. Definitely recommend.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-14T03:20:07-07:00
6608344864,unknownpersonüò∂,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id858332212,2020.10.22,4,Good game!,"Overall ‚ÄòAmong Us‚Äô is a really good and addictive game. It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much! I just hope that you take these opinions into mind. üíô

All you can say to defend yourself is lies or no. Also with the update you can‚Äôt find what you want to say, because by the time you do everyone has voted , very few seconds left or they don‚Äôt believe you because you took to long. I get that you were just trying to help the situation because some people where say I love you and stuff like that. THIS IS A GAME PEOPLE CHILDREN PLAY THIS! These kind of things have ruined so many games for me and others. Are we not going to talk about the glitches in the game like one time people could walk outside the ship and one the wall. Also I don‚Äôt know how the game choose to be imposter but that needs to change I played the game once for 1 hour and I was never the imposter once! It‚Äôs not fair because people can be imposter 3 times in a row! You need to change how long the kill cool down is because a person can make it take 45 seconds long in my opinion that is too long the same goes for the discussion and voting time. I also have a suggestion maybe you can make a sheriff to find out who the imposter is, and if the sheriff dies then a person can get the weapon or something and kill the impostor. I think that the imposter should be able to do fake tasks but when they do that the crew mates get an alert something.

It‚Äôs just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing since. Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot.

Being the imposter is probably my favorite part of the game and not getting caught. Being a cremate is cool also and helping the team. But I do know something‚Äôs need too be changed. For example I played a lot of games with people and the most horrible things I‚Äôve seen is kids cussing at each other or gain up and bullying each other. You can still cuss if you write it a certain way just saying or when people won‚Äôt play the game right and gain up on cremates and help the imposter. Also the game will sometimes make it too where I can‚Äôt type in group discussion too others about who I think the imposter is or I will start a game and be stuck and can‚Äôt move and the only way is going to settings and pushing the finger movement option then put it back to control pad. Another thing that bothers me is when people want hack the game so they can win. For example I was playing a game and report the kill and all sudden I was dead, when no one killed me. That‚Äôs called sabotage the whole game by hacking it. Also people get bored play the same map. Should update the maps once a month. That‚Äôs why people end up deleting the game because it gets boring play same map over and over.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can‚Äôt really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

Can you also make it to where you can keep passed games you made. Like say you hosted a game and you like the people in the game, can you make it to where you can have like a place where all your passed games where at and keep it there. Can you also maybe make it where you can favorite lobby. Like there can be a button like a heart or something and you can go to like a tab and go to your favorite lobby‚Äôs. Do you also think you can it where when you die you can a have an overview of the whole map. But only when you die so it‚Äôs fair.

But I am, Among Us is a good game and the people who play the game are very interesting. And could I forget the hackers and modders who bring out the best in this game‚Äôs potential. But unfortunately I do have a detailed list of complaints, but please listen they might be worth changing...
1: THE ???: So when playing Among us a well known glitch is a player with a dark green skin but a little lighter and it‚Äôs name is just three question marks. It doesn‚Äôt bother me but it creeps me out.
2: Oh you want to play a game well NO: so this will always happen when I play Among Us, when I go into a game I‚Äôm in the drop ship right? But as soon as the game starts, even before the role choosing I am suddenly ejected (logged out) of the game right back to my screen where all the games and apps are!? üò±üò±üò±. So please find this glitch and wipe it out. ALSO when that happens thanks to your new thing I have to wait a certain amount of time before playing again because I ‚Äúdisconnected to early.‚Äù Also that time can be really LONG.
So that is really it but I do have a few things to say...

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn‚Äôt really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwUüíû).

I LOVE this game, considering how hard it is to find a murder mystery game that is fun, challenging, and overall a enjoyable game. And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it‚Äôs free on mobile, is so nice, and it‚Äôs one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I‚Äôm excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!

But.....,"So this is a great game! and if your not playing it, what are you doing go ahead and download! But anyway this game is super good I have a lot of fun playing it and had a really good first impression but people do get quite annoying and toxic. For example some people who are on your team as imposter will see you kill someone and then report the body and say (your name/ color) DID IT! And it‚Äôs really annoying. Another thing is sometimes bodies that are next to a door that‚Äôs closed, you can‚Äôt see the body not that big of a deal but I‚Äôve gotten voted of bc of it one time, idk if this was a glitch but I think the guy was modding or something but I was in admin on the skeld and the report button popped up but there wasn‚Äôt a body another guy was in there as well and even said there wasn‚Äôt a body on his screen either idk if it was a bug or a modder but I got voted off for it and it frustrated me quite a bit other bugs as well but there not really a big deal because there only there for a min or 2 and the game still operates as it should... plus teaming is a big issue but there‚Äôs not really anything you can do about that.
other than these things amazing game definitely recommend. If your wondering the community is ok but certain lobby‚Äôs can be really toxic so just leave them and find a different one.

The app developers have recently taken away free chat and in order to communicate to other players in game , you have to use this weird side bar that has pre made sentences and phrases which is just beyond me . This makes it so much harder to communicate to other players what‚Äôs going on and I‚Äôve actually started playing a lot less now because of this , it‚Äôs just not that fun anymore not being able to say what I need to say and it takes forever to find the phrases I need to say . I know some people can be aggressive or inappropriate but it‚Äôs not fair to stifle everybody else in game because of those players . Another big problem I have in the game is that I can‚Äôt add any other player as a friend so when someone has to leave and I‚Äôve gotten close with them after so many games it‚Äôs disappointing to see them go and know there‚Äôs no way of playing with them again .

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it‚Äôs really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say ‚Äú(A) was running away from the body.‚Äù Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don‚Äôt have options to say it, but when it does happen you can‚Äôt do anything about it.

I see a lot of problems with this, first of all when someone thinks that you are suspicious, you have to type some kind of defense, but in the new update, you have to find word by word all perfect until you read what you have typed and then no one will understand you. Second of all, in that wheel of words, you take so long to find what you have to say, and by the end when you finally picked all of the words you want to send, everyone has already had their votes on you, because you were not saying anything witch made you look suspicious and then the whole crew already voted you out. Third of all this game is mostly bouncing the suspicious ball around in other players hands and then trying to throw it away, but if you have nothing to say because it took you so long to do pick words, this just made the imposters job way easier so all the imposter has to do is say a crewmates name and the crewmates can not say a reason that they are not suspicious, I mean yes, you can say lies but that is barley anything the imposter can say lies back and they will never stop until the imposters clearly win, so this game now is just if you are an imposter, I t is an insta-win for you.

What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

For example: I start up free play and see an option saying ‚Äúwould you like to turn on intelligent mode?‚Äù I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.

EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it‚Äôs happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature. Once again, I will be awaiting your response.

Love ur games (particularly this one) So this game is awesome!!! I play it by myself and with my friends. I love all the ships and all the tasks too! I love skeld and airship the most!!! :) So here are my questions: People have men talking about ‚Äúthe king of polus‚Äù and its viral. His name is murr3y and he lives in the big hole in polus. So‚Ä¶is he real? Can we see him somehow? And another one called molten. He lives in the lava pool, and to summon him you need to lower the temrature in the lava pool. So, is he real too? Or just fanfiction? There‚Äôs one called killer, a supreme impostor, and he‚Äôs brown and can take a different form‚Ä¶.there are many ways you can summon him especially in polus‚Ä¶.is that true? People are also saying monsters liv on polus and its a mysterious planet. There‚Äôs one monster called patient zero. The first impostor. Is he real? There‚Äôs one in the airship, named Ellie. I was watching a vid and it said some impostors named Eric lork and sire sorol summoned her. Is she real? I know its really weird, but i would actually like to see these creatures. Oh, and theres one called s4boteur. Another supreme impostor. Is he real? I would love seeing all os them and my friends would too. Please tell me if they‚Äôre real or not.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds but, there are people swearing in the chat, and especially when there is a hacker at the moment.

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family. EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

Other than that when you type in the chat you have options on what you gave us but in my opinion it's not that specific to me and it's hard to work with we kinda sound like robots but I completely understand why you did that for people that sexualize the game that has nothing to do with it or the cursing because it has nothing to do with among us it's either one person is being disrespectful and making a scene but im not that worried about that it's mostly the sexual things people say it's a lot more dangerous because younger kids play this game and I don't want them seeing that for example horny girl, horny boy, looking for a bf/gf and some people like to insert there numbers, social media's which can possibly cause them to get things sent to them that are very inappropriate but literally the truth is none should be reading, seeing, or even doing inappropriate things no matter how old you are unless it's you know what..so also the name changing I get it I really do but I wish there was a way to scan the name and it can tell if the name is appropriate then randomizing it but it isn't that important but I completely understand.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added.

When I try to make a new account it doesn‚Äôt let me choose a name, and I have a genius name idea üí°. I do like that you can‚Äôt really cuss and swear, because people should not swear on games. I think this because children of any age can be on this game even three, or  four year olds. Most people change there age. And this update for talking has good qualities like stops child predators from targeting, or puts people who cuss in there place. This also makes this game more kid friendly. This game is more likely to be approved by parents. But maybe you could give more freedom have a child mode and an adult mode. Maybe you could have a parent monitoring thing where parents could monitor what there kids are doing and saying. Please consider some of my changes.

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors. I really hope they don‚Äôt just divert all their assets into the planned sequel because I don‚Äôt believe the sequel will be as much of a success as it could be if any players are left disappointed in this game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-07T19:12:14-07:00

You can run your little character around in 4 different maps. Mira HQ. polus, the skeld, and airship. And a 5th map is coming soon. Its a good time killer game and can be very addictive. You can chat, and talk with crewmates (bad words can be censored with a setting, but usually the lobbies are fine) and impostors. You can to tasks as the crew such as fixing wires, taking out the garbage, or even ordering from a vending machine. As you and your fellow crew try to find the imposters (there can be up to 3!) lurking around. As an imposter, you and (maybe) your fellow imposters, can run around and kill the crew! Sabotage the ship then run and try to fix it! Got caught killing? Try saying it wasnt you and it was the crew to throw off suspicion. yes, you can make manual texts and names, but it requires a login. Without one, you receive a randomized name and only able to use quick chat (saying ‚ÄúReactor‚Äù through the location menu and not being able to type ‚Äúit was in reactor‚Äù).

What is that?? I will be playing and then it randomly disconnects me from the game i'm playing. Please do something about that. Its super annoying. Then we have the not being able to join a game for another 5 to 10 minutes. That‚Äôs really annoying because i just wanna play the dang game. Please remove that. i intentionally leave because i don't wanna play in that sever anymore. THEN, there are the tinder daters. Like if you wanna date someone, then go on a dating app, not a game where little children play. Its so inappropriate. I once was in a sever and some disgusting person was asking someone if they wanted to have s*x. I know you can‚Äôt do anything about it but it has to stop. And in my opinion, y‚Äôall should add a buddy feature to the game because i wanna play with the sweetest people that i meet on the game. But then i disconnect and i lose them. Then y'all updated the game. Whats with the shapes on the wires? The whole update in my opinion is just pointless and stupid.

I‚Äôm not saying you should get rid of it. I‚Äôm just wondering if there could be an option to turn it off? Because I have a strategy where I pretend to be new to among us and it can‚Äôt work now. Also at the end of an among us game we used to be able to say GG and now we can‚Äôt even give valid points on why we think it‚Äôs green. I can see why you added it. It must be easier for Nintendo. Also it has color blind support. The problem it we are not all going to notice the names and there is stuff we can‚Äôt do now. Like it‚Äôs custom to say ‚ÄúSus‚Äù instead of suspicious and ‚ÄúGG‚Äù at the end of a game. An option to turn it off would be helpful and also if you are worried about less color blind support you would be wrong. Because you could make it so when we said ‚Äúblue Sus‚Äù it turns into ‚Äúguppy Sus‚Äù aka the name of the blue player. There could be an option to make it so you see the words like that if your color blind an you can turn it off if you are not. I personally think it‚Äôs SO HARD to use quick chat and it‚Äôs more annoying then useful. 

Now, to end on a high note, to any new players, THIS GAME IS SO FUN YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Edit: And I love the airship.
