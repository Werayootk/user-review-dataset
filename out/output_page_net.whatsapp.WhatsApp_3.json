I am in a 25 person family group chat (which of course I can‚Äôt leave because it will tell everyone) and it‚Äôs pretty constantly going, so I ‚Äúmute‚Äù the chat and it doesn‚Äôt pop up notifications, but as soon as I open the app I see it at the top of my chat list with a little blue circle of 1,000,000 new messages. I select ‚Äúarchive‚Äù and it HALLELUJAH goes away, but THEN (two minutes later) someone sends another message and it pops to the top again... PLEEEEEEEEASE, pretty please with a cherry on top, make a way for me to mute and archive chats that I can control and decide when I want to start seeing them at the top of my chats list again... Please. It would be a life saver.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-10-17T12:51:51-07:00"}]
