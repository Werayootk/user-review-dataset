I also love how they make updates currently! to end this long review, I just wanna say that subway surfers is the best. thanks for reading this and have an amazing day/night! bye!!<3333",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-02T14:47:44-07:00

I downloaded it, started playing it, and I have to admit, it might be my new favorite game. I have only one suggestion to make it BETTER, if that’s even possible!!’😜 So heat me out. When you play the game, it opens up a tab thingy that asks for your age. I put it in and continued. As soon as I opened the tutorial, it made me play as Charlie. Since I’m a girl, I naturally wanted to play as a girl character, right? So I went over to the character panel and tried to switch around my character. I quickly realized that you either have to pay 30,000 coins, which is extremely hard to get, or collect three beanies in mystery boxes. I opened TEN since then and none of them had a beanie! I was like, what?! So my suggestion is that after you put in your age, you put in your gender as well. Sorry for the long story, and please read this!

I love the fact that there are high scores from all over the world, and that each week you have a chance to read gold! This game does have ads, but not the video type, which I think is amazing, because now I don’t have to turn off my WiFi!

In the game there are “glitches” and some people that hack in to get a high score or to just get coins or get something from the event and thats just really annoying to me.
Anyways you get the options to buy characters or boards and you also collect keys in the middle of your run so it can help you buy stuff too if you don’t have enough coins! 
There are multiple events, and right now I’m playing the 10th years old event with super runner yutani and it never gets boring, the map changes a lot and yeah, it’s really cool and impossible to be boring and I could play it all day. 👏🏻😘",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-18T08:22:51-07:00

I played it on my Kindle when was three and I just downloaded it again a week or two ago. It’s just as amazing and addictive as it used to be. I also love the fact that it would increase reaction time, since the point of the game is dodging and jumping over things while collecting coins. The only missing is that although I love the characters, and I love that they're in keeping with the storyline of a late teens graffiti artist running from the police, it would be cool to have a bubblegum princess type character, for those of us who are more feminine. Even just a girl with long hair that’s not dyed, converse, high waisted jeans or jean shorts, and a fitted tee would be great, to fit in with the more normal characters. It would also be cool to have a girl with blond hair that’s curly, and a ballgown on just makes her look kind of like a fairy godmother, and maybe some wings, which would fit into the more absurd characters.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-18T13:11:23-07:00

The day after I redownloaded it and already played it it would not load. I would leave it for ten minutes and it would still not load. I emailed the company and they never got back to me. It has been about two months. Another problem is that the new update (in my opinion) has made the game look very old and childish. It looks like it is from the 90s. I highly dislike the new style of the game. I also purchased double coins many years ago and now I cannot get it back even when I restore my purchase. I’m not going to waste my time emailing the company because I will not get an answer. The items in the game are also way too expensive. It took me almost 3 weeks of playing for about 45 minutes a day to get the hoverboard that I wanted.

Then my phone died and I was so angry. But you can’t just get angry, just try again. I didn’t give up on my game just because my phone died. So if you play this game, you have to have dedicated time. I had it a few years ago and just got it back. And I enjoy it so much. Plus I don’t have Instagram or Snapchat so whenever my friends are on it I just bust out my subway surfers. It’s a good game if you want to pass time. There are different challenges you can complete for keys that get you outfits for other characters.

I was playing the Event where you can earn super runner fresh if you complete all 5 stages, and i got to about stage three, I believe. I have the hoverboard. I was in the middle of playing and I died to i decided to revive myself with an advertisement. The app weirdly closed out during the ad so I reopened it and my score reset. I was very upset about this until I did some research and found out I might have to log in with apple or something. Now me personally, I prefer to play it on my iPad because the screen is bigger. I don't know if it's an iPad thing, or because I already have progress I can't log in, but in settings, there is no option to log in. I also tried on the Phone though and it still didn't work!

It’s still a very good game, but I just wish I could go back to what it was before. It is just so much simpler and personally, for me better. I’m not saying you have to take out all the seasons, but maybe make an option where you don’t participate in the season’s like you can change the music of the beatbox.

(not true in my opinion)

As an anime lover, the new skin (Tokyo Surfer) thats wearing a school uniform just gave me an idea for you guys to make a whole anime event. Like cosplayers (people who dress like people in animes), or just the actual people from events. I’m currently watching Attack On Titan , and I’d love for you guys to add an attack on titan event! The boards could be the “ODM gear” Search “Odm gear attack on titan” and you’ll understand what it is. You could add Eren from that anime, and in the Eren’s second outfit he could be in his titan form! Or Kakegurui characters.

Second, there are things in the middle of the tracks which makes it confusing because I can’t exactly see when a subway is coming. Third, when I get a pogo stick, sometimes it glitches and I end up being half on the roof and half off. Finally, sometimes when sneakers or magnets pop up on the tracks, I’ll bypass them and they give me it anyway.

I’m not really sure but maybe it could make the game a bit more..uhhhmm.. interesting? The choice is really up to you! Next suggestion, I also think it would be nice if you had a pet to go on the run with you. I was thinking a dog or cat, maybe even a tiger!

Almost as soon as I got my first phone I downloaded the app. It is a great way to pass time when your bored or just waiting for something. The music that goes with this game so is catchy and upbeat that is just makes the game a whole lot better. This game also makes you want to buy stuff to get other new things quicker then you would by just playing it. I have bought a few things but it’s just a good game to play and I wouldn’t really recommend buying things unless you just wanna finish the game all together, and I don’t. If you are fine with the characters and boards that you have, if just a waste of money buying coins to get new ones. 
A person who really enjoys the game, like me, would want to play the game instead of buy things to get brand new things, but you should also support it if you enjoy it. Thanks for reading 😊💜",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-13T18:29:59-07:00

So I was once just like living in a van working at arbys for money getting 3 dollars an hour. And bro I wanted to go take a nap on a highway because of how bad my life was. When I found this phone in the bathroom stall and it was on subway surfers so I picked it up and started playing and that was when my life changed. I started playing it all the time like I never stoped and I was the best player in the world on my phone. But then I was walking down the street when a bird came and snatched my phone. I was so sad that I jumped of a 3 story building but I survived. I wasn't trying to survive but I did. Now I'm paralyzed from the neck up and in the hospital. I still live in my van and still work at  arbys but now I'm paralyzed from the neck up and so yeah I guess it changed my life but not in that good of a way.

It’s fun, super enjoyable, and totally deserves to be awarded the BEST GAME EVER AWARD (if there is such a thing. I love the world tour thing, bc it gives players a chance to get new characters and hover boards each time. Plus a new scene to play! 
 As I was playing, I thought of a great idea and I think the developers should absolutely consider it. Ready??? 
DESIGN YOUR OWN CHARACTER!!!!!! I think for a certain amount of coins or keys,( bc most kids like myself aren’t allowed to spend money on games) it would be awesome to be able to design your own character! If you’ve ever played *Toca life world* and designed your own character there, you know how they do it. It’s really cool. You could provide a choice of make or female, skin color, hair styles, hair color, choice of clothes, eye color, eye brow color, eye brow shape, and things like that. It would be awesome!!!!!!

But one problem I have concerns the difficulty in accessing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color characters. They are there, but inaccessible. The first character everyone has to play with is a white boy / man. The next character that becomes available is a white girl / woman, after collecting three red hats, which are given generously without even trying. Another white character only costs 7,000 coins. I would like to play with Black characters. But I need to collect 50 stereos to access the Black character Fresh. The stereos are not easy to come by - they are sometimes awarded for achieving milestones or buying mystery boxes. The Black character Ella costs 150,000 coins. Prince K costs 980,000 coins. This structure makes it hard to access the BIPOC characters. The leaderboards may reflect this problem, as many people may play with white characters just because they are available. The game is often uncomfortable to me for this reason, and I previously deleted the app. If you really want to embrace racial and cultural diversity, make BIPOC characters accessible to players.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-08T19:37:04-07:00

But it’s super annoying how the game is putting skins for actual money. I appreciate how they’re making those expensive deals in the shop for coins and keys. Another thing, I think the upgrades for the power ups are very annoying and a bit over priced. It’s also very annoying using the super shoes and then you uncontrollably fall/jump into the wall arc thingies.

One thing, though. I had played the game for hours trying to get 100,000 coins for one of the deals, and everything was incredibly laggy the night when I finally got enough to buy it. I go into the store through all of the lag, click the buy button, and then when nothing happens for a minute, I close the game, reopen it, and all my coins are gone, and i didn’t even get the avatar, board, nothing.

I love the maps + characters and the way they made it is so creative. Though… there is one really annoying problem in a middle of a run sometimes you watch a add it doesn’t show anything it’s just black and so you have to do then run all over again. Second problem sometimes the screen freeze’s so that makes you have to do it all over again. LAST PROBLEM though I’m kinda addicted to this game this is a problem I personally hate all you have to do is click something and if you have enough you just get that thing WITH NO SECOND WARNING because sometimes I click on stuff by accident like I did today I clicked on a character I really didn’t want but I didn’t know I had enough keys (80 keys) so I clicked on it just wanting to know the price of keys and with no second warning I just got the character it was so upsetting I wasted 80 keys on something I didn’t want. :(,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-18T08:02:22-07:00
9292436010,Ethoteric,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id493364382,3.3.1,5,Classic game since Temple Run.,"I’ve been playing this game since high school back when all I had was my mom’s giant iPad. It’s easy for anyone to pick up and play, and incredibly fun. I also like that unlike Temple Run, it doesn’t go based off of your phone’s movements so I can play in the comfort of my bed without having to worry about my character only running on one side of the screen.

I think in terms of the rewards you get, it can be pretty confusing because there’s so many different tabs and gifts to open and I wasn’t sure what I got from doing what, but no real complaints about that since we’re getting rewarded. Just wish we could claim rewards from one tab as opposed to five different other tabs. Makes the main menu look too chaotic with all the numbered notifications.

Other than that, still a great game. Glad it’s still around.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-15T07:55:56-07:00

It is that great! My little sisters originally got this app and that’s why I got the app. We always enjoy playing it together. No matter how old you are this game grows with you. I love the fact that the location of where the game takes place always changes and you get to observe different characteristics of each different place. My cousin introduced me to this app and I immediately fell in love. It is absolutely addicting! I also enjoy this game rather than others is because you can earn coins a lot quicker than other apps. On subway surf you can earn 1000 coins in two runs from videos and bonus gifts. While in other games it could take you two days to two weeks to earn that much. I would 100% recommend this to everyone and this is definitely a great add!!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-20T09:32:56-07:00

This is a game that I will never delete off my phone . I have played for so long I have accumulated quite a lot of characters and I assume anybody who has played as long as I have would also have lots of character's and that’s where my suggestion comes in. I would like to see a way to have a random surfer. I have so many that sometimes I use just one because I don’t feel like switching every time. If there was an option to make the surfer one random surfer out of all the ones u have I think it would be a great addition to the game. While your at it might as well do the same thing for the boards. Being able to play with all your characters in all different types of outfits I think would be quite fun. Hope u take the suggestion.

I also love the new locations for the game which adds challenges and a new character!
But there are also a bad thing about this game. It resets. Why? I want to figure that out. I just don’t know. It resets all of my stuff, and it goes back down to as if I have just downloaded it, which I obviously haven’t. I have been playing this game for years, since 5th grade!

There are a few things I would change tho. First of all I don’t like how all the characters are really expensive I only have 10k and I can afford is a robot. I think you should make the characters be less expensive. Also I think that you should make that police officer that chases you I little bit more faster. The update looks a lot like a kid just made it. I personal like the game without the update. But I have also been playing for a long time. Also I think you should have more boasts because the ones that you have are a little bit boring and don’t go on for that long. But I do love that you get faster when you stay alive for longer.

(Since 3 years ago),"I played Subway surfer from the very beginning until that horrid update about 3 years ago. I literally deleted the game after 1 run. Recently I got bored and decided to try out the new graphics. To my surprise the game is back to normal and has even added new challenges which I like. Mystery hurdles is my favorite even though I’ve yet to get the top prize. I love that I can see more characters and boards at the same time and can mark favorites.

  I dislike Frizzy’s name change and that “Ella as a nickname for elephant” crap used to explain why. You could have just stuck to “Ella after Ella Fitzgerald”. I’m guessing you changed the name to not be offensive but that “Rasta” outfit is the most offensive thing about any of the characters. I also dislike being able to obtain so many tokens while the prizes they’re for take days to unlock.

Me and my brothers have been competing against each other. This gets to my point, the leaderboard is very helpful because you can see other player’s score and compete against each other.  It’s also cool how you can compete in contests kind of and get prizes. I feel like the keys are too expensive to buy with cash, same with keys, you can use ads for coins and keys, which makes up for that.

With that said, I don’t want to bail on Subway Surfers. It’s still a really fun game. It’s super tempting to buy characters with actual money, and they advertise a lot, so it kind of distracts from the game, though. Prize boxes are alway follow by a video advertising some other game I’m assuming is going to soon be in competition with Subway Surfers. It’s like they want to set up a rivalry. Which is good for business, because then there are two major games, but at the same time, advertising costs money and cost means deduction, and we haven’t even gotten in to how much they’re going to have to pay their character artists to keep renewing the drawings.

9597287364,28twixkat,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1497227607,3.7.0,4,Great game overall,"I have been playing this game for a long time now and it is really fun but there are a few things I don’t like about it. If you’ve ever tried to complete the achievements for no jumping or rolling, you can’t use a hover board because it restarts your progress and counts it as a jump if you crash. therefore you have to either sit there watching annoying ads every five seconds or spend a lot of keys. I probably lost over 30 keys just trying to skip the ads in one run and I didn’t even get the achievement
It also costs a lot of coins for power ups just to get a head start or boost. It doesn’t seem like too much to get one or two of them but it can deplete your coins really fast 
I also was playing once and had a really high score and over 20,000 coins but when I came back to the game it had restarted and I lost all that progress
Otherwise, love the game overall",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-08T13:23:55-07:00

I should know I’ve been playing this game for 7 years!!!!!!! You can get coins while your running and you can collect mystery boxes with things like coins, boards, items to unlock things, and keys. The keys are for when you hit something you can use them to keep going and sometimes you can just watch an add if you don’t have enough keys. You can use coins to by stuff. While your running you can collect letters that spell into the weekly word then you get a mystery box when you collect all the letters. Also this game is really fun so you would really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really want to download this game,      it’s super fun.😋😛😝😜😊😁😄😃😀😎☺️😅👍🏻👌👍🏻👌",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-19T17:36:17-07:00
