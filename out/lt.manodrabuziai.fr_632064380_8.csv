And shipping prices were the best I had seen which made it seem like it‚Äôd be a very popular app. Personally haven‚Äôt had any problems ordering items or selling and getting my money. 

Then out of nowhere the prices for shipping basically DOUBLED without warning or given reason. It was sneaky and not noticed at first since nothing was said about it. Makes it completely undesirable for me now as most of my items were listed at $5 or less, and every shipping option costs more than that. Small items shipping went from $3.99 to $6.92. And medium is now nearly $13, JUST TO SHIP. That doesn‚Äôt include any envelopes, boxes, tape or other packaging materials you have to buy. Nobody is going to want to buy a $3 shirt and pay nearly $7 just to receive it. Price gouging the heck out of customers AND sellers.

Everything was either taken, not a ‚Äúreal name‚Äù, or not at least 3 characters (because there was a space). I spent at least an hour keyboard smashing or just putting in anything I could think of and nothing was accepted. You know it‚Äôs a sorry excuse of an app if you can‚Äôt even get into the app itself.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-30T21:29:04-07:00

They always had the best prices and reasonable shipping prices but a little over a month ago they suddenly DOUBLED their shipping prices without any warning. Since then I haven‚Äôt bought anything because I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that the shipping cost is 2, sometimes 3 times the amount of the item for sale.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-30T19:08:46-07:00
