Back in the early days of public internet awareness, there was Usenet, where you would subscribe to threads of interest to you. Today, the successor to Usenet is Reddit.  You join groups called subreddits, dedicated to topics that interest you,  often when going through these subreddit discussions, you find links to other subreddits, from people of similar interest.  Many subreddits have great followings and a great sense of community.  Topics are diverse with minimal censorship, determined by the groups moderators.  If you don't like the content or censorship of it, there is always another subreddit more to your liking.  There are many Reddit readers out there, many of them good.  This is the original.

Issues. 1. There’s a lot of forces ap use. Let ppl view in browser. 2. If you have the ap it feels like it forces you into a consumer role. I could waste a lot of time scrolling but the algorithm that keeps it that way is very hive-Minded. Posts that are liked are shown to many people. Things that are not liked by the first 1-2 people that look at them are shown to no one (it seems). I made 1 post (a cat photo) that no one interacted with and made another post (that didn’t break rules) that got flagged and taken down because a BOT decided my title was boring. I’m not saying I deserve likes/attention to the thing I post. However I think this funneling of likes onto certain posts forces most users into passive viewer roles where the ap doesn’t do much for you but take your time.

Lots of echo chambers and the anonymous aspect creates a lot of negativity. The app itself is fine, except I just redownloaded it after a few months of having the app deleted and the interface is completely new and unintuitive now. I used to tap a post then scroll down to read the comments. Now the comments are like their own weird extra bar that moves funky. The worst bug (or is it a feature?) is when I tap a video. Now the audio will auto play even when I have scrolled away. There’s no simple way to mute the audio with a tap (it used to auto mute when I scrolled down to read the comments but now it keeps looping) then if I go up to mute it, it puts me back into the video player and I lose my spot in the comments. 

Honestly not a bad thing as I try to limit my time on Reddit so the more the app annoys me the more I stay away from using it. 

Also if it’s a NSFW marked video, if I tap it once I can watch it, but if I leave and go back to watch it again a random video plays every time and I can no longer view the original video again. Honestly the new video interface is garbage.

The new UI, specifically, the ""news"" and ""popular"" tabs, along with the recommended communities/posts tabs, have been mostly an annoyance. I understand the satisfaction of these tabs, but I wish I had the option to disable them and view my solely my home tab. Reddit is wonderful because of the personalization it allows, where one user's experience differs entirely from another's. 

However, because of all the additional content being thrown towards me, most of it either completely disagreeable to me or simply not interesting, I feel my Reddit experience has been compromised. I don't use Reddit for politics, news, etc. I use Reddit to interact with a variety of individuals from the same academic discipline as me, for gaming highlights, and for memes. It's not hard to see that I have no interest in ANY political subreddit -- especially the large ones -- most news subreddits, or anything else that simply comes off as hostile in nature.

I’ve been using Reddit for a couple years now and the app’s functionality is really disappointing. Videos often won’t play and everything is very slow to load. The poor quality video player and the limited available accessibilities make it necessary to use a 3rd party app (such as Apollo or Reddit Is Fun).
But here’s the catch, Reddit’s new CEO, Steve Huffman, is about to make it impossible for third party apps to remain an available resource, while simultaneously making no effort to match the services that the apps provide.

When scrolling on a subreddit's Top - All-time feature, there is a seemingly random/indeterminable point at which no content will load. When finding a new sub (or taking a break from one and revisiting it), I like to go back and see what type of content gets appreciated most there! This constraint really puts a damper on that. 

The interface is very sensitive. Sometimes I’m on a post or a subreddit I am enjoying, then a very slight tap or swipe of my finger will send me to my previous page or the top of the feed. If there were some way to make the interface less sensitive to minor gestures made on the screen, it would greatly improve usability for many users, in my opinion. 

Finally, some comments seem to be randomly hidden and have to be expanded? They aren’t downvoted at all, but are still just not displaying. I’m not sure if that’s in the app or if that’s a mod/admin decision, though.

The old saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Whoever is in charge of the app obviously hasn't heard this, as they keep cramming in unnecessary updates with things nobody asked for. 
This latest update that I was forced to endure doesn't load gifs or most pictures, so I have to go through a series of clicks to open up whatever I'm trying to look at in Safari and it's mostly not worth it.
Also, I absolutely hate the new ""next up in r/___"" that's sandwiched between the content and comments. Why have you done this? Who decided this would be a good idea? 
Lastly, stop recommending the same ads/posts from the same communities over and over. If I wasn't interested the first time, I won't be interested the next 200 times either.
Honestly a few months ago I would've given the app more stars but it just keeps getting worse and worse, so here we are.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2018-07-02T09:49:59-07:00
2009099101,R4di4ti0n,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id101572336,4.0.0,1,Stop with the constant changes,"This is the worst update so far. Reddit keeps updating their app and “adding” features, but it is taking away usability. The most recent one is a huge deviation from standard practices- they added the ability to “swipe through” your front page, meaning that if you click an image and swipe, it will go to the next post in your front page automatically.

Sounds good? Well, swiping from the side is the  universal way to back in most reasonable apps. So your instinct is to swipe back, which loads another image and frustrates you, meanwhile they changed it to be swiping up from the bottom is how you move back???

How does that make sense? I swipe UP to move BACK, and a swipe BACK, to move DOWN my list of links. It is not intuitive and is incredibly frustrating.

And, to complicate things further, their text only posts or comments, still require you to swipe back?!

This is in addition to them taking away to easily load the direct link in safari, them making it so certain images don’t collapse at the top of threads (ones hosted on their own service) and make it difficult to read comments, and a whole host of other “improvements” that are improvements to nobody.

I honestly just wish this app didn’t change every 36 hours. It seems like every time I open it up there are more buttons, colors, gestures, or font changes to deal with, and none of them make it a better experience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-19T05:28:27-07:00
10008634549,vvoozerz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1491444958,2023.22.0,3,API needs improvement,"First and foremost, the app is great. The amount of information you can find whether it be an answer to the most basic of questions, to information on a super obscure and niche topic, Reddit has you covered! The only real issue I have with Reddit is their API. For example, say I search for something on safari, and a search result that links me to Reddit appears. If I click that link (to Reddit) I’ll be redirected to the App Store, even though I already have the app installed. And when I do open the app from the App Store it only takes me to home page of Reddit. This is an issue because some of the threads linked on safari are nearly impossible to find by a simple search in Reddit’s search bar. It’s extremely annoying and it shows a lack of forethought in regards to Reddit’s architecture. I hope this issue can be resolved in the future.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-07T06:14:28-07:00
