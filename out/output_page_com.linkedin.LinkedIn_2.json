Well, that is until recently. Over the past few months, it does nothing but crash, crash, crash! Every time I do anything more than browse through newsfeeds or search for profiles/jobs, it crashes. Try to write an article on the app...crash! Try to apply to a job...almost always crashes! Try to download or save something from the app....I can guarantee it will crash!\n\nPlease get this fixed so everyone from baby boomers to millennials and today‚Äôs college kiddos can utilize LinkedIn where they need it most....on their mobile device. Many thanks!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-05-10T08:23:34-07:00"}]
