I suggest adding the ability to create multiple functions that can be customized for different tasks - Custom Instructions for ChatGPT. This will allow users to create instructions and scenarios, tailoring the model's behavior to specific tasks. This feature will make ChatGPT a much more flexible and useful tool for various domains, including education, entertainment, and many others. For user convenience, I also propose adding the ability to change the names of the Custom Instructions themselves and including tabs in the same menu. This will make it easier for users to navigate between instructions and select the desired mode, avoiding the need to manually edit and save them in notes. Please also include a default standard mode so that users can use it without deleting their own Custom Instructions.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.
