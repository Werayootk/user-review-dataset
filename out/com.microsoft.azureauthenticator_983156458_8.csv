I can add a new account on my iPhone, and it will show up in the Google authenticator app on my Android phone. And vice versa. 

When I discovered these options with the other apps, I ditched Microsoft authenticator, though I would like to have it on this app which I still have to hold onto it for my Microsoft accounts.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-14T15:17:21-07:00

Cool.

So I tap on sign in. It errors immediately and offers to let me send my logs to MS to report the issue.

Cool.

I write up a description of the issue and attach the logs and hit the submit button.

A loading indicator pops up that tells me its sending and 15 minutes later it is still spinning.

I kill the app.

Even the tool to report the issues is broken ðŸ’€",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-14T01:25:44-07:00
