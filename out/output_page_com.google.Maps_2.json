It would be nice if they could add a feature to avoid construction.

Well, here’s why. First of all, I use Apple Maps as well, and that app will usually give me more convenient directions/routes to certain places. For instance, if I’m going to the mall and I put it into Apple Maps, it will send me the route that I’d normally take anyway. However, this is not the case with Google Maps. It will usually take me routes that rarely anyone would take to get to said destination, and I’ve found that I would arrive a few minutes later than I would have if I had taken the route I normally take. It also will sometimes glitch while I’m driving and tell me to turn at the very last second, causing me to either slam my brakes or completely miss the turn. This is very frustrating, especially on the thruway. Both of the issues I’ve talked about seem very fixable, and I hope they eventually get fixed and fast because a lot of people use this app and rely on it to get them places every day.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-12-07T20:24:14-07:00"},{"id":"3642594174","userName":"Joker5456","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id156426204","version":"5.8","score":3,"title":"It’s still the best....except","text":"I’ve been using Google maps since it first came out and it’s been great, except for a couple minor issues.

To read the street names you have to switch between the text route and the map route.

I actually feel somewhat discriminated by this sorting of reviews. Showing the most helpful reviews (helpfulness rated by other reviewers) is a much fair and meaningful way. Third, the Google Translation is imbedded no matter people complain about it. They seemed to stop translating English into Chinese now but it continues to “translate” Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese (my iOS language), which is absolutely unnecessary (99.9% Chinese speakers can recognize both ways of writing). Even worse is that in the last version I found some reviews are shown with the tags “translated” and “original” but there isn’t any content after “translated”; basically, it didn’t “translate” but has those tags, which wastes space that I only see “translated” and a space line before clicking the review to expand it.

I live in a big city and so far the Google speed has matched the posted speed and even changed when I cross over an intersection, then the speed limit changes.\n\nIf you don’t like the speed limit feature, it can be turned off in the settings / navigation screen of the app.\n\nOffline maps are an absolute life saver for instanced where you travel to areas where cell signals are intermittent or weak. They are easy to setup and remove.\n\nSo far, on the iPhone I have not had a single issue with this app., unlike the dreaded Apple maps that to this day, doesn’t always give me the proper directions, and takes too long to figure out when I veer off the path. Google maps, responds instantly, and reroutes you eliminating a lot of stress.\n\nIn a case where you find an error in routing, if it’s reported to google, they will listen to you and fix it. Be patient though as they have to verify it, before they change it. They have a feature within the app that should be turned on by default, where you shake the phone with the app. open, the the feedback screen pops up.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-01-19T10:58:28-07:00"},{"id":"7375400002","userName":"lobster15526487","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id149936948","version":"5.69","score":3,"title":"Good data, okay routing","text":"The map data is really useful, and it even knows construction zones maybe half the time.

Not sure what they did to this last update but I’ll be finding an alternative now.\n\nEDIT IN RESPONSE: Typically I’d be navigating based on latitude/longtitude coordinates but it also happened when setting a destination based on address. I also found that it tended to send me back to certain locations repeated times as long as they were within a mile or so of the actual destination. I have no saved addresses so that wouldn’t have been the cause.\n\nEDIT 1/31: Yes, I’d be using Safari and a link that opened Google Maps with the coordinates prefilled. The destination would always be accurate for a few minutes but the route would silently change on me and point me to somewhere totally different, sometimes up to a mile away in a completely different direction nowhere close to the original destination.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-01-31T08:16:41-07:00"},{"id":"5788910777","userName":"jdhyndjjgr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id627780576","version":"5.41","score":1,"title":"It’s google trash","text":"Just like everything else with google things keep going downhill (especially the search engine). Maps gets worse with every update. Worst is it never keeps up with movements and distance despite any change to any settings that google recommends it stays about 10-15 seconds behind. I ride a motorcycle and there is no way with the gloves I have to touch the screen. It detects traffic and sends me down a different route that takes twice as long and I can’t cancel it. When planning trips where I know the route I want to take and I set it to that yet googles mighty reroute thinks it can’t shave a minute off by sending me down side streets. By thinking it can save that one minute I end up in rural side streets and distant loops that end up taking longer. \nOver maps is terrible. Lately I’ve had to memorize the route before hand and keep the app off while traveling, defeating the point of GPS maps. If they fixed the app so it kept up with movement and basic direction that would be a good start. Then add options like “never change pre-planned route” and and option to not take traffic into account as much for motorcycles that lane split. Just give people a few more settings","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-04-09T20:10:28-07:00"},{"id":"2151170947","userName":"peemree","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id203827802","version":"4.44","score":4,"title":"Google Maps, I love you, but...","text":"By far one of my most frequently used, long-running apps. And now I live in NYC so have become obsessed with the new feature allowing us to label places as “want to go”, etc. My only complaint with Google Maps is its lag time in catching up to my location. It can sometimes take 5, 10+ minutes for the app to update my location from when previously used. My one *request* is that the app have more options to customize the pins! Example: when creating a new list, it would be helpful if there were multiple colors to choose from, rather than just having the baby blue option. This would help to distinguish between categories when looking at the map alone (rather than having to go and search through the lists). Maybe even allow for a custom-made option, such as using an emoji as a category instead of a color at all? This would be a total game changer and so improve my use of the app when searching for specific cuisines, unique features, etc.!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-01-31T14:35:40-07:00"},{"id":"4227945867","userName":"Little Blind Girl","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id698046733","version":"5.18","score":5,"title":"My review","text":"I like this app. I don't drive, so if you do, can't help ya. But, I can tell you the app is wonderful at finding stuff in the area. 5 out of 5. \nProblems: I am a blind user and your app is almost perfect. One problem is on the For You tab, which I would love to use, but it wants me to select an area I care about on a map, which I can't do by any means. The second problem, most likely having nothing to do with me being blind, is when I have to press back to my location in order for it to measure distance correctly. \nSuggestions:  I have two suggestions that would help me and possibly some others. The first one is for it to tell you the bus stop numbers. The second one is a notification you could turn on to tell you that your stop on the bus is getting close. This would be useful because not all the buses have the speaker system and even if I ask the driver to tell me a little heads up would be nice. \nOver all, this app is very wonderful.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-05-28T20:10:06-07:00"},{"id":"3668131448","userName":"Kariidee","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id452111855","version":"5.9","score":5,"title":"Google you need to read this.","text":"I’ve been using google maps since forever! I cannot give them a bad review. Yeah, there may be and continue to be little details that many people may want to change and so forth but I consider it to be a great gps. \n\nAnyways I’m contacting google through the App Store to let you guys know that while I’ve been using google maps for work to complete my deliveries. I’ve noticed that the many places I go to make these deliveries the gps points me out to the incorrect locations most of the time. I usually have to go and find the addresses blindly  until I can locate my customers location.  \n\nI am not sure if you’ve sent out a driver to Lauderdale Lakes, Florida to update the street views and new developments. But there are many new buildings and older buildings standing today that google maps hasn’t updated on. Hopefully, google maps can update this soon enough.

Forget all the other apps because they’re never as accurate nor as intuitive. Google has more resources to notify within seconds of schedule changes, quicker than the respective government agency where the delay may be (ie Muni accidents might not show up for 20 mins on predictions, yet Google Maps will immediately notify you and offer reroute)So no matter where you are traveling from, forget Muni app, or 511, or BART, etc., just coordinate your schedule through Google Maps. I also recommend getting a Clipper Card. Easiest way to keep track of transit passes and if you’re not sure your schedule you can just load cash which is redeemable on all transportation systems (though obviously passes are your best value).","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-01-23T04:53:17-07:00"},{"id":"9435243986","userName":"chercocoa","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1481059050","version":"6.48","score":4,"title":"Be careful selecting the routes","text":"Hi, if you saw the review I submitted last night, apologies that was my bad. My father had accidentally clicked the route for motorcycles hence why were led into the smallest roads to our destination. Maybe an audio recap of the route we pick when we click start would be great to confirm with us. That would be nice. Also I still think that the best route isn’t always the one with the least route, I’d rather go through the highway or main roads rather than small roads/shortcuts to get to my destination. Many people who use the app don’t know the area or direction so it’d be so great if google maps could somehow break the route down for us like what kind of roads we’ll be using, which road is best. Using small roads during the daytime is slightly better than at night, so maybe you could take that into consideration too—safety during different times of the day (among other important factors). Consider how the app will be used in many different countries too.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-25T19:17:32-07:00"},{"id":"5665528697","userName":"Andrea and Murray","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id724770660","version":"5.39","score":5,"title":"Warranty Exchange - Incredible Customer Service Experience","text":"Long story short.  Went to Mattress Firm and spoke with Mike Paso about what we thought was a defective mattress (bought back in 2013). He explained the process. We followed the process, and within less than 3 weeks we had a letter from the company giving us full credit (from our initial purchase) to apply to a new mattress. We went back to see Mike and he was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the products in the showroom. After learning a lot and lying on several beds, Mike made our decision a well-informed one. He consulted with another colleague at the store (Catherine- and she was also incredibly helpful) and in no-time our purchase was processed with our mattress refund applied. Thank you Mike for your amazing customer service - especially in today’s world of “go do it yourself” service. You truly made our experience a great one.

Google maps is taking strange back roads and not the most direct route. I don’t have the option to avoid major highways. For example. I routed from Ft. Worth, TX to Memphis, TN, and it was going to take 7 hours 53 minutes as the fastest route. I add a stop in Rockwall, TX to get it back on I-30. Adding this stop reduced the time of the alleged already “fastest route” to 7 hours 23 minutes. On what Earth, should adding a stop reduce the total travel time? The AI or routing is messed up friends at google. Even the notoriously bad Apple Maps can figure out a 7 hour route from Ft Worth, TX to Memphis, TN. This isn’t my only problem either. I was on a route on I-40 in NM, and google maps wanted me to get off I-40 and add an hour to my trip to go thru some small town to get back on I-40 all to avoid some alleged construction that wasn’t even taking place. I’ve had multiple instances on long trips where the suggested route has just been a bad suggestions.
