Then I roamed around the site and found several more crazy deals in a matter of minutes. Again, everything was as advertised, and so cheap I couldn’t believe they could ship the stuff for free. Now I’m addicted to them, I’m on order five or six already. The shipping is not like Prime, so be prepared to wait a bit, but so far nothing has taken more than about ten days. I just did a refund request on two items and was given instant credit, so customer service is fast and legit.

I love the extra discounts I get and coupons they send me. The biggest compliment I have is how they ship items. I have had several items come in damaged and had to get refunded. I hate when They send merchandise in the bags instead of boxes. But even when it’s sent in boxes the packing isn’t the best and things come in damage. That being said their return procedure very easy to do. The prices are unbelievable. And I love that they give you a price adjustment if the price goes down after you buy. However you have to check your orders daily to see if a price adjustment is available and you have to request it because it is not automatic. I will keep buying for sure because like I said I am addicted haha.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-21T07:08:58-07:00

Fast forward and hundreds of dollars later and tons of items… I’m hooked!!! The only item that was “ bad” which really wasn’t bad was a tshirt that had a hole under the arm, a manufacturer defect.

The rules gradually change to give you fewer rewards as you get closer to the goal. There’s a complete lack of transparency and integrity to the rules. They constantly remove ways to gain “water” or “fish food” etc, while giving you less progress for it. Unless you have dozens of people who have never played before and download the app for the first time, you’re out of luck. I understand that it shouldn’t be easy to get the rewards, but they also do not allow you to “pay the difference”. You either win it all, or get nothing and have to pay full price. Not only that, but of course the merchandise is largely low quality and not worth the money they want to charge for it. 

I did purchase some of the products to test their quality and have been unimpressed. I was trying to win some others to try because I wouldn’t pay for them again. The company has no honor.

I personally received and cashed out the 3 gift option. Some of the gifts are a little weird, but there are certain ones that are worth 20$ plus however much the other gifts are. I’d say a pretty good deal! On my first day I got the three free gifts and also 20$ worth of credits.

Everyone should take a look and see all that they have available to buy.

Also once you find what you’re looking for… if the size that you’re looking for isn’t available at that time… be sure to push the button to let them notify you when it’s available.

Since that day , I’m in love with Temu.

It took forever to figure out how to contact customer service to report a missing item.  They don’t make that easy to find at all, and there customer service is fully automated so you can’t speak to anyone.  Finally reported the item missing.  Had to take a picture of my order!  And a few days later my refund was still denied!  Because they claim they sent it! Like I would lie about not getting a $4 squeegee, out of a $140 order. Terrible customer support.

1st, (and I assume this is supposed to cut on shipping cost) the fact that almost everything comes wrapped only in Temu branded bags, I personally feel packaging could be a bit sturdier, while nothing I’ve received has been damaged beyond use, product poxes have come to me crushed in transit.
2nd, an option to reduce promotional emails, while I enjoy the discounts and notification of sale items in my cart, your themed promotions are a little much, I neglected to log into Temu for 24 hours and have 70+ email notifications in 1 day. please consider limiting the number of emails or at least giving us the option to select how frequently we are notified.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-16T07:15:08-07:00

Ofc, temu has its cons and pros but it mostly has very good deals and offers. Some examples of cons is that the shipping isn’t always settled and can take more days than wanted for a package to arrive. It can also charge extra money if not careful. But, the pros of temu is that you can actually win free stuff!! If you search free items it will show you a page in which it has a long list of free items. You may only choose five and in order to claim the free item you will be given a time limit in which you have to get the money to zero by then. You can also win money in PayPal which is AWSOME!!!!

If the person that you invited already has it then it’s 2 then 1 then .10 and then who knows. And if they are new it’s 4 and then 2 etc. making it nearly impossible or super annoying to get it.

Sure there’s some stuff that you can get for really cheap in there I did put those two stars for that but then if you get stuff and the total is below 10 then it makes you get more stuff until it’s above.

However they also have mini games to get free stuff. To get free stuff you need to invite people. While at the beginning it seems like an easy little game to get some cheap items, it turns into hours of work and in some of the games it takes days and every person you get to sign up gives you less and less of a reward but they’ll still show you as so close because the creators have no sense of how percentages work. 
I’ve seen more than a few people get addicted and spend their time just mindlessly clicking away at these games, ordering things they don’t need to make more items they don’t need free, only to have to start the whole thing over because they didn’t do enough for their free items, despite being at 99% for hours and playing all day doing whatever the game tells them to.

Frankly, most of products sold at Temu are nice and in good quality, but few electric ones do not work, and some products are poorly made (not quite meet the basic standard of products for sale in the market) Also, since Temu use only plastic bags to deliver, some stuff arrived with flattened or broken boxes.

A lot of the so called “offers” from the app were fake offers trying to get you to buy more or capture your data. For example, 1 offer was “free item for new user” so it asks you to pick an item. But after doing so, you are required to buy/select 6 more items at cost to get the 1 free. So it’s not really free.

I still don’t get my things shipped so I can’t review on that. 
Second, I went to their other offers of winning money, and it was all based off of inviting friends

I hated the fact that I just needed 1 diamond to get $100, and they just kept on cutting the 1 diamond into parts. (Even if the minimum of diamonds you could win would be 1 whole diamond) I feel it’s unfair that they won’t give you the “free” money because all they are seeking is to have more users install the app without giving anything in exchange.

In that game called Lucky flip, you are given 4 or 5 chances to flip a card and they will give you close to the amount of diamonds needed to get to your goal. Mine was 500 diamonds to get $100. When I got to 499 diamonds, the next person I’d invite would be the last one to get 1 diamond. But, instead, they gave me .5 diamonds. 

Don’t waste your time in those “free” money and things.  I assume it’s the same for everything, they tell you to invite, but they won’t give you anything anyways.

This can result in increased revenue for the company, which can be used to fund research and development of new products, as well as improve their current offerings. 

Secondly, by shipping to other countries, Temu can gain valuable insights into different markets and consumer preferences. This can help them tailor their products to better suit the needs of their customers, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. 

Finally, by expanding their shipping, Temu can establish themselves as a global brand, which can lead to increased brand recognition and awareness. This can help them compete with other companies in the same industry, and can also attract potential investors and partners. 

Overall, I think that expanding your shipping to other countries can be a great opportunity for Temu. However, there may be challenges and obstacles to overcome, such as shipping costs, customs regulations, and language barriers. Nonetheless, I believe that if Temu approaches this with a strategic and thoughtful plan, they can successfully expand their shipping and reap the benefits that come with it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-15T02:34:29-07:00
