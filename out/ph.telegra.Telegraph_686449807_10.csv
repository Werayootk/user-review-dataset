Also being able to see when the recipients viewed the message is a big plus.

25th Sept. 2022 UPDATE- ADDITION TO REVIEW :-
Good for nothing rascals. Had tried to upload huge videos and after completion of uploading they get cancelled and once again start from the beginning. At least if uploading huge files isn't supported, they should mention it instead of just rejecting without a word. People would think it was just an error and would repeatedly try.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-25T02:42:55-07:00

I just wanted to say it would be really nice if you could disable the double tab in quick reactions.
