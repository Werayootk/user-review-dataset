The first response to any query is automated and says to check the FAQs and reply if still not answered. The second response, if any, is unrelated to the query, and therefore as useless as the first response. The third response is nonexistent; WhatsApp support never sends more than one response after the automated message.

Let me explain. \n\nLet’s say for instance, someone texts you and you’re about to respond but you get a group notification. You attend to the group for a while and when you come back to your chat you may forget about the previous text. Time goes by and you have conversations with other people until you realize you didn’t respond to that one text from a day ago.\n\n The process of having to find the text itself whilst responding to others you may not have replied to; one by one is taxing .\n\nI suggest for the next update, maybe we can install an “Unread” filter that allows us to sort the messages by those opened and those unopened. This will really make it convenient for responding quickly and keeping in touch with all messages. This would make a huge difference honestly.\n\n I would really appreciate it if you took this concept into consideration.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-11T09:41:14-07:00"},{"id":"8258579605","userName":"yusra51701","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id469780170","version":"22.1.73","score":4,"title":"More privacy options!!","text":"I love this app, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE provide the options to turn off the “online” or “typing” status within message chats!
