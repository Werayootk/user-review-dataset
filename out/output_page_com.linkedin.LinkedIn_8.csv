I try to get help from linked in and they direct me to apple. Apple sends me to iTunes and iTunes can’t help me. This is all on email of course. Oh didn’t they tell you that these trillion dollar companies have done away with human interaction entirely. You can email and get a pre programed response or chat to their online robot or complain publicly like I’m now forced to do.

I can access my profile just fine when I am on the website, either using my phone or my computer, but when I try to download this application and login is where the issue comes from. I put in my login credentials, that I know are correct, and then I have to select a few pictures to prove I’m not a robot. I am the.

It just messes with my user experience and forces me to switch between the two.

Please fix your fix!!
UPDATE:
For some reason the videos it wanted me to see would not load on WiFi and the X to close it out would not work.

It otherwise works fine, but recently I wrote a decent-sized, thought-out comment — and made the mistake of switching apps for a few seconds. 

I switch back to LinkedIn, and while most sensible apps would allow you to continue where you left off…nope. Gone. I was like, “No way the app could be this bad,” so I scrolled down to the post I was responding to, hit the Comment button, and sadly…yes, my entire comment was gone.
