They come very late or they come on the last day they said it would come on, otherwise this is the one clothing app u go on and it‚Äôs all I need. And it isn‚Äôt all clothing. You can get home needs and things for pets and skincare products, it‚Äôs so crazy, that everything I need is on my phone and it will come to me soon. The reason why it comes so late is because my order is being shipped from California ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I‚Äôm on the whole other side of America. As I said before, that is the one flaw. One more thing. Everything is so cute and cheap!

Overall, I‚Äôve had a really good experience with them I would make sure to always go by their recommended sizing, as I‚Äôve found it to be very accurate (unlike others I‚Äôve tried following in the past) and always check the reviews to make sure you order the right size. App does not seem to have many problems that I‚Äôve noticed and have not had to deal with customer service yet so I cannot speak on actual service but the quality is great, only thing that is unfortunate is how backed up they are from the pandemic and is causing shipping to be take very long which is understandable hopefully things will go back to normal soon for everyone!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-31T22:47:48-07:00

I have ordered a few shipments from SHEIN, only to have something missing a few times. It‚Äôs okay, it was only a few dollars for the things I bought but it is still my money. When buying things, make sure to check the size chart. They have improved by adding returns (finally) because now you can return them. I still encourage you to read the titles correctly because I‚Äôve also made the mistake since some things are seen so similar on here. for my BIKINI girls, material is legit and comfy. All I ask is for you to please make sure the size fits because their bikinis come different even if you order the same style in different prints sometimes they come weird. I definitely recommend using this over paying tons of money for it somewhere else but just be careful. Also have heard rumors that they get your info, I‚Äôm already on here so who cares! Lol.

Not only that, but they are very affordable. I used to shop at DressBarn and Lane Bryant locally but both shops closed and not being able to try things on before I buy really limited my choices. With SHEIN their return policy makes my decisions easier knowing that I can return them for a full refund. Word to the wise: the return is free for the first return but what that means is if you order 10 items, try them all on and if you aren‚Äôt satisfied return however many you want. Just make sure you do the return all at once to insure it‚Äôs a free return. If you return one and then the next week decide to return another from the same order separately then you have to pay a return shipping fee. I‚Äôve never had any return issues. That way you can figure out what your size is since it can be a little different.

First I like SHIEN because the don‚Äôt just sell clothes, they sell room decor, makeup, phone cases, smart watches and they have like a lot of stuff. Second SHIEN sells shoes! There shoes r the BEST the have grunge shoes, wannabe Jordan‚Äôs, heels, aesthetic shoes, chunky shoes (skater shoes/ platforms). Third SHIEN prices are very cheap it depends what your buying. I saw pants that were $3.49 can u believe that!!  But makeup isn‚Äôt that cheap it‚Äôs about $4.99 (in my opinion that‚Äôs a lil expensive) but other than that SHIEN prices are very cheap. Fourth this is going to be a tip so SHIEN is actually in china. ‚ö†Ô∏èNOT TRYING TO BE RACIST‚ö†Ô∏è SHIEN says because it‚Äôs from china and the Asian people are a lil slim the clothes might be a bit small. So if your clothes r ever small it‚Äôs because the clothes are made in chain and they have Asian models which makes the clothes smaller.

Unfortunately, I started to play their mini game which promises you $100 if you get to a certain amount of diamonds. Not only did the game not reward me for the new users I had brought along, when I contacted customer service about it, I was guaranteed my last diamond needed to win. Once an invite finally went through, I only had received 0.2 diamond. Of course, I contacted customer service again about the problem with screenshots from the previous conversation. Instead of filling  my account with the money I would have won or figuring another way to resolve the problem - I was told to just play another round. I am in my last communication attempt with the customer service agent. If his response is the same then I will no longer be a customer of this store.

9764857808,g gi it ig,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1275162569,9.0.8,5,Love,"SHEIN has been put down because it is a ""fast fashion"" company but if you buy the right clothing, it will actually last a long time and is super cute. First the pros - the sizing is pretty spot on and if you read the reviews with the pictures You get a very good idea of what you're buying. I personally only buy clothing that has reviews with pictures and it has been pretty good. Also, the return process is super easy. I love that it is free to return items, and if you put the money back in your SHEIN wallet you get it fairly quickly. I have only done one return where I got the money back into my bank account and it also didn't take that long. They have sales & coupons all the time which makes it more affordable. Also, if you write good reviews with pictures, you get points to use towards your next purchase.
Now the cons - Some of the clothing doesn't look like the picture or is not very well-made even if you look at the picture reviews you sometimes get clothing that is not sewn right or has imperfections. Also some people don't know quality clothing and will rate something as good when it's not.
Other than that, I love all of the different styles they offer at an affordable price I got a couple of items from them and get a lot of compliments. I highly recommend SHEIN just don't use it as fast fashion and if you're going to do it that way, please give the clothing to the thrift store or the SHIEN resale app.

If you or your parents are iffy on buying from there there are a few things you should know.  It is a very good website with MANY MANY options so parents it's completely ok to order from and kids make sure you know your size because it gets confusing if u shop on kids.  If you are shopping in the women's the sizes are usually all true to size.  If you unsure about buying something scroll under the image and u see images of other people and their stats including their height, weight, size, etc.  They also have a feature to add clothing or whatever is and to your likes and even make a collection or like a folder of clothes to buy.  Overall shein has many opportunities to but good clothes and to earn points and it's a very good website if u need lots of clothes for cheap.  Also shipping if u live in the US will usually come in 14 days maybe a little more or less but yeah.

I have ordered on this brand a few times myself and I regret it . Shein has been around for about 5 years or less I don‚Äôt know . But this brand support child labor and is wasteful with their plastic and material used to be used for any other things. But most of all this brand is it known for the child labor kids about five or younger and up in China all around the globe are making these clothes for us and getting paid one dollar an hour. Barely getting any food tired getting starved while we are just buying the clothes. Day by day we are buying clothes from Zara,Uniqlo,yestyle,forever 21 H&M and way more . If we keep this up we probably will even have a great planet to live on so nows the time we make a change in everything. Instead of buying all these clothes we should go to second hand stores even if ur your the only one doing this your still making a difference.

          I live for your clothes, they are so cute. I just have one suggestion for you guys, if a order come‚Äôs  in two different packages can you separate the orders so if one arrives before the other they can click confirm delivery but if they ordered the wrong size in the other package they can cancel it. I order the wrong size in pants all the time, I have a really small waist so nothing really fits me there and I‚Äôm short as well so a lot of the pants are too long for me.

Some people might say it‚Äôs not trustworthy or bad quality but I disagree. Every single time I‚Äôve ordered from Shein, my clothes have came on time, very well packaged, and I loved them. Honestly, there are only two problems I have. The first is with the 10-12 year old clothing. I‚Äôve been shopping at this store for about 4 years since I was 11 and this problem came up around that time. I ordered some clothes for myself but when they came, the material was weird and they didn‚Äôt look quite like the picture. HOWEVER: Before you start thinking that this store is untrustworthy, it‚Äôs really only the 10-12 year old clothing that is like that. ALWAYS look at reviews! My second problem is with the packaging. They use way to much plastic. Every single clothing item is packaged in its own bag of plastic. It‚Äôs not just Shien though, it‚Äôs many companies. But it would be really nice if the plastic amount could be reduced!

You definitely see a small amount of models of brown of decent modeling SHEIN products. Why is that? Oddly I see more diversity in the reviews and comment section on SHEIN website. 

I know my review may not be consider but I not only shop SHEIN brand for myself, I also shop for my two children as well. As a fond customer of the SHEIN brand, I would love to see more diversity amongst your models and more culture-geared promotions as well. I would love to see more models men, women and children of a variety of sizes, since you sell products varying in size.

I‚Äôve tried not to take it on here because you guys have really cute clothing but you guys have to get some better costumer service. Not only the fact that you guys have no customer service number, is already bad enough.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-01T10:52:41-07:00
8850311896,lily is amazing and cool,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id956053121,8.3.2,5,Us Shein now it‚Äôs 100% worth it,I love Shein so much it is usually my go to when getting clothes. I‚Äôve had a lot of people say buy you clothes early because shipping takes so long but usually my packages come early so that‚Äôs a plus for me. I just love how Shein has my style and a mix of other ones. Usually I can‚Äôt find my style or stuff I like online shopping unless it‚Äôs Shein. I just started using Shein this year 2022. And so far I have bought around 6 outfits and a ton of jewelry. I might have had one problem in all my experiences but it was partly my fault. I 100% recommend using Shein to online shop. They don‚Äôt just have clothes they also have makeup and home decor. Best thing is they have all sizes even plus and petite and children. I think that Shein is the best go to online shop to get what you need. The prices are also insane there always low and they always have sales and you get a lot of coupons!!! The clothing is very good material to!!!.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-07T09:09:32-07:00
6859616977,ShaSha and Kelvington,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1028089530,7.4.3,5,AMAZING,"SHEIN is overall an amazing app. Sometimes the packages come late of there not the perfect size, but NOTHING CAN BEAT THOSE PRICES. It‚Äôs literally like your buying from a thrift store but the clothes are so cute. They have all of the trendy clothes right now as of tennis skirts, oversized graphic tees, and literally stuff for every single aesthetic. You can find ANYTHING here for under $10. The shoe prices are absolutely insane ALSO. I found these beautiful knee high boots on H&M‚Äôs for $177. ON SHEIN THERE $45. Before you ask, the quality is amazing and I couldn‚Äôt want it better. The stuff bought looks exactly like the picture and is exactly what explained. There are review places to see other people‚Äôs opinions WITH PICTURES, so you know exactly what you are getting. Also, they have CLOTHING FOR KIDS. Toddlers, teens, they have it. All the stuff on there matches all of the trends and what kids like. Most of the clothes are under $10 and are extremely affordable.

I had been waiting for at least a year on two items, between not having the money and it not being in stock, then I finally got them in an unpaid order and I‚Äôm TWO DAYS away from having the money and they were deleted from the site.. and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing similar to them.. I saw that today and I want to scream and just cry honestly.. the one I guess I could make myself if I get a cricket or whatever it‚Äôs called, but I have no clue how to make a skirt..",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-23T14:13:55-07:00

And all I can say is it just keeps getting better. First off there are so many items to choose from. Which makes it easy to find something that matches your style. Or something perfect for certain events. And they always offer opportunities for you to receive a discount or a deal with any items you‚Äôre looking to purchase. And if you get an item that you can‚Äôt fit or just don‚Äôt like the return process is free and they will work with you to make you a happy customer. Their shipping time is quicker than you‚Äôd expect. On average my order always come within 7 or 9 days, which is always surprising to me. And recently with the newest update to the app, you can now see the different sellers/stores within SHEIN that you‚Äôre items are coming from in your cart before you check out. Which is something I really appreciate!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-16T09:09:09-07:00
10642601629,i havn't gotten rewards yet,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1299364129,10.0.3,2,My review of SHEIN,"This is a great app if your looking for things and you want to get them cheap! Don‚Äôt get me wrong, SHEIN is great! I‚Äôve just had some issues with it. I‚Äôve ordered a couple things off of shein. The first package I ordered came like 3 days before it was supposed to, and I was really happy because I had found a reliable app! The second time I ordered some things, they came as they were supposed to, but were made of really bad material and easily broke. Not only, but one of the things I bought had been messed up. It was a present for my parent, a necklace, and it was damaged. The third time I ordered something was about late October of this year. The information on the app said that it would be here mid November, and I was okay with it, although I‚Äôd have to give someone a late birthday present. It‚Äôs nearly December and I‚Äôve written 3 issues to SHEIN, or at least tried to contact them about it. I don‚Äôt have my package, and I‚Äôm really upset because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get this package or not. 

    This is a good app for cheap things, but the delivery times are way off, either that or (no offense to SHEIN) a scam.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-30T09:39:51-07:00

The automatic robot is bull*hit it don‚Äôt even help you I‚Äôm done using shein and will no refer everyone I know to temu where u actually get your items and even in a timely manner I‚Äôve seen the shein representative respond to myself and others about how sorry they are if I have any problems please contact costumer service and create a ticket. That‚Äôs I joke I‚Äôve made a video to show u can‚Äôt create a ticket and they don‚Äôt have the live chat feature anymore either‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also seen all the fake reviews from fake costumers lol it‚Äôs really shein workers yall spam reviewing don‚Äôt listen to reviews the flood with good ones so u don‚Äôt see the real ones. No help whatsoever u think with all the recent rumors about this company they would step up their game but they took the way to contact them away that‚Äôs a shame I will start referring my friends and the world to temu with the video I‚Äôve made if I don‚Äôt get a refund for my order I never got,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-19T01:21:02-07:00
8727522348,MILLYROCKMILLZ,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1112140525,8.2.1,5,From a person who doesn‚Äôt online shop.,I love this website for buying clothes but the fact they have jewelry shoes accessories home decor and wigs that have great density color and life span i cannot help myself but to write a review. I normally only bulk shop at the malls but it‚Äôs so expensive and for my 21st birthday i decided to use Shein. Of course I was scared to get scammed or having things not coming in on time plus anxiety of not knowing if it will fit me considering my birthday was so close. I ordered 10+ items clothes jewelry shoes and even a metal crown that was absolutely gorgeous people thought it was custom made and i only paid 5 bucks! Not to mention it came a week earlier than the expected delivery date. This site will forever be my go to not only for the cheap prices but the EXPENSIVE look and comfortability in the clothes and other items especially shoes makes me feel safe to come back over and over. Never take this gem from us!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-31T12:08:11-07:00
7304995667,renarenarena13,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id467103525,7.5.7,5,Fave Place to Shop,"Originally I was hesitant to order from Shein because like most people I thought it would take months to receive my order (if it ever arrived) and the sizes would be too small. Boy was I wrong. After a close friend told me that she loved them, she recommended I give them a try. Her best advice to me was to look at the reviews and order the size based on what others said ‚Äúruns small‚Äù, ‚Äúruns big‚Äù, ‚Äúno stretch‚Äù, etc. A year later and I‚Äôve probably ordered close to 50 things. Some weren‚Äôt for me and I returned those easy enough but most stuff I‚Äôve been shocked at how good the quality is! Last 4 weddings I‚Äôve attended I‚Äôve worn dresses from Shein and I always get compliments every time. And it‚Äôs not just clothing, don‚Äôt skimp out on the home and kitchen section! I bought a bag resealed for $2 and I‚Äôm obsessed with it. If you‚Äôre thinking of ordering from Shein, do it! You will not regret it and I bet you‚Äôll become a fan just as fast as I did.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-06T07:30:08-07:00
