Facebook lost user ship when they started stripping away their users freedom, and started changing the way they interact with one another. Limiting audience view in the newsfeed. It‚Äôs pretty monotonous when you have over 20 or more friends and you see the same ten people every other post. Facebook started to do too much and it caused users to look to other Social Media Platforms but then Facebook got greedy and had to snipe out their competition just to keep from losing their #1 spot. When Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook years ago, he said he would not go in the way that Tom of ‚ÄòMySpace‚Äô went.

A whole group allows people to bully and call people white trash and the admins don‚Äôt do anything when you report it. That group should be shut down! Soul Food Foodies. I have reached out to them several times because a member kept harassing me and other members. That group needs to be shut down for allowing racism and bullying, everyday. I shouldn‚Äôt be muted because I called someone out for trolling me. That‚Äôs what a troll is. Not the monster, the person that randomly harassed people on the internet is called a troll. So unfair and you have no way to tell yourside if the story.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-12-21T04:02:29-07:00"},{"id":"10005495770","userName":"jdjdiskxjkc","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1180994962","version":"417.0","score":5,"title":"Dear Facebook Management and Mark Zuckerberg,","text":"Yeah sure, some users might‚Äôve gotten zucced in the past before for sharing something the FB bot algorithm got confused at but who cares???

As I did research I found that a lot of ppl have had this problem as well & get no answer.

Many of these are aimed at spammers. To me FACEBOOK is erring on the aggressive side of enforcing Its policies. Needless to say a reason, proof, or how to correct the problem should be implemented in the system so innocent people‚Äôs lives don‚Äôt come crashing down because of some FB BOT.

Then you have no recourse whatsoever. You cannot contact Facebook except through the app. Which if you‚Äôre locked out, you cannot do! They send an email telling you someone has changed your password. But they‚Äôve already let them in before you get the email. And then it‚Äôs too late. Then you are prompted to add two factor authentication and you do that thinking your giving yourself better protection. But then that two factor authentication keeps you out of your old account because you didn‚Äôt have it for that originally!  Phone calls to Facebook go unanswered and unreturned.

My mother‚Äôs account was disabled for a conduct violation, but she was given no information about the actual violation and after an attempted appeal process, with terrible customer support and minimal information provided, her account was permanently disabled. You cannot reach an actual person in this company. That‚Äôs a whole collection of memories, interactions and connections lost forever. Now she cannot even use any Facebook apps on her phone. This company is pathetic, and if they did not have the momentum of being a leading social network provider, or massive amounts of money to buy competitors, they would no longer exist.

How did I arrive to this opinion of you? Surely it couldn‚Äôt have anything to do with the 10 or so 30 day bans I‚Äôve gotten as a result of your over sensitive algorithms. Getting banned for things like a picture of Jeffrey Dahmer eating a burger with a caption that says ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt taste like it has 5 guys in it‚Äù or comments like ‚ÄúAmericans are incredibly selfish‚Äù. It seems myself, and the vast majority of your sites users are tired of your garbage. I can‚Äôt comment anything without your AI slapping me with a ban. I haven‚Äôt been able to keep my account active for more than a month at a time since the beginning of 2020 because you clowns hate freedom of speech so much. Funny, how a site that started as Zuck‚Äôs secondhand idea for rating how physically attractive (creepy by the way, very creepy) they think women are online without their consent, became what it is now.
