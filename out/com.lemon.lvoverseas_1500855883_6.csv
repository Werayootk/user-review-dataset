If you are 18+ you can apply to post edits idk much about that process cause I‚Äôm not over 18. With those videos/edits you can use them with your own pics. You can also just create your own edits with any sound,pics,filters,ect. It‚Äôs really easy to use though once you understand what‚Äôs what and how to use it. One thing is though the comment portion of notifications, I was a little confused at first I thought it was like where you have in app private convos with people im still confused with that so yeah that‚Äôs the only complaint.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-25T15:44:13-07:00

If you don‚Äôt put your card in so even tho people can still use your templates. I have had so much fun with this app and even made edits of myself. And right now I am working on one. So ye my suggestion was that you can still post even if your a bit young! I have been using this app for a while and it is really easy and helpful to use so if your reading this I suggest you use capcut if you want to edit it gives tutorials on how to edit so it will be easy but I really recommend trying it LOVE THE APP SO MUCH

Although I would say there needs to be more Versatility for shakes and text shakes, I would ask so recommended there is a section where we can import our own files of text fonts and shakes. Also I noticed the more I import and add effects the more the laggy the preview gets. And I understand that is normal. Although I think it‚Äôs a bit abnormal for how laggy it is. I can‚Äôt even get 1 second of it playing semi normally, because it freezes. 
To conclude, I give this app a 5/5 for beginners or people who just want to edit for fun.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Completely Free - Their is no premium no subscription no nothing. The only thing that costs money in this app is getting more MBs in the cloud.

‚Ä¢ Easy To Use - This app is the most easy editing app I have ever seen and it still has a lot of features. I was able to teach my self by just messing around.

‚Ä¢ Templates - Templates are really good if you are a beginner and just want to Make really cool videos.

‚Ä¢ Tutorials - Their are tutorials built in to this app for you to learn if you need it.

‚Ä¢ Editing Photos - If you don‚Äôt have a photo editing app this would be a great substitute for it.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Not on Windows,Or Mac - This isn‚Äôt really a big issue but I would love to see this in the future

‚Ä¢ Phone Dying Glitch - Their is this glitch where if your device dies while editing a video the video you were working will now be extremely laggy (Just the visuals) And it will be like this even when you export it. I don‚Äôt let my phone die while editing because of this so it may have been fixed but just in case it hasnt. I‚Äôm going to leave this here.

However, as time has gone by and new updates have been released, I have not been as satisfied with my experience as I once was. 
Now, when I finish an edit and export it, it becomes off-beat. I use the match cut feature to ensure that my clips align with the audio, and check it before I export, but somewhere in the export process the clips unaligned with the audio. Additionally, When I make an edit where I use a scene, I have to split the scene in order to format it. I make sure that I cut it in the right place, so that there isn't a split second of the camera switch before the next clip.

Absolutely worth my time. Making edits on this app is so fun and it never takes me too long. The no watermark really helps because I don‚Äôt want to waste money on an editing app just to remove something.  But I have suggestions to make this app even better even though you might not see this.
A- Fonts
  Now we have a lot of great fonts in this app, although I feel like we could use more Sans Serif or just Serif fonts to make it more regular but to really step it up. Frankly, you can use the different language fonts in English sentences, I feel like to make our editing jobs more modern we could use more round, and bubbly fonts. 

Example: Champagne & Limousines, Blacklisted, and etc.

B- Animation
    Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the animations on this app are everything. Even better than most transitional animations. However, I feel as though we need graphs to make our own video animations. Font animations are okay, but I feel like it‚Äôd be cooler to add the same animations for the fonts as the pictures have.

Another thing I hope could happen with this app is being able to save your speed effects things so for example when you click speed you have two options and if you click the second one you have graph type things and u would love to be able to save the speeds and points I use so that it cuts down on editing time.

So many things we are unable to use if we don‚Äôt pay a monthly or yearly fee. I do see CapCut becoming better with this, but yeah the only thing I ask is to add some new (and better) things. I would also enjoy a feature to where you can make a watermark for your videos, save it, and have like a little folder to just import it which would be SUPER helpful!

CapCut makes it easy to design whatever you need. I used it for free but I paid for a month and realized I enjoyed it so much that the yearly subscription was worth it for me. There‚Äôs so much available in the free version that, depending on what you‚Äôre using it for, you don‚Äôt have to buy it. 

There are tutorials and templates in case you get stuck or need help. I still feel as if I haven‚Äôt tapped into half of its potential.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-14T01:24:42-07:00

This app was a dream to use and was absolutely fantastic, then they added CapCut pro‚Ä¶.. the charm and the reason I wanted CapCut was because it was amazing and free, I understand they need money to run this, but CapCut pro was a mistake. I hate sounding like a Karen but this just ruined the charm and the factors that made CapCut amazing, it‚Äôs still a good editing app and there are still great free features, however; it‚Äôs no longer amazing. I don‚Äôt blame them for needing funds for the app, and I understand that they put in hard work and need to pay their employees, but CapCut is no longer a gem, it‚Äôs just another victim to capitalism. Still a good app, but it‚Äôs no longer a great app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-08T19:58:42-07:00
