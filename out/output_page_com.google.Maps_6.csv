I’m really frustrated by the latest update though. The new commute feature doesn’t do much in the way of convenience. My work hours vary and sometimes it doesn’t know if I’m headed home or to work- Hello? You’re a travel app, use the GPS? Plus, the commute screen has so much clutter on it that I can’t see the highlighted route clearly because it’s so small. I don’t want to have to hit “Start” and then zoom out/in in order to see the suggested route. 

Also, I really liked the old feature that showed locations from upcoming calendar events onscreen. For instance, if I opened the app at 4 and had a 4:30 doctor appointment, there was a shortcut to directions to the doctor. That seems to be gone now, which is really unfortunate.

Since the last update (October 2020) the app started having erratic behavior, inaccurate location, and in the worst cases it shows ghost roads that doesn’t exist. 

After I set a destination and a specific route, the app arbitrarily changes the route to an alternate one, while driving. That never happened before, the app used to respect the user decision to use one specific route. Also when I want to pan-zoom the map after a route has been set, the app start zooming in arbitrarily to my current location and it’s not allowing me to freely see the route surroundings without taking me back to my current location. Please note that most of the times this happens while the user is driving and cannot be distracted handling a stubborn app.

Yesterday I had to drive through an area with no cellular signal, so I set the route in advance. In the middle of nowhere the app arbitrarily changed the route to a ghost road that doesn’t exist (showed a freeway in the middle of the Cascades mountains in Washington State!). I ended up giving up and had to rely in the old fashion paper road map.

Leaving Monterrey, in the middle of the about two hour drive, Google Maps tells you to turn, luckily, there isn’t an exit nearby. 
If you’re traveling into Mexico from Laredo, shortly after entering the tollway, same Mexico 85, Goggle Maps, tells you to take an exit that takes you off the tollway and onto the service road or free highway, even if you’re have tollways turned on. 
Have you folks ever thought of adding tolls to the maps, so, if you’re traveling in Mexico, you know about how much you need in pesos?
That way, we could have our money ready when we get to the toll booth?
And last, there is normally one lane, exclusive for toll tags, it’s normally not marked very well.

I can’t constantly look at my phone to see the exit number and the navigation doesn’t say anything until the last second. There should be more notice before exits and turns because I’m constantly missing them when the navigation doesn’t say anything. Also what does stay left to turn right mean?

Maps and street views are updated regularly, the navigation is usually on point, routing you the quickest way through traffic, construction, accidents, etc. Lots of great features, many of which I probably haven’t discovered.

In my opinion, Google Maps for iOS has only one flaw. After updating, it doesn’t remember my route options (avoid highways, avoid tolls, etc.). I don’t like tollways but I have found myself on them more than once because I wasn’t aware Google Maps’ settings had changed back to the default.

Then it directed me to get BACK on the highway I had just exited (one of those highways that combines exit ramps with on-ramps then merges the ramps back onto the highway). Then it had me EXIT the highway taking an exit that was completely not the right exit, only to turn around on the overpass and get back ONTO the same highway going in the opposite direction. This was completely unnecessary and added miles to my trip. And in the middle of turning around on the overpass, it freaks out and re-calculates for no reason.

Then I had a hunch & decided to test it:  I paired a Bluetooth ear piece to my iPhone, then launched Google Maps.  Voila!!  I now hear the voice.  But why did I still give Google Maps just one star, you ask.

It turns out Google Maps quietly changed its app so that the voice can ONLY be heard via a Bluetooth device.  If you don’t have a Bluetooth device paired to your iPhone, you will never hear the voice, no matter what you do.  Without a Bluetooth, the voice is still there but it’s being sent into empty space where no one can hear it.

But if you go through the Google Maps app, I challenge anyone to show me where it states “users must activate a Bluetooth device in order to hear the navigation voice.  The voice will not be heard on your iPhone speaker.”

#1.  This is a bug:  users should have the option of hearing the voice on their iPhone speaker without a Bluetooth device

#2.  This is what I call extremely poor technical writing.  An app that’s worth the reputation of Google should at least inform users that its Maps app requires a Bluetooth device at all times when the app is running, especially if it never required one in past versions.

I had to re-enter my destination easily 15x on a walk last night. Also all my saved places now just show as coordinates. This is catastrophic level failure. Please fix! My other complaint is while using navigation, you give such little data on street names and other details that are helpful when driving. It is more distracting to have to zoom in with 2 hands on roads as far in as it will go because your developers don’t think it’s relevant to display street names during a drive. Lots of others users with some complaints. Don’t make us switch to Apple Maps guys…",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-26T10:46:48-07:00
