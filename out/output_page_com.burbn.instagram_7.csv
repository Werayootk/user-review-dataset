Now, the reason of the hypocrite part of the title, is because I mean it. I follow a lot of meme accounts and others who post people falling and that cheeze, but often they come up with their own off topic, what I mean with that, is that they post half naked girls, or them doing something weird (or inappropiate to a few, and offensive to girls themselves) same with boys, and then nothing happens to thise posts when they're actually against the Instagram rules.
And instead of warning tyem about it, you guys decide to almost delete an account for having non disgusting, offending, or inappropiate memes, and that's technically not fair to anyone. (eventhough I have seen some inappropiate related memes and y'all still don't do a thing).
I really couldn't care less for the updates or whatever you guys do to the app, but don't be hypocrites, and follow your own rules, and don't be so delicate with a few memes when there is way worse content for others.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-14T08:54:00-07:00

Forced dark mode is awful. It hurts my eyes and I can‚Äôt stand how it looks - to the point where I won‚Äôt spend time on the home page of the app. It makes the photos look terrible. What color are the walls in a museum or art gallery typically? White. Because it‚Äôs allows the art to take focus. I also hate the new full screen feature. It feels claustrophobic, and it‚Äôs frustrating to use. There‚Äôs so much junk on the screen! I also hate that I can‚Äôt mute a video by tapping the screen anymore since tapping the screen now pauses reels (just like on TikTok‚Ä¶ what do you know. üôÑ). You can‚Äôt even silence your phone to mute videos! You have to turn your volume all the way down, which messes with the volume of my ringtones and message alerts on my phone! This update is a mess.

This latest update has broken hashtags, which was one of the only ways for smaller creators to get their content out there. They've replaced all recent posts under hashtags to all recent top posts, meaning if you already don't have a decent following, your content is going to be pushed aside and not even be featured under said hashtags. It makes hashtags completely useless now, and it's even harder to get noticed as a small artist. I want to be able to make money off of my art work with commissions, but because hashtags have no use anymore, I'm not reaching any new users who may be interested in my art. This goes both ways, since I'm also not finding smaller accounts whom I may be interested in following. 

Instagram was originally about sharing photos, but it's become a weird Tik Tok hybrid trying to leech off of its success. It is disheartening and it feels like Instagram wants to further separate smaller creators from the larger ones. It's gotten to the point where I am seriously considering a different app altogether.

The original purpose of the application is completely lost. You tech-guys really live inside a bubble of your own farts. UPDATE: App has more glitches and annoyances than ever. Constantly showing me the same notifications for comments & likes that I have already seen multiple times. You messed it up, Facebook LLC. Ruined the app completely. Was that your goal? Good job, you did it.

Newer comments are so scattered and difficult to find on a post that there‚Äôs no sense revisiting a post anymore, so I‚Äôve spent drastically less time on the app since the latest update. Also, it‚Äôs a worrisome feeling writing a comment and having no idea where Instagram is going to plop it in the order and for what reason. You have no idea if people are reading your comment or if it‚Äôs too far low on the page. Some of the kindest and most encouraging comments from people are towards the bottom of the pile, seemingly because they‚Äôre several sentences long, or because they don‚Äôt have mutual friends with the original poster. The uncertainty of why the faulty algorithm favors certain commenters over others has given me anxiety I‚Äôve never suffered from before, on an app that was originally supposed to be fun and a stress reliever. Now it‚Äôs the complete opposite. A computer algorithm can‚Äôt determine a person‚Äôs worth or the quality of their comment. I‚Äôd rather just watch TV than worry about this anymore.

It's still intsgram, and it's still heavily loved. I want to be honest, and that's why I've still rated it 5 stars. 

I'm writing this review, however, to express my hatred and frustration toward these terrible updates. Instagram keep changing the layout of the app, and it's annoying, upsetting, and most of all, confusing. Part of all the changes around the layout has been promoting Instagram's new feature. 'Reals', an obvious clone of Tik Toks, are unnecessary. They take up too much space. But what's so bothersome about this feature is the movement of the notification and create post buttons. Both of these have been moved to the home page and replaced with reels and shop. It incredibly annoying to constantly be accidentally clicking on something due to the muscle memory that frequent users have developed.

Please just change things back to how they were. If you'd like to keep reels, move them to the homepage instead.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-16T19:50:32-07:00

The majority of Instagram users created their account to simply connect with friends and access content like news, sports or memes posted by popular pages. Now it feels like my social media account is part of some online shopping website, which is absolutely not what I wanted.

But now it‚Äôs so blatant that Instagram only cares about money and selling products or promoting business, which is not what social media was created for. So many apps are created for the communities benefit and solely based on giving them the best experience for them to enjoy... but eventually they just use their popularity to create more revenue and destroy the true unique user experience that made it so popular to begin with. I really hope they revert to the older format... probably not thought",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-17T17:13:43-07:00

It, an‚Äù ACTION BLOCKED‚Äù!!‚ö†Ô∏è one day I woke up and my friend just followed me on that morning so I was delighted to see her at my follower's list and so I tried to follow her back. I've got this message, again and again, day after day week after week and so I tried to report this problem again but never got a response!? I beg you ‚Äùinstagram‚Äù to help me solve this problem, I would really appreciate you taking the time to respond back and solve this issue. I fully understand the importance of Instagram privacy and security and if I have made a mistake or have disobeyed the Instagram policy I would like to to know and what I can do to resolve this problem. I believe that everyone deserves to follow friends, family or someone we look up to on a platform that connects us together.

Y‚Äôall were on point with the updates for a good minute but now they have become a hot booty mess! It all began when y‚Äôall changed the timeline from going in chronological order to just a random order of the pages you like most or look at the most. Idk exactly how to explain it but i hate it! I constantly miss out on things people have posted and they pop up on my feed and says posted 2 days ago like who tf wants to see that stuff now. And now we have an even bigger problem y‚Äôall done goofed and changed the timeline to tapping. Insta i just wanna talk for a second nie phone to phone... the stories ONLY, were made for tapping and the big hype about insta was scrolling. Shoot y‚Äôall already copied snap with the stories so the least y‚Äôall could do was stay consistent with the scrolling feed. Y‚ÄôALL HAD ONLY ONE JOB!!! I just wanna say all of your users hate this wack behind update including myself. Please do better or insta will be getting left in 2018 and it‚Äôs #Twitter2k19. Btw great way to end a year for yourself! Y‚Äôall sure know how to ruin stuff. Moral of this whole dang story just change everything back to normal including how the timeline works. Please and thanks.

------
I remember when people posted quality content on Instagram. Then came the age of the selfies, and now it's the memes. That's all I see on the explore page. Not a fan. I'd like a filter so I can choose quality posts. I also get at least 5 request a day for followers from accounts that display pornography or are lewd in other aspects. How about adding a filter as to what can be posted in the bio section? If keywords are caught, the account can't be created. I put my account on private just so I don't have these types of followers. I'm not a prude but I have an image to keep and don't want these types of followers. There's also a high rate of stealing others pictures. I would love if there was a feature that automatically added a watermark (or logo) somewhere on the post with the account name so if anyone steals it, there is evidence where it came from (See the app: VOUN as they do a signature option). I hate that the posts are out of order now. It makes no sense. If I wanted to see someone's specific post, I'll go to their account. I don't need them to appear on the top because they posted something once or twice that I liked. Now I miss half of the posts. I even stopped liking posts so posts don't appear out of order.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2018-04-18T09:43:41-07:00

I‚Äôm tired of Instagram trying to shove new content in my face on my feed and showing me less of people I actually follow. I actively use reels and the explore page, but lately new accounts I don‚Äôt follow pop up in my feed as ‚Äòsuggested‚Äô and most of the time it‚Äôs content that‚Äôs not my style and I find annoying, so I use the feature to ‚Äòsuggest less like this.‚Äô This morning I got the same thing, but this time there wasn‚Äôt a feature to say I dislike it. No thanks, I‚Äôll just take a break and delete the app until they fix it, or I‚Äôll just stop using entirely. 

Older review:
The new format just removed the remaining good parts of Instagram, now I just get instantly annoyed once I open it. Gonna delete off my phone to save myself a headache. Update: it‚Äôs been maybe three weeks and the IG on my iPad finally went back to normal so I decided to redownload on my phone - still terrible. I hate the scroll jump and that videos don‚Äôt have the mute button so I deleted it again. My friends haven‚Äôt had their account change to the new format yet and they don‚Äôt want it to. Hopefully the IG team accepts this loss and focuses their efforts on upgrades that‚Äôll actually be wanted from users.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-15T08:35:33-07:00
9112627352,es oh es,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id898432430,253.0,1,Not properly removing racist comments,Somehow Instagram just seems to keep getting worse? I‚Äôve been using instgram for several years now. Recently I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of racist comments and I‚Äôve been reporting them however there is no category for racism. So I put it under bullying/harassment. Few days later I get a review saying that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the comments and that they can‚Äôt remove them. Which is awful. Instagram claims to want to be a safe environment for everyone. And yet they seem to condone racism especially toward Asian people! They also began to remove my comments that i left for a sex bot on a meme page comment section. Not even 5 seconds after commenting my joke Instagram sent a message saying that my comment was bullying and harassment(it was not at all). Instagram please remove actually problematic racist comments rather than protecting your sex bots. Also you allow accounts to post actual videos of violence but threaten to remove my account for leaving ‚Äúsomeone plz punch him fr fr‚Äù which isn‚Äôt even that severe and I‚Äôve seen much worse that was toward Asian people that has been deemed ‚Äúnot against community guidelines‚Äù. And the video was about a guy cheating on his gf and showing no remorse. Y‚Äôall are honestly awful.

About 3 months ago my Instagram account was hacked by people on YOUR platform. I have gone to the Help Center online and have followed the instructions to submit a request form but EVERY TIME i click on ‚ÄúTry Another Way‚Äù it just prompts me back to the Help Center. It takes me in circles and it‚Äôs frustrating . I have filled out the form online about how you can better your Login, but I have had zero response. I have waited patiently for someone to hopefully get back to me. However, I am starting to grow impatient because whoever hacked my account is ACTIVELY still impersonating me. They continue to reach out to MY followers in order to scam them. I really hope you guys do something about this because it is happening on your platform. I know countless people who have been hacked and have no way of contacting you guys. I wish there was someone from Instagram who could please help me. I am growing desperate and the fact that someone has had access to my account for this long is really starting to scare me. Please Instagram Team i ask for your help. Thankyou for reading this and i hope you guys have a wonderful day!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-29T15:55:21-07:00

For some reason there‚Äôs a store now? Don‚Äôt see why that was necessary. The ads are shoveled down your throat, not to mention that Instagram blatantly takes information from you to give you ads on what you might want. They aren‚Äôt even trying to hide it anymore, you can google an item you may be interested in and sure enough it‚Äôll be an ad in your feed minutes later. Not to mention the app listens to you talk to give you ads, anyone can try this, just talk about something with the app open and watch it appear as an ad. You might think I‚Äôm joking but many many times of my personal experience would beg to differ. Plenty of censorship on the app too, ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù they call them. Typically they just put it on posts that are controversial rather than things that can easily be proven true or false. Oh if you mention anywhere on your post about the virus it puts a tab link to information about it. I could look past the fact checkers and all that but the ads are really what get me, wayyy too many and wayyy too personal.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-04T15:44:06-07:00

However, the app is constantly and randomly blocking my actions so I can‚Äôt use it properly. This is especially frustrating because there seems to be no real Instagram Support that you can reach. You can report problems, but I‚Äôve never had a response from Instagram when I report an issue. I appreciate and enjoy the app but I hate that I can‚Äôt use it half of the time for no reason at all. The constant and random blocking doesn‚Äôt just happen to me, it happens to my friends and family, too! Makes me want to delete the app altogether because I can‚Äôt use it most of the time anyway. And there are ‚Äúindependent fact checkers‚Äù on the app that label the truth as misinformation and then they censor posts entirely to block you from reading the information. Even if the information IS false, I should be able to read it and make that decision myself! I don‚Äôt need an ‚Äúindependent fact checker‚Äù to ‚Äúresearch‚Äù (aka provide one article from a non-credible source) and think for me! I really wish there was any alternative. As soon as an alternative becomes available to me, I will definitely switch over because I‚Äôm fed up with the information-censoring and horrible ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù at Instagram.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-12T18:01:41-07:00

You need to haunt this experiment or take away EVERYBODYS ability to see likes but you can‚Äôt do that cause you know all the backlash you‚Äôre going to get but if you just do it to people that don‚Äôt have a voice themselves you can‚Äôt get away with anything and hurt all these people‚Äôs mental health.
