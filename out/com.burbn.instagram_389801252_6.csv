But the transphobia under just about every Trans woman content creator is overwhelmingly. It really seems like this app is a gathering place for people to collectively call trans women men. So for these reasons I strongly discourage any trans women from using or joining the app‚Ä¶,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T06:12:02-07:00
11058110674,spinifexOl,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id561221459,322.1.0,1,Unexpected Volume Control Issue with Reels,"As an avid user of your platform, I've encountered a persistent and vexing issue that I feel compelled to bring to your attention. I've noticed that whenever I preemptively lower my phone's volume to avoid the jarring experience of a loud/annoying reel, the Instagram app appears to override my settings by automatically increasing the volume whenever a reel is played. This not only disrupts my user experience but also causes considerable inconvenience as I scramble to adjust the volume back to a comfortable level.

This bug, or perhaps an unintended feature, consistently manifests each time I engage with Reels, leading to an erratic and unsatisfactory experience. As someone who enjoys browsing content on Instagram, it's disheartening to see such a fundamental aspect of user control being overlooked.

I believe that an app of Instagram's caliber should empower its users with full control over their device settings, including audio preferences. Reels should respect the volume levels set by the user, rather than altering them without consent. This would not only enhance the user experience but also adhere to the expected behavior of respecting individual preferences.

I urge the development team to address this issue with urgency. By doing so, you will not only rectify a significant flaw but also reinforce the trust and satisfaction of your user base. Thank you for considering this feedback, and I look forward to a resolution that allows for a more enjoyable and controlled browsing experience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T05:57:51-07:00
