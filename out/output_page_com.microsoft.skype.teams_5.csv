Forget about the weird design choices that Microsoft seems to make for Apple apps.

When I join a meeting and go to another app, when you come back to Teams, it has always dropped the meeting and you have to rejoin (audio phone connection remains connected). Yammer seems to have the same issue with backgrounding the app.

There is no way to clear recent phone numbers for the ‚ÄúCall me by Phone‚Äù option, nor is there a way to have the app automatically call you at a specific phone number by default.

It seems impossible to get full screen on screenshare. Through a series of taps, you can select a view called ‚ÄúFocus on Content‚Äù, but it still never goes full screen. Maddening.
