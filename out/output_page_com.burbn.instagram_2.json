However I don’t know if this is a fluke or apart of the update. A message came up saying Instagram limits how much likes we can do on comments at a time to stop bullying... I just want to know who thought this was a good idea. This is a social media app that’s like the whole point, liking is literally the foundation of every media. If you have a limit whether your intentions are bad or not your going to end up being wiped for existence. And also I don’t know who thought a limit on liking comments would prevent bullying but that person has obviously never really been bullied in their entire life because that does nothing. The only thing limiting likes is going to do is leave Instagram with bad rating and have your audience delete the app and go to another platform that allows them to do what social media is suppose to be able to do. Speaking of such I won’t delete the app yet because I’m hoping this is a fluke but I will be switching to another platform, for the rest of the month, that is able to do its job. I appreciate the concern for bullying but find a way to help prevent it that doesn’t effect everyone and take away from the purpose of social media.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-26T10:23:40-07:00"},{"id":"3738007240","userName":"lit_lana","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id538675515","version":"79.0","score":1,"title":"Is instagram deleting people for doing nothing?","text":"Overall I love the app instagram, you can see funny videos and even gain followers on there, but here is the biggest problem on instagram, THEY ARE DELETING ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOTHING WRONG. Instagram needs to get out of their brain dead state and start checking accounts before deleting them because they are getting reported and accounts are being banned and disabled. This is especially unfair to the fan editors out there. There are hundreds of thousands of people who make edits of their favorite people on apps such as TikTok, Instagram, etc. These fans work hard on their edits, tag the people they edited, try to make their day by showing how much they love them just so instagram can delete the photos and videos because they assume that they are trying to be them??? Clearly if you read the caption you can clearly see that they are just simply showing how much they love that user. They are not trying to be like them they are just trying to support them. If they think people who show love to who they support then why don’t hate pages get banned, reported, or disabled? This isn’t the only people instagram has done this to because a nice dancer who did absolutely nothing wrong got disabled at 300k, the followers she worked hard on getting!!! Instagram needs to step up their game and stop doing all this bad stuff to these people who show their support or I’ll just have to be one of the many people who delete this app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-02-05T19:05:57-07:00"},{"id":"10465922115","userName":"2015$@&crap","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id452314813","version":"304.0","score":1,"title":"Glitch","text":"I’ve had 6 comments removed for supposedly breaking guidelines none of them did. simply opinions that have everything to do with the topic posted.

For example, the comments are not in chronological order;making them very confusing. I have found a similar problem in the feed algorithm. They are not in chronological order anymore. You will see a post from 2 weeks ago, and then a post from 2 DAYS ago. Next, there should be a bigger time frame for videos. You cab only have a video that is 1 minute long. I wanted to post a slime review, but the video was 2 minutes long so I had to do it in 2 separate videos even though all of the slimes came together. Finally, I think you should fix the messages.

I come on Instagram to see original photos, not to see some idiot making the same video that 700,000 other idiots have already made. Lip-syncing over someone else’s audio. Without original content, the app is no fun anymore. I also can’t even log in one day without being tagged in some spammer's scam nonsense. Then add on top of all that, Instagram continuously violates its guidelines. Their guidelines state “We also remove content that attempts to trade, coordinate the trade of, donate, gift, or ask for non-medical drugs, as well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical drugs.” Yet nearly every day I get random posts, from people I don’t follow, of them using or admitting to the use of federally illegal schedule one narcotics. When I report them I’m told that Instagram isn’t even going to look at the posts because they get too many reports to review them all. My children are on this app, and I’m going to have to block it from their screen time now because Instagram refuses to enforce its guidelines.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-08T11:55:05-07:00"},{"id":"8205958647","userName":"C.arlene_15","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1274751575","version":"216.0","score":1,"title":"Is it just me","text":"Truly I despise this app. I know for a fact I used to have an addiction to it.

Then this new update replaced the notification and post tabs with reels and shop, which seriously effects it's usability. Now my notifications and post buttons are in an awkward hard to reach spot, instead of being easily accessible. Everyone I've asked have agreed that this new update is terrible, and that NO ONE cares or asked to have a whole shopping section on a photo sharing platform. This update feels like Instagram is desperately trying to pull users from other apps like TikTok and Pinterest instead of focusing on its own user base and their wants. I am so incredibly disappointed in Instagram's team for consistently refusing to acknowledge their user's concerns.

There are 2 dozen other photo apps in the iOS store at present with more features, better integration, faster processing & less battery drain than what you can find with Instagram. iPhone’s photo editing tools are so much superior to IG that it sort of baffles me why anyone with a modern handset would want to use those features. Even though I only ever perused this app for maybe 5 minutes per week by the time I cancelled, its battery consumption was routinely in the top 10, per the phone’s metrics. In fact, upon a quick check now, I see that despite deleting the app early this week, it *still* managed to book a 2% consumption of my weekly battery usage, which I’m sorry, but that blows me away. \n\nWhat on earth was this app doing to my handset in the background?!

Not only did the downfall begin with reels, this also attacked small creators because the only way for people to see your posts & get some follower traction is through making a reel… which is also ridiculous because the app was never geared towards that before. Not only this, but the recent posts option was removed from hashtags so now it’s basically impossible for anyone to see new content in the hashtags, all you have to rely on now is whatever following you have, which is idiotic because only half of your followers actually see your post, and of that amount only half actually interact. This is ridiculous, how is anyone supposed to enjoy this app? Why is this the “most efficient” way for the app to run now?

The previously existing top posts tag already held new top posts. Not only does this hurt small creators and account by severely limiting their capability of getting interactions when they post, this also causes other problems. For example: I wanted to look at the photos posted on a wedding tag recently. I could see some of them, from a few accounts that posted, but what if I wanted to see everything? I couldn’t access a way to see all of the posts, only the most popular ones. I sure hope this is a beta test, and that Instagram will strongly consider rolling back this change.

For the past couple of months, I have been unable to create promotions (it says something along the lines of “something went wrong on our end, please try again later”) unless I delete the app, redownload it, then create a promotion within 5 minutes of redownloading it (it has the old Instagram appearance with the notification section on the bottom bar when I redownload it, then changes back to the new layout with problems after about 5 minutes). Then when I get to make one using the above method, I can’t edit it or stop it if it’s not performing properly (which they aren’t anymore). I also cannot edit payment methods (same error message). My reach outside of direct marketing has also plummeted (videos that were consistently getting 4k+ views in less than an hour are now lucky to get over 300 in their lifetime). No matter how many times I report issues, nothing is resolved, and I can’t find any answers online or speak with a customer support agent (which is INSANE for any service that accepts money).

If you would’ve asked me a little over a week ago I would’ve said, “ I love Instagram it’s the best social media app out there!” But , within this lovely week-ish. I’ve had my business account completely deleted with no explanation. Let’s add that it was AFTER I paid for a Instagram promotion and finished it. So they took my money, then deleted my account. I didn’t post anything more from the post that I put through promotion, just took the money and deleted it. And now after giving up on having my business go through Instagram I find today that I’ve also been logged out of my personal account, not deleted yet, but the account that I’ve had since I was in 6th grade. The account will not let me log in since I had an account that got blocked on this phone. So now I’m off of both business and personal accounts and being forced by Instagram to take an ig hiatus. I don’t understand why Instagram is targeting certain accounts through their apps, especially account holders that are physically paying them. So, please take a second to think about weather it’s worth it to run a business through Instagram with having the chance for it to be deleted with no exploration and no support from Instagram since none of their support outlets either connect you with someone or even work for what they say they do.

After Twitter started becoming more ads than feed, I started using it less and less and dropped it entirely after the whole X debacle, so Instagram became my primary social media. I stuck around happily, even after the platform started going down the same path of greed as X. I stuck around still, despite the suggested and sponsored posts becoming more intrusive and less relevant to my interests. However, the implementation of only allowing “Top recent posts” has killed any interest I had in the app. I used to scroll through my favorite tags and find new posts, often sharing them with my friends. Now, though, it only shows a handful of posts that already have likes and engagement, making it impossible to find up-and-coming creators on the app. Even more frustrating, in the past few weeks, my business account has been disabled multiple times for “suspicious activity,” despite having no signs of said suspicious activity (I am not violating ToS, I do not use any third party apps, my account is not leaving multiple likes or comments on other posts, and my business deals in education- the only reason I can find for this to keep happening is because of a bug that occurs when you use Instagram on desktop).

Whenever your story would disappear after the 24 hours ended, you’d get a notification saying how many people viewed it. Now, that’s not there anymore, and I have to go to my archived just to see who looked at my stories.\n Another thing is the hashtag following (or whatever it is 🤷‍♀️). For me personally, I’ve never used this. I tried it once and just thought it was annoying cause the posts would go on my feed, and I’d be thinking that I’m just following these accounts when I wasn’t. It really isn’t the greatest feature to me, as I could just go to my explore page and find the same posts.\nRegardless of these minor things though, I still use Instagram pretty much every day. 😂 It’d just be nicer if these issues were resolved or taken into account by me writing this.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-12-21T08:07:25-07:00"},{"id":"7902631767","userName":"Rosifart","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id601302922","version":"208.0","score":1,"title":"Why would you make it like this?","text":"So usually I’d give Instagram 5 stars but considering that my account was disabled for the dumbest reasons I refuse to give it 5 stars.
