I submitted a report to the app, got an email saying I’d receive a reply within a few days, and never heard back. \nI think there’s a fundamental flaw in the business plan.

Moreover, restaurants tend to be hit or miss, so please let people leave written reviews to describe what they received. \n\nLastly, I don’t believe the app is always being used for the intended purpose by all restaurants. It seems like some restaurants aren’t using it to get rid of inventory that needs to be baked fresh daily but rather to increase sales at end of day. \n\nI was unpleasantly surprised when a bakery only gave me 5 cream puffs out of the 30 or so left at closing.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-28T12:35:47-07:00"},{"id":"6996189320","userName":"PeeRolly","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id861576405","version":"21.1.1","score":3,"title":"“Order Completed” Should Be Endorsed by Customer","text":"TGTG staff aren’t on ground to confirm if order has been picked up or not.
