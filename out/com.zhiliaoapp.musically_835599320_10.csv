There is a HUGE community of Adults on TikTok, and we are all able to have FUN and express ourselves in a way that can be silly, serious, goofy, or ANYWAY that you want. There is the ""for you"" page that allows you to browse through various broadcasters. To build the type of content you would like to continue seeing, you simply press the heart icon on the right hand side of the page. After a while TikTok will only show you the type of content that interests you based on your previous likes.  If you want to continue to see content from a particular person, simply press the plus sign on the right side of the page. This user will now show up on your ""following"" page ( located on the top left of your TikTok main page). This application can be VERY therapeutic for those of you that would like to create content. It allows you to express yourself in anyway that you want. I recommend this app 100% for boomers, Gen-X, Millennials, and ANYONE else who feels they might be too old for this app!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-23T11:49:58-07:00

This caused me to delete the app, while I have some good memories of this app, I have flashbacks and memories about what those people said and now I cannot forget, it‚Äôs ruining me. For the people that this is happening to, delete the app immediately because once someone starts harassing you it‚Äôs almost impossible to forget well, for me anyway. I can‚Äôt even read a comic or look some of my favorite things in the world, DC and marvel, I can‚Äôt even look at a character without having some horrid memories of what they said. Long story short, I used to love the app but now. It tore me apart and took some of the best parts of me. I‚Äôve also had to push myself away from comics for a while. Due to this.

Along with seeing a lot of accounts helping there followers. For example, A few people FaceTime followers (if both participants want to) and they have a meal together whether the reason is you don‚Äôt want to be alone or you feel weird eating without someone. also people spreading awareness about mental health and different psychological disorders. 
I‚Äôve also learned a lot about safety. How to protect myself from dangerous situations, learning about kidnappings, learning self defense, there are also many recordings people made so if you are being followed or in an uber it‚Äôs sounds like you are on faceTime with a friend and they know your location.

But, i have sadly realized something. Most of the videos on the foryou page are celebrities, OR old videos with thousands of likes that still appear multiple times on my Foryou page. So i suggest that people who has like -100 followers should get more on the foryou page. They deserve the chance, even if they have -100 fans/followers, that doesn't mean they don't work hard on their Tiktok, they do. And maybe they are proud of them. I assure you when they film Tiktoks, they probably wish they can be like all of those influencers, go viral, be famous, but they don't get the chance to do it or at least get on the Foryou page. It's not always about Charli and the Hype House. It shouldn't be like that. One more thing, i think the number of likes on a video should get hidden but not for the creator, because when a Tiktok with like 80-90 likes get on the foryou page, the people who sees it will not like it EVEN if the content is original and they like it. Trust me, i assure you it is like that.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-17T08:55:43-07:00

You want to know what the best vacuum to buy at a specific price point, TikTok will have a ton of creators that give you a quick rundown on which one they love and why along with a demo of course.

Many people join the app daily and so many videos uploaded on the hour is insane. It brings joy to people that are sad, occupies the bored, and brings joy to the world. But tik tok has really slipped with its guidelines lately. The amount of abuse to get famous is so ridiculous. There is bad stuff such as nudity and unapproved showing of it as well from other people.  There is too much of showing off of their body to get 10k likes on a post. It‚Äôs so dumb to do this. Not to mention many young kids look at these videos too and they see older teenagers doing it; so they assume it‚Äôs the right thing to do so they start doing stuff. It‚Äôs influencing the younger kids to do bad things. Also, I am pretty sure that if some parents saw what kids were doing on this app, I garuntee that many parents would be upset with many of the videos posted. Once again tik tok is a great app to socialize and see people around the world and see what they are doing. But the guidelines have slipped away and now kids that are underage of 18 are allowed to post videos of them showing off their body and it bring allowed to be on the for you page.

I have a couple more things to say. In my opinion and probably many others to we don‚Äôt enjoy this new update at all. The way everything is laid out is really different, I am not the biggest fan of it.

PLEASE CHANGE THIS OR OTHERS AND MYSELF WILL BE FORCED TO STOP MAKING VIDEOS. another problem that isnt as bothersome but still is inconvenient is how they add filters automatically when you try to use the sound. why would you think this would be helpful ? if i wanted to use the filter i would have favorited it, but i didnt. i never once wanted to use the freckle filter or the blue eyed ones but somehow they get added to almost every one of my videos. so many videos of mine have been ruined because of a filter that was on there unknowingly. sometimes im able to just rerecord (which is still a pain) but many times it was a one time only video that i cant rerecord. in the end im stuck with this annoying filter that i never wanted there in the first place.

Sometimes I had seen videos where accounts help with tips for gender for example puberty tips, etc. How ever people hate and start making men/woman uncomfortable with the comments they make on the video. So if a video is for men, only show the video to that gender, if it‚Äôs for a woman, do the same.

I can‚Äôt even save my footage because it crashes when I go to review it, and in order to use the rest of the app I have to delete the footage. Which I spent a lot of time collecting. And have no other copy since I recorded it in your app. And no way to get it back. Since like I said, it crashes when I go to review it. I thought I atleast would have gotten some sort of response but I got none. This app is awe full and it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôve been ignored.

And honestly by looking at the other low rating comments. Your never gonna see this cause you probably don‚Äôt bother to look. Which is why nothing ever gets fixed on your app. People put their problems in five star reviews and they never get read since they are five stars. And the one stars never get read since it‚Äôs mostly just people saying they hate the app. Well I‚Äôm beginning to understand why. It‚Äôs hard to enjoy an app that actively stops you from enjoying it.

And obviously there are a million other problems. But right now this is what I care about, so until this gets fixed your staying at two stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-19T22:33:20-07:00

Many people have complained that they have spent 13 or even more hours a day on this app.  People could be using this time to socialize, sleep, eat etc. but instead use it for rubbing a piece of plastic FOR HOURS.

I‚Äôm very disappointed in TikTok right now. When setting up a profile, don‚Äôt you have to put in your age, and then TikTok tracks it. My video was taken down for ‚Äònudity and sexual exploitation of a minor‚Äô, but one: I turned 18 a while ago, so there should be no reason why I‚Äôm called a minor. And two: my video had nothing that violated the guidelines. In fact, I had already read all of them, and kept them in mind while filming.
Note this: during my time on this app, I have seen thousands of videos of minors who HAVE violated guidelines, but I don‚Äôt see those videos getting removed. So is this a biased thing that‚Äôs happening? Because I follow people who try to educate others about certain niches, and their video gets taken down and they get shadow banned for no reason.
If this is an app that truly supports everyone, then you would be more on top of your algorithm, and remove the videos that are actually not okay. I really was starting to like TikTok, and I want to use it more often, but if this is going to keep happening, then why even keep the app.

They make references to racism, suicide, and stuff like that while laughing and making jokes about them. I have tried reporting  multiple accounts like this, but they never get suspended or banned.

7458188487,c har c har,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1148928017,19.6.0,5,My Opinion,"I think tiktok should have an update where you can make group chats and everyone has to follow everyone or your not alowed in the group chat. I also think that the group chats could or could not be privite for Example you can chat with friends in the group chat and everyone can see it on your page but you can also make it privite and no one can see it on your page, there would be a small button on your page that says ‚Äúgroups‚Äú and you press it to see what groups you are in and others are in, if you make your groups privite the button will say ‚Äúthis user has thier groups priviet‚Äú or just say ‚Äúgroups privite‚Äú also if the user wants to keep thier groups public and want a Certain group privite you can go to group settings and pick 1-4 groups to have privite, i also think there should be only up to 10 groups aloud. Thats what I think tiktok should add, but if you dont its fine too. Thats my opinion but over all i think tiktok is an great, fun, and addicting app and every one on the app is great! sincerely Charlize rooney",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-12T18:37:56-07:00

I love tiktok, it gives me so much memories from my childhood. But here‚Äôs the thing. Community Guidelines, they are so unfair! If I post a video with cuss words it gives me a warning and takes it down. But tiktok guidelines don‚Äôt see that there‚Äôs women twerking half naked and they‚Äôre videos stay up. I saw a guy yesterday who wasnt wearing anything and was just covering his private part with a FOLDED TOWEL. and tiktok keeps that up? Just because it got over 50k likes, it gets to stay up. I‚Äôm not famous, but if i get 20 likes i would be proud. So tiktok, please make sure you take down the RIGHT videos. Not to mention, 4 OF MY ACCOUNTS GOT BANNED ON THE SAME WEEK! It started with my private account ‚Äúfor too many community guidelines error‚Äù Well im sorry that you don‚Äôt have a sense of humour of me making a small little joke (which i put a warning for people who are sensitive about taht topic) I wasn‚Äôt even being mean! This was on sunday. And today, 3 of my accounts got banned and i got locked

i‚Äôm going to get really mad because i didn‚Äôt do anything bad, it was just one account where i did liek 3 bad things but I never harrassed anyone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-31T02:57:13-07:00

Because tik tok is typically to late to ban them before kids find it. There is many disgusting trends or people on this app and TikTok is almost always too late to ban these things before little kids finding them. Little kids use this app. I know of literal  5 year olds having the app. And Tik tok to be completely honest is NOT a kids app. Many heavy topics are discussed on it or things like that. But there is things on the app that are for kids or just generally entertaining things that kids might watch but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have such easy access to bad things because there is just so much to the point you could see it without even searching Something remotely close to it. What I‚Äôm saying is that You TIKTok needs better restrictions,needs to ban bad accounts/videos as soon as possible, and maybe even make the app 13+. (I am also 12 but I just want to say that this app is such easy access to horrible things and even child predators)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-10T18:03:39-07:00

There this video where this woman showing her boobs to her son and starting to breastfeeding him. The comments was soo terrible that people has no life or other things to do. When someone else duet that video, they get perma-ban. There‚Äôs also animal pornography that I reported, those staff didn‚Äôt take it down and made a ‚Äúno violation‚Äù excuses. And let me get started about kids on live. They are kids on live doing this 'saying [word] [numbers] times' and they‚Äôre scamming people money because they‚Äôre mom can‚Äôt do nothing about it. I reported the live because the user was a kid, and the staffs did nothing about it and gave me ‚Äúno violation.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the worst part. When they do inappropriate prank or doing something inappropriate, that doesn‚Äôt get taken down, it just stay there until they delete their account. This app said family friendly but it‚Äôs actually not. If tiktok was going to accept something inappropriate, they could have add 17+ to the age entry. For your safety and not to waste your time, Instagram is way better media than tiktok and I highly suggest that you use Instagram instead of tiktok. Whatever you do on tiktok, find some evidence that tiktok is breaking, find a lawyer and sue tiktok.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-03T19:12:36-07:00

We have helped people eat when they feel there not deserving. We have helped people get out of bed. We have helped people not have to sleep on the streets or simply just given them some happiness and confidence. We have given room tips and morning tips and workouts and ways to make your confidence go up I‚Äôm talking to you spencer. How‚Äôs your bf doing lol. We have become so invested in relationships. Helped people through loosing a pet. We make cute dances and uplift creators. Like this app is just so amazing now. I have a style and a cute room. I‚Äôve learned some simple makeup and my confidence has gone up sooooo much from this app. It makes me so happy when people make vids saying ‚Äúyou are amazing‚Äù and just uplifting strangers. I love seeing someone sit down and eat a meal and strangers comments saying ‚Äú thank you for that I actually ate a meal today‚Äù like my heart is just so happy with this. We pay for helping with pets surgeries. We spread awareness about big issues like BLM and r@pe and so many other things. I come on Tik Tok to calm down after a bad day.

There are dances you can learn, tutorials on things like led light colors, cleaning things out of carpetsüíÄüíÄ and many more! There are so many sides of tiktok too! For example, there is straight tiktok. This is where all of the dancing, slime, povs, and main stuff happens. Alt tiktok is where you get a mix of deep/creepy/funny videos and straight tiktok videos. Deep tiktok is the deepest side of tiktok that is very hard to get to. This is where all of the dark memes and vibes happen. I am on deep tiktok because there is absolutely no drama, no political comments, and all in all it‚Äôs a straight up vibe. There is theatre tiktok, Barbie tiktok, broccoli tiktok, and so many other sides. It‚Äôs actually insane how many sides of tiktok I have been on! You can add videos to favorites, hold down on the video and select not interested if you don‚Äôt like a video, and there are settings to manage your account. You can change videos to private or friends only so you can choose who sees the video or not.
