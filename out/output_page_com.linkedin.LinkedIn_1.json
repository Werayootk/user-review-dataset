I can‚Äôt tell you how many are marked as remote when they‚Äôre actually hybrid and the actual location is nowhere near the posted location. \n\nI also find the cost of their Premium service to be way too expensive for the limited benefit you receive from it. They have also made it to where you cannot cancel from the app or your cellphone‚Äôs browser. You have to cancel from a desktop computer browser. What if you are someone who has lost their job, doesn‚Äôt have a personal computer at home, can‚Äôt afford the $40+/month, and you can‚Äôt cancel the subscription from your phone? I think a complaint to the BBB is in order.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-16T09:10:20-07:00"},{"id":"8615304611","userName":"AppUserrrrrr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id809355539","version":"9.1.266","score":1,"title":"NOT for dedicated job seekers","text":"This platform is no longer useful for finding a job. The app does all of what it can to keep the user locked in to the feed section.

When I go back to the job section, the job I was reviewing is no longer visible. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not deleted. It‚Äôs just hard to tell which one I was viewing, especially if you‚Äôre searching for similar jobs. It‚Äôs like as soon as you put your phone down, you lose place in line. It creates nothing but wasted time.\n\nFor anyone who has experienced a layoff, unemployment is a lot of work and it can easily wear you out. The last thing a person needs is a tool that slows them down. Of course a person can look elsewhere for jobs but why even have a job section if it has basic flaws.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-04-28T08:31:43-07:00"},{"id":"7219144169","userName":"missingmodule","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id150376134","version":"9.1.216","score":4,"title":"Useful but opportunities for improvement","text":"LinkedIn is the prime social networking app for professionals. Main avenue for jobs and all that.\n\nI think here‚Äôs some opportunities for improvement:\n\n1. Make a filter for company size when looking for jobs. \n\n2. A lot of recruiters post contracts as ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù as a sneaky way to get more applicants since they consider a full time role 40 hrs/week. Make this differentiation even clearer by saying ‚ÄúPermanent Full-Time.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how many contract roles I‚Äôve seen saying it‚Äôs Full-Time and luckily I read every description pretty carefully.\n\n3. Make an option for when Looking For Work is turned on, we can put more details for recruiters to see. I get hit up for temp/contracts all the time and have no interest in them. Recruiters don‚Äôt bother reading profiles.\n\n4. It would be great to have an option to rate or leave feedback on recruiters when you are communicating with them. Just like you have automatic ‚ÄúYes/Not interested‚Äù responses, there should be a way to leave feedback on recruiter accounts since so many recruiters are rude, ghost candidates, post things unrelated to your field/interests, solicit, etc.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-13T15:47:28-07:00"},{"id":"10459954879","userName":"Ajonesey22","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id190056456","version":"9.1.338","score":1,"title":"Paid experience is same as free experience","text":"I used a linked in free profile for a while and when I was on the job market decided to try premium.

My review is based on the fact that Face ID is not used by LinkedIn. LinkedIn‚Äòs responses leave your app signed in. I do not wish to do that, the information in the app is too private for me to take LinkedIn suggestion. The technology for Face ID has been incorporated to I would say 70 percent of the applications at this point, so it tells me that updating your app to use this functionality cannot be that difficult. I‚Äôll be waiting for the Face ID recognition in your app soon.

Sometimes I click on a person to message and it just never pulls up the conversation or freezes when I am trying to hit send. Also, when you have a search going, it now disappears the moment you click out of the app to read a text or something which makes you have to keep putting in what you are searching for and it never used to do that.  This app used to be great before they ruined it with pointless updates that only made things worse with no noticeable improvements.
