Actually for a long while. I deleted the app and reinstalled it again. Still wants to tell me to turn right at the stoplight before the highway while I’m sitting at it, and then tell me to turn around. Starts to fast cycle a reroute while I’m sitting at the light I’m trying to turn at. This app is lost!! I finally started using Apple Maps with no issues. Plus…. She yaps incessantly several times within a quarter mile. And my pet peeve, she says root instead of route!! LOL! 
But she’ll have you driving all over the place. Apple Maps doesn’t do that. Being stopped at a stoplight before your turn is bad for Google Maps! She’ll tell you to turn on that street then turn around, and then try and send you back down that street again! 
Too ignorant for me! I’ll use Apple Maps now!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T17:29:35-07:00

Lawn Pride took care of the areas in our yard where grass had stopped growing!!

Lawn Pride didn’t skip over areas that were hard to reach….and we know they didn’t skip those areas, because thistle that used to grow there is now gone!!
