First off, you cant rewind or repeat song‚Äôs, so you can only listen to the song once until it comes up on the playlist again. Second, instead of playing the actual song, it gives you a playlist with the song in it. If i wanted a playlist, i would play a playlist. Third, it adds songs to your custom playlist. If i didnt put it on the playlist, it means i dont want it on the playlist. Fourth, it stops playing a song in the middle of it, and when you try to keep playing it, it restarts the whole song. And finally, it has this stupid glitch where there‚Äôs no play button for the songs. I tried everything to fix it. I restarted the app, restared my phone, turning the wifi off and on again, using cellular data, but nothing worked. It wasnt something with the internet, because my other apps worked fine.

First of all why do you add songs to my playlist like I didn‚Äôt ask you like I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but I don‚Äôt know any songs that you added. I‚Äôm pretty much picky about stuff that I don‚Äôt have a lot of interest of since I‚Äôm making a playlist that includes hip hop and beats but I don‚Äôt have a lot of interest of hip hop since it‚Äôs kind of negative to me. But it‚Äôs ok since I have to add more songs in order for the app not to add more songs to my playlist.

I would‚Äôve given 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for this issue but due to this major inconvenience I give it 3.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-04T10:01:53-07:00"},{"id":"7303065922","userName":"Johnny Aloe Seed","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id957145538","version":"8.6.22","score":1,"title":"Extra LOUD ads on app","text":"The app is great with a fantastic selection of music in all languages and genres, unfortunately it is ruined by sometimes obtrusive and extremely LOUD commercials, that are not only louder than the music but have obnoxious and painful dynamics. \n\nOne commercial in particular has a woman loudly going PSSSS!!! PSSSS!!! as though whispering into your ear, only extremely loudly and with very painful sibilance.  It happens after a brief period of silence and if you are listening to gentle music it will make you jump in pain. My ear is ringing now and I wasn‚Äôt even using headphones or listening loudly on my tablet. Others have specifically complained about this commercial for at least two months and it is criminal that it is still being used. \n\nThe FCC made this practice illegal for TV advertisements and it‚Äôs shameful that companies need to be forced into following common decency by legislation, rather than ensuring that both the listener and advertisers can live together in harmony.  What is the point in having commercials if the listener is going to tear out their headphones in pain or mute the volume in disgust?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-05T18:29:45-07:00"},{"id":"2364314493","userName":"Magzzsszzzzssss9726üòí","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id406426135","version":"8.4.46","score":5,"title":"Amazing App just two issues","text":"I love this app and as a premium subscriber it suns even better. However, there's been a really annoying glitch that doesn't allow me add more songs to a playlist I just created. The number of songs isn't even the issue because it will simply not register my tap and if it does it will freeze and not add the song to the newly created playlist. This has been going for a few weeks now. Apart from this there use to be an amazing preview feature that allowed you to press on a song without playing or queuing it and it'd give you a 30 second preview of it-please bring this back it saved a lot of time. Aside from these issues though I strongly recommend this app, especially if you decide on premium. You can listen to your favorite songs in any order while offline and while traveling (airplane or road trips).","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-03-30T10:06:49-07:00"},{"id":"5233851307","userName":"Funny girl my name ok","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id578258447","version":"8.5.34","score":3,"title":"Free skips","text":"I love this app but I hate how I do like two skips and then it says that I have to pay for more skips but I really don‚Äôt want to.

Ok I Guess that‚Äôs all, I really just wanted to say something about the skips they just make me so mad when I skip two songs and there it says that I have to pay for more skips but the bad things about it is when I first got the app it was letting me have all the skips I want or it just let me pick a random song to play and now I can‚Äôt even do that, it only plays have of the song and I‚Äôm like omg nooooooo. But hopefully you read this and understand what I‚Äôm going through, and I know you need money and stuff but stilllllll come one, help a girl out.

There‚Äôs a serious issue here. I have a few different playlists with about 15+ songs on it so that it doesn‚Äôt play suggested songs along with the regular songs. It was working while I was working on things, but then the playlist was done and over with and randomly started playing different ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù songs. (which are songs i don‚Äôt like listening to anyways) I understand you guys need money, but why is it necessary to randomly switch to different songs? (which have nothing to do with the songs on my own playlist)It would be fine if I was able to switch to another playlist with the songs I actually have on them. But no, it‚Äôs still recommended songs even though I haven‚Äôt even played that playlist? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really unnecessary. This is why i‚Äôve stopped using the app anyways, I can‚Äôt keep listening when it randomly switches to different songs.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-04-14T13:14:32-07:00"},{"id":"3238644019","userName":"ANGfilmz","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id177405568","version":"8.4.72","score":1,"title":"ZERO STARS until further NOTICE!.!.!","text":"The last couple of updates are nothing more than a nuisance! I used to love this app, I didn‚Äôt care if it was on a premium account or free but the last few updates made using the app a little unbearable in a few ways. There‚Äôs NO LONGER a ‚ÄòMY SONGS‚Äô TAB which makes the app less pleasurable to use. I can no longer see SPECIFIC SOMGS under an artist WITHOUT HAVING to FOLLOW the artist and LIKE ALL of their songs. I literally go to my ‚ÄòARTIST‚Äô TAB and DON‚ÄôT see ANY of the songs I like, and I‚Äôm FORCED to play ALL of the artist‚Äôs songs INSTEAD of the many that I only LIKE by the artist. I DON‚Äôt want to HAVE to make a PLAYLIST every time I want to hear only 23 of the 84 tracks from a single artist it‚Äôs RIDICULOUS. It also PLAYS the EXACT same SONGS over and over even when in shuffle. The updates took over half of my songs away and I‚Äôm LIVID. And it RANDOMLY plays songs and artists that have NOTHING to do with the playlist or genre I‚Äôm TRYING to listen to. This app needs to return back to it‚Äôs former glory I‚Äôve been really fighting for this app. People try to sway me over to PANDORA but I DON‚ÄôT want to resort to using that crud.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-09-28T00:00:53-07:00"},{"id":"10424558913","userName":"OnlyMe&NotYou","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id87356481","version":"8.8.75","score":1,"title":"Sexist/Racist Against Women","text":"I used to love this app but the trashy sexist/racist artists and their garbage lyrics that belittle and have no respect for the female gender need to go. This treatment and app violates the constitution. Sorry but don‚Äôt give me the ‚Äúfreedom of expression‚Äù excuse here. An app that pushes and supports discrimination, but especially towards women is supporting a backwards society where women have been bashed and trashed since the beginning of time, and nothing has changed, and is just getting worse. Do you not have mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers? Do you not respect nor love and respect them? Apparently not. This treatment has no place in this alpha male, machismo society. It‚Äôs repulsive and hugely toxic, and is the model for future abuse of women. What the youth of today sees now paves the way for how they treat women in the future. If everyone is screaming racism these days, women should be at the very top screaming the absolute loudest. It‚Äôs about time. This app is appalling to me and turns my stomach, literally. Wish I could name these artists here. Asking Apple to remove less than stellar reviews is a known thing now. So I‚Äôll be watching.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-30T13:51:12-07:00"}]
