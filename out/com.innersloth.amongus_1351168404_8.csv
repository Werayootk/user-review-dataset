It makes it more difficult to speak especially when the meetings are sometimes very short. This update makes the games much shorter and we aren’t able to speak freely to each other. I know this is for the safety of children but the parents are irresponsible to let their kids come play with strangers they should’ve known that and that their child is playing with strangers. The game was fun but this new update has made it not that enjoyable since we can’t interact with New people and fun with talking to them. This also stops people from making friends. It’s all like we are people under a tyrant ruling we can say things that they want to say this update is terrible and it’s all because of irresponsible parents letting their child into a game with complete strangers and not telling what to do when some random person is asking them serious questions. This update is terrible and I don’t like it at all please change it I wanna play a good freedom of speech version of among us.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-13T13:25:01-07:00
6534994728,Raider!004,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id563624525,2020.9.9,4,Great but...,"Overall this is a pretty great game. However there are some recent issues that have come to light. For one being that I’m assuming that since your game has become very popular recently so the game can’t handle the amount of people on it. So you can never really get a game in. Another thing is that I find the roles of crew mate and imposter at times somewhat monotonous and boring. Especially if you’re a crewmate. I feel that there could be a lot more things that an imposter and crewmate could do to make it more fun and interactive. For example, maybe players can playfully brawl in the lobby. Or crewmates can use their pets as scouts to look elsewhere. But only at the risk of making themselves vulnerable. Etc. Yet I think this is a really fun game that has a lot of potential.

—— Revisit

I think it’d be great if ghosts can play tag while they’re dead. Cause it can get pretty annoying/boring. Like they would have to complete all of their tasks in order to play to give incentive to complete their tasks for the living crewmates to win. And when all of the current ghosts have finished, the game tag commences. And any new ghosts will have to complete their tasks to join in.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-14T10:48:37-07:00

I’ve been experiencing a glitch lately though that I thought I should tell you about. I’ve only experienced it on the Polus map, though it could be on the others: when I went to do the temperature task by the lava pit in Polus, I clicked the “use” triangle but the task didn’t open. This also happened in the Laboratory. The only way that the crew mates were able to win was to vote out the imposter. The glitch happened on all the rounds I played in Polus, but it hadn’t happened before. I just thought to let you know about this, because it causes a big problems for the players. The game is absolutely phenomenal outside the glitch 😊 keep up the great work!

Edit: I played on each of the maps, and found that the glitch is only happening on the temperature tasks in the map Polus. Just wanted to let you know 😊

Edit 2: I would like to say thanks for having an update that fixed the tasks! The game is a 10 out of 5 stars and I recommend it to everyone! Recently my mom got the game and she loves it to! Great work innersloth!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-24T14:57:59-07:00

I thought maybe you could add a infect mode? Where you can infect people to help you kill? Maybe you could add kidnapping that sends an alert that someone is missing and you have to find them but you cant do tasks while a kidnapping is going on. Maybe you could add more events like a fire. Maybe new maps, What about a map where there is a portal to another map so there is 2 maps in one huge map. You could add explosions, or a map where there are different floors. Anyway, I don't expect you to see this but I LOVE YOUR GAME! So many people do! As you might know, there are haters but dont listen to them. This is a great game I play it almost every day! My friends and family love it too. The haters really are losing the battle so just keep doing what so many people love! If you want to add some of these ideas I'd be so happy but for now just keep doing what you do!(Also some people are complaining about the censor chat so could you make it safer?

Something I suggest is making a way in which people can activate old textures for their view only. Also, add a way to see if your friends are playing the game or not. Me and my friends love to play this game together, but we can’t normally get together because I have no way to see if they are online or not. Another tip that I have is to fix when the game randomly kicks you out. I find that sometimes when I get imposter, I just get kicked out of the game and it is so frustrating and I’m sure a lot of people can agree with that. Also, maybe add some game modes. A few idea are hide-and-seek, a detective mode, and a mode where the ship is going to crash back to Earth and you have to try to save it. For hide and seek you can be either hider or seeker, the hiders can duck under boxes and hide in vents. But to keep the game interesting, every two minutes, all hiders must move spots and they have ten seconds before the seeker comes to get them. When a hider is tagged, they become a seeker. For detective mode, someone is is the detective, and the other crew mates have to try to get them out. This is a great game, and these are a few tips to make it better!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-19T06:21:40-07:00

Stage 2: ummmmm I still love this game but I can’t even type I know that it was added for no inappropriate content buuuut it makes so other kinds of annoying 1. I can’t type I can’t say orange did so in so because I have to scour the whole thing to find the sentences I need seriously that’s kinda why I gave up on this game. This game used to be a game where the imposter could be an actor but with statements you can’t tell if they are lying or not convicted? 2. The new update you have to make an account come on! This is supposed to be a game for kids and I don’t even know why. To all those people out there I bet 101 percent that the game was muuuuuuucccch better than this but I just can’t see what the game makers thought of when they said play among us. But some people may think the game is much better but I think that they better do a good job on trying to point out to me that the game isn’t ruined. Still not convinced? Well you win 3. Break down.

I noticed that when I go to games, people don’t, and maybe aren’t able to type in the chat anymore, there is no more conversation. 

Also with the new update it makes it hard to type what you really mean, there aren’t a lot of options of words for us to choose, to say what we are trying to suggest. I think that we should take the update down, and that we should be able to at least have messages edited, like if there is a bad word it is blurred out, the change of the chat is probably why this update occurred in the first place, and I completely understand the concern. 

Due to not being able to type in the chat, the only way that I can communicate to play the game is by talking, and on the game you can’t hear everyone’s voices, so I am only able to play with my friends if I call them or text. I think that many people that play the game wants the original version back, it was just easier, and a little more fun that way .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-19T19:03:51-07:00

I qualified for the quick chat and I thought it would just give me options to say so I don’t waste time. It was what I thought it was like...until I realized I couldn’t even type in the chat. I couldn’t say anything I wanted to. I can’t even say hi to people! Innersloth states that it’s easier, faster, and safer. But it’s not easy. You have to search through all the little quotes just to find the one you’re looking for, which is also why it’s not faster. And, I guess you could say it’s safe. I’m not sure I like this update, out of ALL the among us updates. Please fix it so us players can at least type things other than the ones we are supposed to. I would like to say hi to other players!

It is unfair to other players who just want to play correctly without some loser hacking the game. they should be banned for hacking the game or even TRYING. Next is kicking. i hate how players call emergency meetings for no reason at the beginning of games and say nothing and it wastes time and the host don’t kick them out so we have to wait for the voting time to end so we can vote them out. if you can please fix this it would be great !",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-23T21:07:39-07:00

My first complaint is that one of my friends lately has not been able to get in without having to wait over 15 minutes at one time, so if you are a game creator of Among Us and you see this please tell how I can possibly fix that. One other thing that happens in Among Us every once in a while is that the game completely glitches, sometimes your screen goes black, sometimes something gets stuck are your such as the voting page and then you are not able to play or sometimes it gets stuck on the playing page and then you can not vote.

2) PING. I have no clue what ping is but it’s Annoying. If it gets higher then 6000 it kicks the whole server. If there are 15/15 people in a server and it’s about to start but ping is at let’s say 5000 then everyone gets kicked. Once it happened to me 4 times in a row!

3) FREE CHAT😡😡. I love free chat but people that can’t have their Apple ID into their AC (like me) can’t play with free chat. I think everyone should be allowed to play free chat. This is called being rude because everyone hates how you have it so people who haven’t signed into their Apple ID don’t get the play. 
I also hate when there are multiple people being picked and then the next round the same person being picked. I mean.

I understand that people can say really mean things in the chat, but don’t take it away completely, maybe just censor certain words. I was also mad about the display names and the fact that you have to stick with a default one.

Between roles, unlockables, HUD updates, and achievements, it’s went from a 2/5 to a 5/5. However, there is one thing that is awful: the bugs. One minor one that gives crewmates an auto loss, where it overlays the hub over the starting area. Then an imposter can use a sabotage to kill everyone, and they win. However, this one next one is huge and makes the game literally unplayable. If you join a lobby, play a full game, leave, join a different one, and wait for the round to start, the game closes. This wouldn’t be so bad if not for a different new feature: temporarily banning. I like the concept. If a person intentionally leaves a game, they will get banned for 30 minutes, then an hour. How do I know this, you may ask? Well, when the game crashes like said previously, it triggers the ban feature! So, because the game has a bug, I get blocked from playing for a full hour!

I just wish a few things were added to the game. I feel like impostors should be able to read and reply to ghost chat, like maybe have two chats on the impostors screen one only ghosts can see and the other everyone sees, a lot of my friends also agree that the game would be much more fun if the impostors could talk to the ghosts. I also would love to see more colors be added to the game, like maybe some pastels or an option that you can make your own color.  Another addition I would love to see is girl clothing options, right now all the outfits are really geared towards males and I can never find an outfit I would actually wear, I would definitely spend more money that way!😂 Also I do get kicked out of games a lot when I shouldn’t, it would be in the middle of a round and the game will glitch and say I don’t have internet even though my phone still has full bars.

In 2020 when it became such a great hit, and I loved the game. I played it almost everyday! I unfortunately stopped and never got to play the old version of the game and when I came back, almost EVERYTHING looked different! I was so confused. So I decided to play a round and when I finally got in to change my avatar, so many beautiful colors! I was completely amazed on how much they updated, but then I went to go see if I could put my ‘lil among us tiny boi’ on, but I couldn’t cuz he was gone. And I’d bought a lot of those with MY money, and now their gone. But that wasn’t the only thing, when I discovered a dead body, I mean everything looked normal, the map, the characters, but after reporting that body, the whole discussion chat looked weird. When I tried typing in chat, it didn’t work. So I was confused. So I never got to explain myself. So my two complaints of the new update: my little pet accessories were gone and, you can’t type in chat. I later came to realize that you couldn’t change your name, and you had to sign in to have free chat. But overall I love Among Us!

For a game that is supposedly for people 9 and up, (and let’s face it, nobody follows those guidelines) this game can be very unsafe and inappropriate for minors. The minuscule censorship on the chat (that can easily be turned off) provides for a very inappropriate and toxic environment in almost every server I have ever joined. There are people swearing, talking about lewd topics, profanities, and on many occasions, people asking others for ages, phone numbers, and more private information. This is a very unsafe environment for children. I have had many encounters with creeps on this “children’s” game. It is very sad when people are trying to play a normal game and somebody asks about adult websites and other sexual topics. This game is a great game, but please, impose some sort of safety and censorship on the chat, like Roblox. You probably won’t see this, and it might make people mad, but I am not asking you to make it impossible to say anything in the chat, just inappropriate terms and profanities that ruin the fun of the game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-05T17:19:09-07:00

I play among us more than I do chores. So yeah it’s kind of addicting. But it still has a few disadvantages, like how whenever I go to join a map it says it’s either full or already started. But whenever I go back to I am up again it’s still there. So I think that whenever map is full or already started, they should be taken off the list. I have another disadvantage. There are a lot of hats that you can put on your character for free but you can’t put on any outfits or pets without paying for them some people are allowed to pay for those items but really want those items.I think if you those outfits and pets should be put on for free so other peopleThey aren’t allowed to buy that kind of stuff can use some of those things.

This game is an amazing version of a murder mystery. Its perfect for many ages, it not too intense for younger players and its fun for families! This game is amazing and I love it.
But I few things are bothering me. One, it the pets. I know you have to buy the pets, but you have to buy all of them individually ($3 each) along with the outfits and stuff. I would ask maybe if there be like three default pets for people to use since there are many younger players who cant get any of those. So maybe just three default pets for people to use would be great. Also, many older players turn this cute fun game into some sort of toxic dating app. It would be cool if when people first get the game that it asks the age and then will sort them into groups around their age, just so little kids don’t get traumatized or tricked. And yes, some people will lie about their ages, but I’m sure most people don’t. So, at least it will be 
safer for more people.
Other than those things, the game is so fun, and just perfect for family and friends to play! I love this game and I’m sure everyone else will!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-02T16:46:33-07:00

I got it because it’s what all the clubs at my high school are playing, and it’s a good way to connect in shelter-in-place. However, I have never been so frustrated with a game. It seems like all my friends can play, but it always disconnects me because the “packets” don’t come back. I know what pinging is and what packets are in computer lingo, but I get this disconnected notice every time I try to join a game, start a new round, or navigate to other apps while attempting to play private mode. Really, a game this popular should have bugs worked out. Since you are at the top of the charts and the focus of a billion memes, you should have the budget to get someone to fix these bugs. It’s ridiculous and annoying that I can’t play with my friends but I can play with total strangers. Fix these bugs and you’ll have a timeless game. I tried to play on both IPad Pro 2017 and IPhone 5s, and even a different network and neither worked. If you are playing just for short, fun and entertainment with strangers, this is a great game.

But I’m not here to talk about the bad things I’m here to talk about the good things😘😛 So anyway, the great thing is, is that you can customize your character but there can only be one of a color in a match and if you have that color but someone else has it when you join it will change. And I love the fact that you can “sabotage” things like the lights and reactor when imposter. There is the guardian angel role, engineer, normal crewmate, normal imposter, scientist, and the SHAPESHIFTER!! Bruh that was dumb😑.

But I’m not too worried about that so if you don’t want to add that I’m not gonna be heartbroken so yea. And you guys MUST add more MODES like hide and seek because it’s annoying when a new player joins and either they don’t know how to play or they play it different. Another mode you could add is a playground or something where you can chill and not worry about dying and hangout with your in game friends (friending system) and not be kicked out because of inactivity. But also something to entertain us beans when we’re in the playground like maybe a bunch of fun mini games and you could get beans from winning or something 😁 anyway that’s about it.

Also let people stay connected to the internet or server whatever because my iPad closes so when I get back on a round I lose everything. That is all I have to say. Thank you for reading this review!

It really is a blast if you have a good group to play with and I love that you can customize the game to fit your play style. I do see a lot of complaints that could be solved by lobby hosts simply balancing those options to fit your group’s play style. There are a lot of good suggestions for optimizing play out there. I also see complaints about how others play, the tactics and language they use, etc. Seems like kicking them or voting them off is a good solution to that particular problem. One thing I’m starting to get very frustrated about tho (and I know I’m not the only one) in public lobbies is when 3-5 people instantly quit within the first few seconds of the game because they don’t get impostor. I think a simple solution would be that anyone who quits in the middle of the game can’t join another lobby until that current game is over. Or maybe a 5 minute timeout or even being unable to quit until you have died, something like that.

It’s so annoying after such a long time u are finally imposter and then half of the server leaves bc they aren’t the imposter. Some more thing u could add would be like when u come into public games and there are servers u clock a server and it says “there is 10 people in this game” then why do u put it on there.? Also there should be more people allowed to join a game it would make the game way better and going along with that there should be a thing in the beginning or end of a game you can send like a friend request bc I know almost everyone who plays this game meet very nice people but then on of you guys have to leave and then u never see them again which can be very sad and annoying. But other then that the game is very good I really like the concept and keep up the good work!!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-21T00:06:32-07:00

I had an experience with a user that kept on calling me Mexican, even though im not, i just know how to speak Spanish. He ended being banned by me for being extremely racist and disturbingly disrespectful. I would have loved for a “report button” feature to be available. But I also understand why one doesn’t exist, there is no registration sequence to play the game... but isn’t there a player id? Why not permanently ban an id from joining another id in the same server, hence a “report” feature. My other argument is the constant crashes in game, it gets pretty annoying. I play the game on in ‘ipad 6th gen’ and since the new “regional” update, crashes have been pretty constant. Please look into these, especially the crashes. I hope feedback like these make the game even better! :)
Update: It crashes more and more every day, as in it gets worse. Please, fix this, i am not having fun anymore. The game takes me out after every game or even in a game, and it’s annoying.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-05T11:17:57-07:00

It’s a great game though and also are hard to play with because of guardian angel and shapeshifter mostly. You might see someone kill but they could be the shapeshifter and if someone tries to kill you, but you get protected by the guardian angel, you know who the impostor is, I like that but it isn’t really fair to the impostor. Also if shapeshifter shape-shifts and tries to kill someone that has been protected, the one that got protected could tell the other players who they thought tried to kill them, be wrong, and then they would be sus and get voted out and if there is only three people left, they would lose and the ghosts might get a little angry of not thinking about the shapeshifter and so would the other player that was still alive. Since I only dislike those roles, I still gave it four stars because I like the game.(Also I don’t really like how a lot of people want to play with 15 because I just like playing with 10)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-15T19:25:45-07:00

I even enjoyed playing it on my phone so much that I decided I wanted to try it out on my mac but when I went to change my birth year on my mac, it reset back to 2021 and then confirmed it as my birth year before I could do anything about it. Now it won't let me log into my old account without parental consent which involves sending in data that I personally, am not comfortable sending to a random company on the internet. (One of the confirmation methods involves sending in money?) My account used to say I was 21  but now says that I am 0 which would be nearly impossible for a infant to set up an among us account. This account also has my data and purchases held on it and I do not want to lose that content. Along with this I have searched the app for any type of ""help center"" and there's no tech support. At this point if I want to continue playing I will have to just drop the old account completely. And if I do end up redownloading, I for sure will not be playing the mac version as I don't want to come accross this issue again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-14T19:21:25-07:00
8056062465,Cherry UvU',https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1133668655,2021.11.10,3,It’s half-half,"To be honest it’s a fun game, it was really popular, and an amazing game! But with the new update about like how you can only do random usernames, and only say certain things when in meeting. It’s not as fun. Maybe the reason if because people were saying to many cuss words! But that doesn’t give you a reason to ruin it for everybody else. Maybe if that was the reason, you can maybe censor cuss words and if somebody says to many censored things than you can give them a warning, to many warnings and on and on that’s your decision. But not having a true opinion in the game is sorta boring and annoying. Before the new update I loved making it hide-n-seek! It was my favorite thing, I would have either other people or my family play, the seeker/impostor would have terrible eyesight while the rest had amazing eyesight and nobody was allowed the report the bodies. But thanks to the update I can’t tell anybody like “We’re playing hide-n-seek! No reporting the bodies, blah blah blah!” In conclusion(I have been writing to many essays for school) Maybe you could just go back to the old Among Us, just with a couple twerks like my censoring option.

My only issue so far? Is that there are only three servers worldwide and when one goes down you practically can’t play the game at all anymore, even if you switch to a different server. This was the reason I deleted this app for the first time; bc the servers were always down. I re-downloaded the app after a few months when they had released the new colors and the new Airship map. I haven’t had issues for two weeks since downloading it again. But after two weeks of no problems it seems like the both the North America and Europe servers are down and there are never any local servers, at least that are available to me.
It would be really nice if there were more servers worldwide so that maybe the three servers that are available at the moment wouldn’t have so much riding on them anymore and would allow them, and the new worldwide servers, to function properly and not experience as many problems causing people to be unable to enjoy the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-17T05:15:30-07:00

But I don’t get it. I mean, when I report a body, or someone vented on cams, I have to literally find out what to press, it’s confusing. I get why you did quick chat, because a lot of people sometimes do inappropriate stuff. But you didn’t have to change it to this. You could just block out the words that you don’t want them to say, kind of like roblox, when you type something your not suppose to say and it will just block the word out. It’s simple. But your not letting kids have fun. It’s not even fun if you can’t type what you want! I might be quitting among us. Plus people could change their birthdays to say they are over 18. Can you please fix the quick chat please. Or lots of other people are going to quit. Among us is boring now! You can’t have fun, like with new friends you make. All you can really say, is “Hi” Or “Yeet” like really- yeet? And hi? So..

Out of the all the mobile games it is easily the best, so of course I only have one critique. Because of how personal this is, it didn’t affect the overall rating I gave it, it’s just kind of something that has been eating at me ever since I downloaded the app. Throughout my time playing this cool game, I have made genuine friends in all corners of the three maps. But there is no add friend functionality, so after we connect we can never see each other again. I wouldn’t have included this at all if it weren’t for the incident that occurred earlier today. The name I gave myself in this game is,”Johnnycake” and all I was doing was trying to search for other characters( no I was not trying to role play) because I thought it would be such a funny coincidence. So I was looking for a game and before I could tap on the lobby entitled,”Sodapop” my finger had clicked back to the menu. And then he was gone. Along with my dreams of befriending the many diverse people of Among Us. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.
