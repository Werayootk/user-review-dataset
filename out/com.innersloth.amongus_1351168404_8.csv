It makes it more difficult to speak especially when the meetings are sometimes very short. This update makes the games much shorter and we aren‚Äôt able to speak freely to each other. I know this is for the safety of children but the parents are irresponsible to let their kids come play with strangers they should‚Äôve known that and that their child is playing with strangers. The game was fun but this new update has made it not that enjoyable since we can‚Äôt interact with New people and fun with talking to them. This also stops people from making friends. It‚Äôs all like we are people under a tyrant ruling we can say things that they want to say this update is terrible and it‚Äôs all because of irresponsible parents letting their child into a game with complete strangers and not telling what to do when some random person is asking them serious questions. This update is terrible and I don‚Äôt like it at all please change it I wanna play a good freedom of speech version of among us.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-13T13:25:01-07:00
6534994728,Raider!004,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id563624525,2020.9.9,4,Great but...,"Overall this is a pretty great game. However there are some recent issues that have come to light. For one being that I‚Äôm assuming that since your game has become very popular recently so the game can‚Äôt handle the amount of people on it. So you can never really get a game in. Another thing is that I find the roles of crew mate and imposter at times somewhat monotonous and boring. Especially if you‚Äôre a crewmate. I feel that there could be a lot more things that an imposter and crewmate could do to make it more fun and interactive. For example, maybe players can playfully brawl in the lobby. Or crewmates can use their pets as scouts to look elsewhere. But only at the risk of making themselves vulnerable. Etc. Yet I think this is a really fun game that has a lot of potential.

‚Äî‚Äî Revisit

I think it‚Äôd be great if ghosts can play tag while they‚Äôre dead. Cause it can get pretty annoying/boring. Like they would have to complete all of their tasks in order to play to give incentive to complete their tasks for the living crewmates to win. And when all of the current ghosts have finished, the game tag commences. And any new ghosts will have to complete their tasks to join in.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-14T10:48:37-07:00

I‚Äôve been experiencing a glitch lately though that I thought I should tell you about. I‚Äôve only experienced it on the Polus map, though it could be on the others: when I went to do the temperature task by the lava pit in Polus, I clicked the ‚Äúuse‚Äù triangle but the task didn‚Äôt open. This also happened in the Laboratory. The only way that the crew mates were able to win was to vote out the imposter. The glitch happened on all the rounds I played in Polus, but it hadn‚Äôt happened before. I just thought to let you know about this, because it causes a big problems for the players. The game is absolutely phenomenal outside the glitch üòä keep up the great work!

Edit: I played on each of the maps, and found that the glitch is only happening on the temperature tasks in the map Polus. Just wanted to let you know üòä

Edit 2: I would like to say thanks for having an update that fixed the tasks! The game is a 10 out of 5 stars and I recommend it to everyone! Recently my mom got the game and she loves it to!

I thought maybe you could add a infect mode? Where you can infect people to help you kill? Maybe you could add kidnapping that sends an alert that someone is missing and you have to find them but you cant do tasks while a kidnapping is going on. Maybe you could add more events like a fire. Maybe new maps, What about a map where there is a portal to another map so there is 2 maps in one huge map. You could add explosions, or a map where there are different floors. Anyway, I don't expect you to see this but I LOVE YOUR GAME! So many people do! As you might know, there are haters but dont listen to them. This is a great game I play it almost every day! My friends and family love it too. The haters really are losing the battle so just keep doing what so many people love! If you want to add some of these ideas I'd be so happy but for now just keep doing what you do!(Also some people are complaining about the censor chat so could you make it safer?

Something I suggest is making a way in which people can activate old textures for their view only. Also, add a way to see if your friends are playing the game or not. Me and my friends love to play this game together, but we can‚Äôt normally get together because I have no way to see if they are online or not. Another tip that I have is to fix when the game randomly kicks you out. I find that sometimes when I get imposter, I just get kicked out of the game and it is so frustrating and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people can agree with that. Also, maybe add some game modes. A few idea are hide-and-seek, a detective mode, and a mode where the ship is going to crash back to Earth and you have to try to save it. For hide and seek you can be either hider or seeker, the hiders can duck under boxes and hide in vents. But to keep the game interesting, every two minutes, all hiders must move spots and they have ten seconds before the seeker comes to get them. When a hider is tagged, they become a seeker. For detective mode, someone is is the detective, and the other crew mates have to try to get them out.

I noticed that when I go to games, people don‚Äôt, and maybe aren‚Äôt able to type in the chat anymore, there is no more conversation. 

Also with the new update it makes it hard to type what you really mean, there aren‚Äôt a lot of options of words for us to choose, to say what we are trying to suggest. I think that we should take the update down, and that we should be able to at least have messages edited, like if there is a bad word it is blurred out, the change of the chat is probably why this update occurred in the first place, and I completely understand the concern. 

Due to not being able to type in the chat, the only way that I can communicate to play the game is by talking, and on the game you can‚Äôt hear everyone‚Äôs voices, so I am only able to play with my friends if I call them or text.

My first complaint is that one of my friends lately has not been able to get in without having to wait over 15 minutes at one time, so if you are a game creator of Among Us and you see this please tell how I can possibly fix that. One other thing that happens in Among Us every once in a while is that the game completely glitches, sometimes your screen goes black, sometimes something gets stuck are your such as the voting page and then you are not able to play or sometimes it gets stuck on the playing page and then you can not vote.

However, this one next one is huge and makes the game literally unplayable. If you join a lobby, play a full game, leave, join a different one, and wait for the round to start, the game closes. This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if not for a different new feature: temporarily banning. I like the concept. If a person intentionally leaves a game, they will get banned for 30 minutes, then an hour.

Just a some small problems, there are a lot of innapropriate names and stuff in the chat. I know there is restrictions on what you can name yourself but people have found ways to work past them and use symbols or spell it differently. This game make the game innapropriate for young children.

I just wish a few things were added to the game. I feel like impostors should be able to read and reply to ghost chat, like maybe have two chats on the impostors screen one only ghosts can see and the other everyone sees, a lot of my friends also agree that the game would be much more fun if the impostors could talk to the ghosts. I also would love to see more colors be added to the game, like maybe some pastels or an option that you can make your own color.  Another addition I would love to see is girl clothing options, right now all the outfits are really geared towards males and I can never find an outfit I would actually wear, I would definitely spend more money that way!üòÇ Also I do get kicked out of games a lot when I shouldn‚Äôt, it would be in the middle of a round and the game will glitch and say I don‚Äôt have internet even though my phone still has full bars.

In 2020 when it became such a great hit, and I loved the game. I played it almost everyday! I unfortunately stopped and never got to play the old version of the game and when I came back, almost EVERYTHING looked different! I was so confused. So I decided to play a round and when I finally got in to change my avatar, so many beautiful colors! I was completely amazed on how much they updated, but then I went to go see if I could put my ‚Äòlil among us tiny boi‚Äô on, but I couldn‚Äôt cuz he was gone. And I‚Äôd bought a lot of those with MY money, and now their gone. But that wasn‚Äôt the only thing, when I discovered a dead body, I mean everything looked normal, the map, the characters, but after reporting that body, the whole discussion chat looked weird. When I tried typing in chat, it didn‚Äôt work. So I was confused. So I never got to explain myself. So my two complaints of the new update: my little pet accessories were gone and, you can‚Äôt type in chat. I later came to realize that you couldn‚Äôt change your name, and you had to sign in to have free chat. But overall I love Among Us!

For a game that is supposedly for people 9 and up, (and let‚Äôs face it, nobody follows those guidelines) this game can be very unsafe and inappropriate for minors. The minuscule censorship on the chat (that can easily be turned off) provides for a very inappropriate and toxic environment in almost every server I have ever joined. There are people swearing, talking about lewd topics, profanities, and on many occasions, people asking others for ages, phone numbers, and more private information. This is a very unsafe environment for children. I have had many encounters with creeps on this ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs‚Äù game. It is very sad when people are trying to play a normal game and somebody asks about adult websites and other sexual topics. This game is a great game, but please, impose some sort of safety and censorship on the chat, like Roblox. You probably won‚Äôt see this, and it might make people mad, but I am not asking you to make it impossible to say anything in the chat, just inappropriate terms and profanities that ruin the fun of the game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-05T17:19:09-07:00

But whenever I go back to I am up again it‚Äôs still there. So I think that whenever map is full or already started, they should be taken off the list. I have another disadvantage. There are a lot of hats that you can put on your character for free but you can‚Äôt put on any outfits or pets without paying for them some people are allowed to pay for those items but really want those items.I think if you those outfits and pets should be put on for free so other peopleThey aren‚Äôt allowed to buy that kind of stuff can use some of those things.

This game is an amazing version of a murder mystery. Its perfect for many ages, it not too intense for younger players and its fun for families! This game is amazing and I love it.
But I few things are bothering me. One, it the pets. I know you have to buy the pets, but you have to buy all of them individually ($3 each) along with the outfits and stuff. I would ask maybe if there be like three default pets for people to use since there are many younger players who cant get any of those. So maybe just three default pets for people to use would be great. Also, many older players turn this cute fun game into some sort of toxic dating app. It would be cool if when people first get the game that it asks the age and then will sort them into groups around their age, just so little kids don‚Äôt get traumatized or tricked. And yes, some people will lie about their ages, but I‚Äôm sure most people don‚Äôt. So, at least it will be 
safer for more people.

One thing I‚Äôm starting to get very frustrated about tho (and I know I‚Äôm not the only one) in public lobbies is when 3-5 people instantly quit within the first few seconds of the game because they don‚Äôt get impostor. I think a simple solution would be that anyone who quits in the middle of the game can‚Äôt join another lobby until that current game is over. Or maybe a 5 minute timeout or even being unable to quit until you have died, something like that. Other than that, this is great fun (typical online jerk behavior from other players notwithstanding)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-27T13:55:57-07:00
6557623783,the fat patato,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1037660156,2020.9.9,3,Good but....,It‚Äôs a very good and addicting game! And it‚Äôs very fun to play with friends! But the one thing is that there should be updates/changes. Like we should be able to get imposter more. And I know this is a problem with a lot of people. Also we should not be able to leave unless there is like a WiFi problem and what I mean by this is u can‚Äôt leave in the middle of the game unless u have died or WiFi problems. It‚Äôs so annoying after such a long time u are finally imposter and then half of the server leaves bc they aren‚Äôt the imposter. Some more thing u could add would be like when u come into public games and there are servers u clock a server and it says ‚Äúthere is 10 people in this game‚Äù then why do u put it on there.? Also there should be more people allowed to join a game it would make the game way better and going along with that there should be a thing in the beginning or end of a game you can send like a friend request bc I know almost everyone who plays this game meet very nice people but then on of you guys have to leave and then u never see them again which can be very sad and annoying. But other then that the game is very good I really like the concept and keep up the good work!!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-21T00:06:32-07:00

I had an experience with a user that kept on calling me Mexican, even though im not, i just know how to speak Spanish. He ended being banned by me for being extremely racist and disturbingly disrespectful. I would have loved for a ‚Äúreport button‚Äù feature to be available. But I also understand why one doesn‚Äôt exist, there is no registration sequence to play the game... but isn‚Äôt there a player id? Why not permanently ban an id from joining another id in the same server, hence a ‚Äúreport‚Äù feature. My other argument is the constant crashes in game, it gets pretty annoying. I play the game on in ‚Äòipad 6th gen‚Äô and since the new ‚Äúregional‚Äù update, crashes have been pretty constant. Please look into these, especially the crashes. I hope feedback like these make the game even better! :)
Update: It crashes more and more every day, as in it gets worse. Please, fix this, i am not having fun anymore. The game takes me out after every game or even in a game, and it‚Äôs annoying.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-05T11:17:57-07:00

It‚Äôs a great game though and also are hard to play with because of guardian angel and shapeshifter mostly. You might see someone kill but they could be the shapeshifter and if someone tries to kill you, but you get protected by the guardian angel, you know who the impostor is, I like that but it isn‚Äôt really fair to the impostor. Also if shapeshifter shape-shifts and tries to kill someone that has been protected, the one that got protected could tell the other players who they thought tried to kill them, be wrong, and then they would be sus and get voted out and if there is only three people left, they would lose and the ghosts might get a little angry of not thinking about the shapeshifter and so would the other player that was still alive. Since I only dislike those roles, I still gave it four stars because I like the game.(Also I don‚Äôt really like how a lot of people want to play with 15 because I just like playing with 10)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-15T19:25:45-07:00

I even enjoyed playing it on my phone so much that I decided I wanted to try it out on my mac but when I went to change my birth year on my mac, it reset back to 2021 and then confirmed it as my birth year before I could do anything about it. Now it won't let me log into my old account without parental consent which involves sending in data that I personally, am not comfortable sending to a random company on the internet. (One of the confirmation methods involves sending in money?) My account used to say I was 21  but now says that I am 0 which would be nearly impossible for a infant to set up an among us account. This account also has my data and purchases held on it and I do not want to lose that content. Along with this I have searched the app for any type of ""help center"" and there's no tech support. At this point if I want to continue playing I will have to just drop the old account completely. And if I do end up redownloading, I for sure will not be playing the mac version as I don't want to come accross this issue again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-14T19:21:25-07:00

But with the new update about like how you can only do random usernames, and only say certain things when in meeting. It‚Äôs not as fun. Maybe the reason if because people were saying to many cuss words! But that doesn‚Äôt give you a reason to ruin it for everybody else. Maybe if that was the reason, you can maybe censor cuss words and if somebody says to many censored things than you can give them a warning, to many warnings and on and on that‚Äôs your decision. But not having a true opinion in the game is sorta boring and annoying. Before the new update I loved making it hide-n-seek! It was my favorite thing, I would have either other people or my family play, the seeker/impostor would have terrible eyesight while the rest had amazing eyesight and nobody was allowed the report the bodies. But thanks to the update I can‚Äôt tell anybody like ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing hide-n-seek! No reporting the bodies, blah blah blah!‚Äù In conclusion(I have been writing to many essays for school) Maybe you could just go back to the old Among Us, just with a couple twerks like my censoring option.

My only issue so far? Is that there are only three servers worldwide and when one goes down you practically can‚Äôt play the game at all anymore, even if you switch to a different server. This was the reason I deleted this app for the first time; bc the servers were always down. I re-downloaded the app after a few months when they had released the new colors and the new Airship map. I haven‚Äôt had issues for two weeks since downloading it again. But after two weeks of no problems it seems like the both the North America and Europe servers are down and there are never any local servers, at least that are available to me.
It would be really nice if there were more servers worldwide so that maybe the three servers that are available at the moment wouldn‚Äôt have so much riding on them anymore and would allow them, and the new worldwide servers, to function properly and not experience as many problems causing people to be unable to enjoy the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-17T05:15:30-07:00

Out of the all the mobile games it is easily the best, so of course I only have one critique. Because of how personal this is, it didn‚Äôt affect the overall rating I gave it, it‚Äôs just kind of something that has been eating at me ever since I downloaded the app. Throughout my time playing this cool game, I have made genuine friends in all corners of the three maps. But there is no add friend functionality, so after we connect we can never see each other again. I wouldn‚Äôt have included this at all if it weren‚Äôt for the incident that occurred earlier today. The name I gave myself in this game is,‚ÄùJohnnycake‚Äù and all I was doing was trying to search for other characters( no I was not trying to role play) because I thought it would be such a funny coincidence. So I was looking for a game and before I could tap on the lobby entitled,‚ÄùSodapop‚Äù my finger had clicked back to the menu. And then he was gone.
