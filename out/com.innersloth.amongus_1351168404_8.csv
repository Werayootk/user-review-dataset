It is capable of using up all the storage on iPhone, which I like. And the game will never die as I know it. My issues with the game is:
1. The iOS and Android version of Among Us isn’t as smooth as PC version of Among Us, which can be found on Steam, Microsoft Store, Epic Games, etc. The PC version of Among Us is capable of 60hz refresh rate or higher, but the mobile version of Among Us is only capable of 45hz.
2. In the mobile versions of Among Us, you can’t use these common symbols: (“ ‘), but the PC versions of Among Us are probably capable of those!
3. When you tap an UI element with one finger in Mobile Among Us, it doesn’t turn green like it does on PC!
4. The graphics tab in Mobile Among Us settings isn’t as advanced as the graphics tab in PC Among Us settings!
Those 4 issues are my biggest problems with Among Us, and in the next big update, I want you to fix the low refresh rate problem on Mobile Among Us, the (“ ‘) symbols not working on Mobile Among Us chat, elements not turning green when you tap them with 1 finger in Mobile Among Us, and the basic Graphics Tab issue in Mobile Among Us settings! If you fix all the 4 issues I had, then I will rate it 5 stars and say “Thank you!”.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-24T12:15:33-07:00

Honestly, I’ve played among us for awhile. I’ve seen it grow over the years, and now it’s turned to something different! Which I rlly like! Yet, there’s one thing that annoys me. So, every time I join it tells me 2 times my Apple ID cannot be created because of apps or something. It really annoys me considering I want to be able to have access to free chat like a few years ago, and have my OWN name. I’m really frustrated at this situation :(. Hope you respond developers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-21T16:32:18-07:00
