It’s now harder to switch accounts, and having no lines or color differences in between emails and search bar make everything a little jarring to the eyes.\nSwitching gmail accounts used to be conveniently placed in the same area you’d click on to switch from inbox to folders and easily accessed by a simple swipe. Now it’s separated entirely from the other folders, and takes longer to switch as you wait for the screen to pop up that has your different accounts listed, finding the correct account on it’s no-separation white back ground redesign, then select it. \nIt now takes me more time to check one account than it did to check all of my accounts with the old set up. More difficult switching among accounts, and its jarringly bright white new color scheme make me wish google would’ve left well enough alone.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-02-22T09:36:52-07:00"},{"id":"6152604124","userName":"Suzyelle","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id396816620","version":"6.0.200531","score":3,"title":"Needs more versatility","text":"Compared to Outlook, the Gmail app is sub-par. With Outlook, the important emails are separated from the unimportant in BOTH views, but in Gmail, they are together in the unimportant view which makes scrolling and deleting cumbersome. It is impossible to create rules in the app, and the app doesn’t remember where certain kinds of emails, like those from PayPal for example, are moved to a folder, so you have to scroll down each time instead of getting a popup screen asking if you want it in the folder you have been putting those type emails into or another. You can open Gmail in a search engine and request a desktop view to do some of these things, but then why have an app? In my view, Gmail has become old and bulky. Outlook is now far more sleek and user-friendly.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-07-03T06:53:56-07:00"},{"id":"10110881374","userName":"wolfesdad","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id217993906","version":"6.0.230611","score":1,"title":"Lacks basic functions of web-based Gmail","text":"Google is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, and yet they’ve never bothered to revamp their Gmail app to give users the same, basic functionality as web-based Gmail.  \n\nFor example, the Gmail app provides no formatting options other than bold, underline, and italics.  So, when composing an email, you can’t add bullet points or outline formatting.  You can’t indent.  You can’t change font size or color.  You can’t highlight or strikethrough text.  These are basic functions that the world’s most-used email app should provide.  \n\nIt’s 2023.  Google made $60 billion in net profits last year.  They obviously have the money and skill to revamp their Gmail app to give users the same, basic functionality as web-based Gmail.

Closed the app, went back less than a half hour later, every single one of my emails back to September 3rd are gone. Not in the trash, not in spam or any other folder. No customer support. No ways to get my important emails back. I’ve lost everything I needed. Editing to say no troubleshooting worked whatsoever. Emails never got recovered, and in fact more disappeared. What’s the point in having an email if you can’t even use it safely? Having no customer support for this site and app is ridiculous.\n\nUpdate:\nIt has happened twice since this review. Their “trouble shooting” does nothing. Keep your things safe. Also probably a good idea to screenshot any payments you make or orders you place for backup purposes.

I can get to my emails and have them separated so I only have to go through the ones I need. Also, sending emails is quick and easy and doesn’t require too much hassle. However, recently I have been needing to get to a certain email but gmail will not load it. Gmail only shows about half of the emails in my inbox and won’t keep loading the rest. This is very frustrating considering this has been happening consistently for the past month. I try to restart the app, restart my phone, or just get off of my phone for a bit and try again in a couple minutes, but that doesn’t fix it. The email will randomly reappear and I have no way of knowing. This bug needs to be fixed for the inconvenience it is causing.
