Instagram has gone down hill quickly since I started using it a few years ago, and now I only download the app briefly when I absolutely have to in order to message someone I don’t have another contact for. There is literally no upside, or benefit to having this app. It is designed to make you waste hours and hours and hours of your life ingesting yucky content that you can never fully filter out no matter how hard you try, and interacting in a very shallow way with your “friends” when you could be texting them, talking to them on the phone, or hanging out in person and actually building vibrant relationships. This app encourages loneliness, insecurity, and inappropriate content.

It’s not even worth interacting because you put time into commenting trying to have a conversation and instagram just removers your comment for no reason and no way to dispute it. So it’s been real but as it always happens time to move on. 

Update from my original review before- it hasn’t stopped just gotten worse. Which is wild because people can go on the comments and be super racist and hateful but breastfeeding is where you draw the line. Got it. Instagram keeps flagging all comments as spam- it’s the dumbest thing.

I made a new account a couple years back because back then I had a different one that I’ve been reported by SCAMMERS and Instagram decided to delete my account acting like I did something wrong and now I can never get my account back. I do not want to risk Instagram deleting my account again by reporting content I had up for a while, phrases I say in my story is taken too harsh at times when it’s not meant for anyone but me Instagram assumes I’m attacking people and I have screenshots of what my posts say. My friends has also been having similar issues as this and this never happened so constantly before it’s really annoying- each time I write a report to repost my content again Instagram denies it all the time so I get second opinions from multiple other people and they say the total opposite and agree to my end. I’m not the first person who is going through this please fix your stuff because people are gonna continue leaving negative reviews until Instagram takes the effort to fix stuff and closely review content before completely removing it-…. It’s very unfair for a “professional” app… I’m very disappointed I deserve my old account back plus my content that been deleted!!!!! And so do my friends who has been leaving nothing but nice comments and been getting their comments removed cuz Instagram assumes it’s scam when it’s just compliments - wow… terrible terrible very disappointed Instagram was my favorite app many years ago it got so much worse over the time, if this continues to happen I may need to not support Instagram any longer and move myself to another app and I recommend people to not be afraid and report a review for Instagram to fix its stuff.
