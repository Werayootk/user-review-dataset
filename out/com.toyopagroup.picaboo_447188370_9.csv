Nothing wrong with our app. There is so much wrong with this app. The App Store is also lying about the Snapchat Star rating cause they’ve barely had a good review in three years. The majority are one/two star so how is it 4.6? They shouldn’t be able to use reviews from years ago before they absolutely destroyed the app. This 4.6 star rating is from like 2018 reviews so it’s not really an accurate Star rating system.
