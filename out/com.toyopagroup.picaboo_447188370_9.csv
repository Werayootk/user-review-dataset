11037859521,Tawwuibk,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id345370468,12.77.0.42,1,Wrongfully banned,"I‚Äôve been an avid Snapchat user since 2013. My account meant a lot to me as I had 10+ years of memories with loved ones including those who have since passed. Earlier last year I was wrongfully banned as I posted a Snapchat of my CREATINE (workout supplement), which must‚Äôve somehow been detected by Snap AI as some other form of illegal substance, which is completely against my morals. This resulted in a permanent ban since. 

I reached out to Snapchat customer support SEVERAL COUNTLESS times since the incident, however I‚Äôm always shrugged off by their customer support team which does not consist of a single human. Their entire customer support team is full of AI who gives the same old generic responses, leading to no resolution. I‚Äôve sent at least 100 emails/inquiries within the time simply requesting a live agent because I know any human would understand my case. Ive even tried contacting them on different socials. I‚Äôve sent in multiple evidence of the fact it was simply creatine in my snap, still nothing. This really disappointed me, and this is a last resort that I hope gets the attention of a human on Snapchat‚Äôs team (if they even exist).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T15:12:16-07:00

None of us including me have ever broken any rules or guidelines. We have never used third parties or anything of the like. I have emailed snapchat and reached out only to receive nothing. I just lost years of memories, pictures, chats, friends, and streaks that were longer than 1 year. I am disgusted and honestly my heart is broken. I had photos of dead relatives on there which are now lost with no way to retrieve them. This is disgusting of you and your employees, no wonder so many people are deleting this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-12T15:00:48-07:00
