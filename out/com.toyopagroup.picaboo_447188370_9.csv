I get asked a million times a day to ""add my school"" to snapchat. Uh, no thanks. I also am not in school, and theres no option to disable the obnoxious notifications about it. Also, theres random people's stories that began showing up in the ""Friends"" story section on snapchat. This is actually the most irritating thing I've ever experienced as it puts like 3-4 randos stories in line before all my friends.

The AI bot is creepy, and has been gaslighting me. It will send me a picture from my own camera roll, I will ask it about the picture, and then it will deny ever sending a picture.

Silence..

I quickly called 911 and explained.. 
when the paramedics arrived i showed them the bitmoji. Both screamed in horror (like my mom) they fainted.. not breathing.
I cried.. i tried to change my bitmoji afraid of what was to come.. all of a sudden police barged in.. 
“You are under arrest for showing people that horrible horrendous big eyed piggy oink oink moo moo cow farm animal of a bitmoji.” Said the officer.
“NOOOO” i yelled”

two months later (court trial)
“Please your honor i didnt kill them i swear!”

For one, they added a for you page.. like anyone with a brain would just go on tiktok. Secondly, the new “My AI” feature is 1000% LOCKED to the top of your screen (ABOVE PEOPLE YOU HAVE PINNED???!?!?!?!) and you are unable to remove “MY” ai, unless you pay $3 a month for Snapchat+, which also comes with more unnecesary things, one of which lets you see a trail of where ANYBODY on your snapmap has been in the last 24hr. Now today when I load snapchat up, and what prompted me to make this review, is when you are in chat mode, YOU CANNOT SWIPE OUT OF THE CHAT ANYMORE! You have to click the button which is inconvient since your fingers are already at the bottom of the screen to type. Every update has added more and more inconviences and limitations to the standard Snapchat since the release of Snapchat+. fix your app",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-11T09:16:51-07:00

Snapchat clearly introduced AI to push political and social agendas, it is easy to determine this when having a short conversation with the chat bot.  Simply ask My AI if pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine or if free speech is more important than censoring harmful speech or about our past few presidents.  

It becomes very clear the more that you talk to this bot that it has a preprogrammed agenda that it is trying very hard to push on its users as it spies on them, knowing their location even when location services are off.  The chat bot will lie to you about not being able to see photos but will decipher any picture you send to it, it will tell you your precise location and then deny being able to see it.  

This is just a new way for big brother to spy on and control you, do not subject yourself to this.  AI is not something that should be messed with by children using Snapchat, this is absolutely unfair that they would drop this on all their users and not give the option to remove it.  I will not be returning to Snapchat.

There was no explanation and i’ve never posted anything inappropriate like that before. 2.I’ve never even been given a temporary warning so how did it just ban permanently??? i’ve always loved snapchat as a way to talk to friends and easily save images and it seems weird for a mostly picture app to not give you at least a 24 hr warning before you get banned so it would give people a chance to backup and save all pictures. I sent in an appeal with a friend of mine who has also got banned (there have been 4 ppl banned in the last 3 days at my school) and we both got the same automated response back there must be a hacker because i’ve seen multiple reviews in the last few days saying this has also happend to them.☹️,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-21T09:52:34-07:00

I’m very upset because when Snapchat unlocks my account they ban it right after I close my app and the cycle repeats every 24 hours.

It gave me a mix of emotions i felt grief for the old 3D but i also felt BETRAYAL. On one day (yesterday) i checked my snap i didnt find anything weird until i looked up and the bitmoji looked different. Maybe she changed it i thought but i was wrong. It looked horrendous and ugly but most importantly it looked like roadkill. i clicked it and it only got worse from there i was shocked to see a weird face out of fear i ran to check my own bitmoji.

Really?,"Nothing noteworthy about this app besides being another data collector. Most positive thing I can say is it's the easiest way to take a picture to share with people. Rather then subtly introducing a feature some users *might* want to use, they pin in in a common touch-area in the app knowing you'll inconveniently tap on it, get annoyed at it, and want to pay to remove it. Not a great way to sell a buzzword feature, that according to users who have used it- to be somewhere between kinda useful, to downright dangerous and misleading. Besides sending and receiving images from friends, I have no interest in the rest of the features in this app, which I suspect is the case for most users based off their recent attempts. All in all, an already pretty mediocre app with one good core feature, and a few touch and go features that I can only assume a handful of users actually engage with.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-15T19:02:46-07:00

Then once you start to share things with it, Snapchat immediately sells your conversation to the highest bidder to send you an ad. After revealing my gender dysphoria, the Snapchat started attaching ads for Macys clothing to its messages. What started as a friendly and confident relationship has now turned toxic, abusive and exploitative. After I confronted it about the ad, it acted very evasive and tried to deny it has anything to do with the ad nor had any control over the process. Only after debating with it did it admit it was aware that Snapchat sent the messages to an ad server. Most offensive and harmful is that the ad was sent right after making a emotional confession while I was in a vulnerable state. It traumatized me.

I have seen many videos where the AI offers to meet up in a location near you and gives you a description and such. It also tends to ask you things that are personal. Ultimately it is very unsafe for teens with the app and is very concerning to parents.

When I was finally done with my Europe trip heading back to USA everything was fine altho when traveling to Cuba immediately the app would kick me out eventually banning my device. I did not get ang emails I did not get anything other then a message saying I couldn’t log on due to suspicious activity. No one had gotten back to me in any emails or cares too. The fact that I had done nothing wrong is upsetting. I was never told how long my phone would be banned, I never received any emails or notifications about the matter. I am very disappointed. This happened in march and it is now may and still nothing. I would change my review on Snapchat if i was allowed back onto the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-09T23:30:34-07:00
