I started when I was in highschool, now I’m in my mid-20’s. This app doesn’t charge the seller outrageous fees, is easy to navigate through, and is perfect for anyone that’s a beginner at selling their clothes online. They make the instructions so clear and simple on how to post your clothes. The shipping guide is so nice and not confusing by any means. The messaging system is great too. I’ve tried so many other apps out there, but none of them compare to Vinted, honest truth. 

I love this app and recommend to anybody who wants to get their clothes out of the closet ASAP.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-24T00:03:04-07:00

Small packages like a 9 by 6 is .99 cents and medium packages like a 10 by 13 is 2.99.

I sold an item on Vinted to a buyer using the Vinted generated shipping label, after I shipped the item and it got delivered, the buyer claimed that she provided the wrong shipping address and Vinted cancelled the order and refunded the buyer.

The USPS tracking information shows the item as delivered, yet Vinted refunded the buyer and I just scammed out of a nice pair of boots.

When I tried to bring up the issue to Vinted support they said since the buyer claims to have not received the parcel they will not pay me for the item. 

Again the buyer provided the wrong address and I did nothing wrong as a seller, yet Vinted sided with the buyer. 

Vinted basically told me they can’t do anything about it and told me to contact USPS instead, but USPS delivered the item to the address that the BUYER provided as evidenced in the tracking and is not at fault. 

I’m shocked that in such a clear cut case of buyer error, Vinted will do nothing for the seller and refund the buyer.

A lot of people are really put off by it but apparently there’s no way to avoid it.

Customer Service insists that it’s our fault and we have to use a different card (look at the multiple Reddit and Vinted threads about it) but it’s really because THEY haven’t updated their anti-fraud systems so banks won’t allow transactions. It’s so frustrating trying to spend your money over and over again and having customer service be actually RUDE about it when it’s THEIR fault AND getting 10p taken from your account every time it fails. They HAVE to fix their systems if they don’t want to keep losing business like this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-14T22:33:44-07:00

Those are definitely apps with the Seller in mind. Vinted’s “Support” however- refuses to answer legitimate questions for help, their flagging system is super sensitive and they will not admit when they are wrong.

Countless of messages to both the seller and Vinted customer service were ultimately futile. 

Untimely the seller never shipped the item and stopped responding to messages. Later on re-listed the item I purchase.

I flagged this to Vinted customer service who instructed me to wait 10 additional business days (on top of the 1 month I had already waited), to see if the item would turn up. In that time, Vinted marked the transaction as completed and released my funds to the seller. 

Countless of raised concerns and messages to customer service resulted in Vinted saying I was out of luck and there was nothing they could do. 

Even though the history of unresponsive messages was there from the seller and clear evidence that they re-listed the same item which they never shipped to me but got paid for.

Hilarious. Apple - take note. They aren’t complying. 

Photos on white backgrounds do not automatically equal stock photos - you need to improve your AI and actually provide a way to communicate with your “team.”

Thankfully there are many credible selling sites. This one is a waste of time.

Original review: I had a listing pulled allegedly because it was a copyrighted photo. Except I 100% took the photo myself. I’d like to find out how you are supposed to sell something that is new in its box without photographing the box (I’m open to suggestions), but there is literally no way to contact anyone. I had hoped that the improvements everyone mentioned were going to make it a useful site, but the combination of a policy that makes it impossible to post a toy if it’s in its box and the inability to make an inquiry make it impractical at best.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-26T07:18:02-07:00

Solution: make sellers upload a photo of their ID (2-3 forms) ; make funds unavailable until buyer approves the item and hold the buyers funds until then. 

Deleting this app for now; I was able to buy one shirt on here that came in the mail from a seller with good reviews. There are too many fake listings to sift through.
