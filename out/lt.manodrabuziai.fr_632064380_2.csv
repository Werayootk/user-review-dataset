The only dislike is that it takes forever to sell items and when someone favorites your item and you send an offer it is not binding. This means that most people either forget about their purchase or change their mind making this extra task a minimal return of invest for the time you have to put in.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-15T15:42:04-07:00

I wish you had the option to organize your favorites into different sections, and I wish that you could sort by countries, so you are only looking at clothes from a specific country. lastly, I do not believe that you should be able to see how many stars someone gave you before you gave them stars because that can lead to someone being spiteful over a critique and giving a lower rating.

All you get is automated messages and then you are ignored. Their artificial intelligence mistakes items for something they are not, such as a candle holder. You get a message in regards to your listening being deleted and prohibited, they send u a list of items that are ok to sell and it will list candle holder as an ok item. You appeal the decision and get yet another automatic response with a persons name on the bottom stating it‚Äôs a prohibited item. Totally disregarding the fact it‚Äôs a picture of candle holders, u state it‚Äôs a candle holder and then they call u a liar and delete it. The id verification is a scam. They ask you to up load your drivers license, they verify it with a confirmation message stating it‚Äôs successful . Then two weeks later they send you a message banding your ability to withdraw your money from your wallet due to not verifying your identity. You message them and they send you automatic reply stating you didn‚Äôt verify your identity correctly. If that‚Äôs the case then why send a confirmation message saying it‚Äôs successful. To me it seems like they are scamming people and selling the personal information on the black market if they are continuing to ask for your id and social security number. I used to love this app. Now I‚Äôm going to contact lifelock and make sure they aren‚Äôt stealing my identity.
