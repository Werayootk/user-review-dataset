4744545373,07092019e,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id991768914,6.9.2,1,Frustrating when you need to reinstall,I installed the app months ago when I was asked to do so on the website and only used it to login on the website which worked ok. Iâ€™ve since had to replace my phone and reinstalled the app. NowI canâ€™t get an access code because the app asks me to scan a code from the website and the website doesnâ€™t give me an option to sign on without an access code from the app and I need to wait until Monday to speak to an admin to reset this instead of having an option to sort this out online.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=514561561&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-07T14:25:08-07:00
