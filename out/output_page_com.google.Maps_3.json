This is a pet friendly motel. We arrived and settled in for the night with our 13 year old kitty. We were in the room maybe 45 minutes tops when we couldn’t find our cat. \nFlabbergasted, we looked everywhere in the room. I then saw a big hole in the wall under the bathroom sink. We were positive that’s where he went. But where? Did he fall into a basement and was he okay?\nMy boyfriend called the front desk in despair and asked for help. The very inexperienced front desk clerk said he did not know of any hole and would be right down. After fifteen minutes of waiting, my boyfriend started walking to the motel office where he met the desk clerk. Apparently the clerk was intimidated by my boyfriend ‘s looks. The clerk called the police and demanded us to vacate the premises WITHOUT OUR CAT. I refused. The cop was on our side but had to obey the property owner. My boyfriend and the cop found a way into the subfloor of the motel and found my kitty alive and well. \nWe still had to leave with no refund. \nI have never been kicked out of a motel. I am 62 years old and am so appalled at this motels customer service \n\nWe have received a refund but it is not enough compensation. We had to drive another two hours to find a pet friendly motel.

But after trying both on a recent longer trip, I found this one less reliable in traversing large cities.  First, it suddenly asked in the middle of 5 lanes going around ATL, if “I would like to change route—they found a better one.”  I had already chosen the best one to begin with. And if so, “press this or that.” I don’t have dashboard navigation.  I rely mainly on voice commands.  My iPad mini was lying on the seat beside me, and I couldn’t see or look long enough to answer.  I was in very heavy traffic.  It should give you a voice choice response.  I’m not sure if I was supposed to press if I wanted to change, or wanted to stay the course. It gave NO time, or any warning. Just a sudden interjection.    As a result, I seem to have been taken off my original route, but couldn’t deal with it, or change lanes/course with no warning. Honestly, unless there’s a compelling reason to suddenly change course, it really just needs to shut up.  \n\nSo as soon as I could get over, I took an exit, parked at a station and changed to the Apple one.  \n\nThe other gripe I had was that there’s very little warning for turns, or to get into other lanes.  My Apple Map seems to do a better job of that. Plenty of warning.  “Go thru THIS light,” etc.  \nI still give anything this wonderful and convenient (voice navigation) 3 stars.

You could switch its place with that of the Directions button right below it. If accidentally pressed, the Directions button will not take the user away from the place of the map they are exploring. Still not ideal to keep touching it accidentally, but it shaves off about 60% of the disruption.\n\nPlease consider.

When I attempt to click the saved point on the map, I cannot select the point (and thus cannot see notes left for that point). It just creates a new point.

This seems unnecessary and easy to fix, and would add a ton of  utility to an otherwise good app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-12-01T17:54:46-07:00"},{"id":"4455748974","userName":"narayoshino","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104256222","version":"5.21","score":3,"title":"Works great on East Coast US but not so much when I’m anywhere else.","text":"I use this all the time when at my parents’ place and it gives me plenty of notice for a turn and does an overall great job navigating in New York. I’ve been using it while at my grandparents’ in West Cost US and it tells me once I’m at the turn that I’m supposed to be turning (at which point I can’t turn) and in Japan it doesn’t register where you are when trying to walk places and get directions, and we ended up making wrong turns because the map would say we were two blocks from where we actually were. Overall I use this over Apple Maps any day but it’s getting to be annoying missing turns because I can’t look at the map while driving and it tells me only once I’m at the turn to actually turn. If I was more familiar with the area it wouldn’t be a problem but I’m only here about 1 week every year and I only just started driving here because I can’t rent a car so I have to be able to borrow a car.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-07-13T13:40:34-07:00"},{"id":"3160941618","userName":"Tony.S.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id244429512","version":"4.56","score":2,"title":"Rollback (to like 10 versions back!!!)","text":"iphone 6s ios 10.\nI get smooth performance for every app, except everything google now offers! Google maps has always been so much better than apple maps and all others as well. But all these 'Everyday' updates and bug fixes have made the app sluggish. I believe we all can live with a little less features if it means just getting that smoothness back! Almost 60% of the screen space is taken by all-that-i-don't-need when i open the app. i just need the map, my current location and my destination bar!! That's it! If we need anything else, or if you think we need anything else, then just give us those options in the side menu. You should realize that most people are still using those 5-6 inch devices and not the ipads. 40% screen is not good enough for the map! and yes, we can't all have an iphone X or a pixel 2 to just get rid with the laggy UI. Understand that you can't force us to buy devices we don't need, instead we will adapt to apple maps or something else if you can't be efficient.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-09-06T13:23:30-07:00"},{"id":"9127384859","userName":"tennispetra","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1004204742","version":"6.37","score":5,"title":"Yacht getaways","text":"We took a cruise on a 52” catamaran and did the small Cyclades for a week.

My biggest gripe is that I can’t drag a route on the mobile app (on my iPhone) to get time or mileage estimates for a route I suspect will be better (because I KNOW my area’s traffic patterns-especially during rush hour times!) And choosing “avoid highways” or something else won’t help because I want a blend that includes both a )?highway then a back road. I love the drag feature on my desktop but why can’t it also be available on the mobile app? My next complaint is the inability to print directions directly from the app. My mother needs directions and being “older” (and without a smartphone, lol) she prefers having the  paper directions. If I want to do that for her, again, I have to boot up my laptop 😖 Please see if the app can incorporate these features that work so well on a desktop/laptop into the mobile app! 🙏","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-01-09T19:26:59-07:00"},{"id":"4725545301","userName":"Rach_swiftie","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114364299","version":"5.25","score":3,"title":"Wanted to like it but unreliable","text":"I almost never give “bad”reviews of something but I felt like I needed to share. I started using Google Maps more because I have been using lots of other Google apps and loved them like docs, tasks, calendar, etc. I liked them better than the Apple versions.\nSo I gave google\nMaps a try on a recent weekend trip. I knew which highway I needed to use but I needed help closer to my destination. It seemed to be experiencing some kind of error. It kept telling me to turn somewhere not the usual once or twice reminder but repeatedly for a solid minute and a half. So I ignored it, got myself to the highway I knew I needed to be on and figured it would reroute or correct but it kept doing it! I had to have Siri download another directions app and use that while I was driving because this app couldn’t get it together. I thought surely, I had selected some sort of setting that made it do that but I haven’t found anything unusual. I’m a little nervous to use it again, honestly.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-09-04T04:52:41-07:00"},{"id":"7731420107","userName":"Spiccardi","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id152321560","version":"5.76","score":1,"title":"Paid advertisement","text":"Wanted to take mass transit to get to the zoo, and the top result had me get off the subway 4 stops early to take a Lyft — only indication that this was an advertisement was given after you opted into the directions and looked at the detailed itinerary. This was my favorite map app but i cannot abide by this craven and hollow method of advertisement.\n\nUpdate: redownloaded this on a roadtrip - google maps ended up being great when we were in a car. But, I’m back in NYC, and every time I try to get directions using public transit, the map makes me go far out of my way on the subway and ends my trip with a Lyft ride. When i turn off the ‘ride share’ option for routing, the app can no longer find tenable public transit directions. It won’t even direct me 6 stops down a single subway line. When the “ride share” option turns itself back on, google is back to finding the right subway for me to take, but throws me so far out of the way that I’d need to take a Lyft, again.\n\nThis is so profoundly frustrating and absolutely kills the apps usefulness for me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-08-24T21:37:45-07:00"},{"id":"9746076916","userName":"Daisy Dub","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1287786087","version":"6.58.0","score":3,"title":"Stop changing my settings every time there’s an update","text":"Please stop changing my settings every time I update the app. I usually click update all and not look at what’s been updated.
