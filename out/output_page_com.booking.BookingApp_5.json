Booking has this tendency where you would open up the flights tab and for some odd reason it starts the calendar on the month in advance. (Ex. Its the month of February and it pulls the calendar for March). Normally I catch this and stop myself from going through the actual booking. My friend is not well and I was only able to work my job’s schedule around to see him. I rushed quickly to find a flight for him. I booked my flight with intentions of leaving the next morning. I get to the airport running back and forth from the ticket booth to the check in just to get told that I booked for the month in advance. Typically I would look away from this thing. but now just to cancel or even get a refund Im getting taxed. It seems a little like an indirect way of fooling you as if the majority of governments already do in this modern world.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-15T21:24:58-07:00"},{"id":"7646070495","userName":"EvaS1512","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1315407942","version":"29.4","score":5,"title":"Wonderful stay in the hearth of Sapareva Vanya","text":"It has been a wonderful stay for all of us and we thank for the warm welcome and personal treatment by the hosts.
