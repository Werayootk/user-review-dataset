The only reason an alternative should be presented if it saves time or equivalent reasonably - I don’t need 5 alternatives routes with options 45 mins longer. They also pop up constantly - a slower by 10 min route pops up and stays on screen until you pass it - annoying. It gets really hectic when 2-3 alternatives all equally bad - like getting off a freeway then back on only to loose 6 mins time and gain nothing but a busy screen. Also alternatives are not being informed by a traffic issue, where a detour could impart some benefit. Also - search along map doesn’t load past searches - like I have to type in-out burgers, which I’ve searched for as a stop Tom many times to count. It loads past searches nowhere in vicinity - like a stop in a different not on my route - pointless.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-04T22:31:06-07:00

I found a house that I wanted to buy. Chris said that there were a lot of things that needed to be done in the house. He wanted to introduce me to his handyman who he’d known for years and trusted thoroughly. I hired the handyman to put a lining in a fence and move a toilet and that was it the day of my move. Chris did not meet me at the house and give them the keys to the new house. All I had was a garage door opener. I drove to my house to wait for the moving van. They put everything value in my house. I went back to the other house to clean it out met the realtor there. There were multiple people who had been given access to my house that I was unaware of there had been silver left on the bottom of my walk-in closet which was still there when I got to the house I put it in my purse when I got back to the house that I had purchased and just moved into. I found the handyman that Chris Schmidt had allowed access to my house with no one there. It turned out that, someone took a large box of silver flatware from 1917 and had been in my family for five generations. It was a little under $10,000. When I had put my purse on the kitchen counter I never saw my silver coins again the handyman had come in the house, I don’t know why he grabbed a hand drill that I had on the counter and said oh it doesn’t work and then left the house. I think he came in to steal the silver out of my purse. I think I was set up it was a crime of opportunity I am old, this person should’ve never been let into my house by a realtor. The realtor should’ve given me a key to have locked the house up in the very start of the day. He didn’t do this. He left me vulnerable I can’t prove it, but I know that my silver was stolen that day, my silver flatware and my silver coins, I would never use this realtor and I would never trust a handyman who has no tools he doesn’t have a weed whacker. He doesn’t have a broom on his truck. He doesn’t have any instruments to cut anything he has nothing. He just simply shows up on his truck with his old beat up mower. There aren’t any company signs on it. There aren’t any telephone numbers and I know that this guy goes into old women’s homes, introduced by Chris to do odd jobs.
