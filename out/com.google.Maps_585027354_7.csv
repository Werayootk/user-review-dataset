I found the handyman that Chris Schmidt had allowed access to my house with no one there.

I am deeply troubled by your decision to remove Palestine from Google Maps. Innocent lives are being lost, and your actions appear to endorse the erasure of Palestine.

It is incomprehensible why such a choice would be made, and it feels like a betrayal of human rights and dignity. Know that your actions do not go unnoticed, and there is widespread outrage at this injustice.

Allah's wisdom surpasses human understanding, and justice will prevail in the end. Your actions will not go unaccounted for, and the consequences will be severe.

Sincerely disappointed,

The only problem I had was with the company itself and they had a promotion for an emergency pizza for free but to redeem it you had to buy so much other food which doesn‚Äôt make it free. It never said in there not for delivery either to which you couldn‚Äôt have it delivered. But our local people working for them are awesome.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-03T21:04:16-07:00
