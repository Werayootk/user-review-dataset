First, it is so annoying when I have to wait 5 minutes or longer to join another game because it disconnected and says I disconnected on purpose(How do you even do that?). Second, I would like it if there was a default pet that is free and a few default skins for the unlucky people who aren‚Äôt allowed to purchase them. Third, new skins, maybe some that are dresses because I have met some females that play this game and find it very sexist. Fourth, I would like it if more than one person could be the same color at the same time. Fifth, there needs to be a map update. Sixth, more skin colors. Seventh, I am very annoyed because I did not get this game before Halloween and I am not able to wear the Halloween hats and I do not want to wait till next Halloween to get them so I think you should make them available for every one who bought this game after Halloween. Finally, there should be an option in the host game menu where you can customize the amount of players and the amount of Imposters or make the player numbers go to at least 15. Other than that I think this game is amazing and I hope it stays that way.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-25T18:19:14-07:00

It has been an amazing game. But there is one problem. The new update for the anti hackers. Look I understand that this update is to prevent hackers from hacking but cmon. It has been kicking out people like crazy. One time I played among us for an entire hour and when I finally got to be the role of the imposter it just kicked me off the game saying that ‚ÄúThe game options you have been playing on are too old, you may need an update. This game needs to have another update. No body can play normally anymore. Plus, the update to ‚Äúprevent hacking‚Äù is not working. Multiple times I have entered games and not even 1 or 2 seconds in to the game someone presses the emergency meeting saying the 2 imposters. And their right. The first time it happened I thought it was luck but it kept happening in every game. Now I realize that each and everyone of those games were hackers. So this update did not do anything to prevent hackers from hacking but it destroyed my gameplay. Please developers if you are seeing this. Please respond to me saying that you guys are working on something because nobody can play the game anymore.

Features: You really need to have a friend button because you play with someone then you get disconnected and then you never see them again but, if we had a friend button we could both accept in game and if someone had to leave it would say they‚Äôre offline and then when they get online you can join there games (If its not already full). Another feature we need is game modes. We need game modes because what if we don‚Äôt want to keep playing the same old round again and again so you could add some game modes. I will list some examples, Kill out: You all are impostors and have to kill each other before someone kills you, last man standing wins. Everyone Vents: This is a game mode where you can have everyone vent, even if you are a crew mate (If you are impostor, you can‚Äôt kill in vents. 100 People: This is a game mode where servers are allowed to have 100 people in your game. There are 5 Impostors who have to kill everybody.

It‚Äôs a Game of betrayal and backstabbing. However, there‚Äôs a few suggestions and bugs I would like to point out! First of all, when I‚Äôm playing the airship map, I hear this strange noise like a hammer bashing a metal surface over and over again. It continues all the time until you restart the game. It also sounds 2x faster then a normal hammer bashing a surface, which makes it disturbing. Another bug is that, sometimes in all the maps, I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt a call meeting, I can‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm forced to leave the game.  I have a suggestion for adding a friends list. I hate it when I make an among us friend, and he or she leaves and I never see them again. I would love it if you could add them as a friend and join them again. Another suggestion is about the recent update. I know you‚Äôre trying to keep us safe by not telling any private information, but I would love to change my user name and make friends. Maybe just add a chat filter, like the game Roblox. And you also restrict some usernames. That way, we can have fun and be safe.

I think that you should think about adding a few new features. First, I personally like to play free play a lot and it would be a lot more fun if the ‚ÄúDummies‚Äù would actually play and not just stand there. I would hope that they would be smart by, being impostor, reporting, calling emergency meetings, sabotaging, completing tasks, and just overall being pretty smart. Like in other games you can hardly tell that you are playing the computer but in among us you can clearly tell the difference. Also, I like how when you are impostor and you sabotage something like electricity you can see as the impostor but not the crew mates. I do not like however how whenever you are leaving a private game with your friends which is what I do to make a new game because some of my friends didn‚Äôt join in time, you have to wait five minutes before you can play in another game. I play with my friends a whole bunch and it would be nice if that feature could be turned off.

It is very addictive, and with the reporting system they recently added, it‚Äôs been a lot better without toxic people. I have an issue, though. My friend got the game, but it didn‚Äôt let her create an account. Thus, she was stuck with the quick chat, which gave her less options. I‚Äôd appreciate it if you fixed this :). Another issue is that I made an in-game skin purchase, but I didn‚Äôt get the skin after a while of trying. This would also be appreciated if you were to fix it. But, no pressure! Otherwise, it‚Äôs an amazing game and I play it often, especially with the new map. Speaking of which, there‚Äôs also a glitch that in the beginning of a game, there‚Äôs a black screen for around ten seconds before you get loaded in. Once, I had the black screen for a while, and when it finally loaded, the game said Defeat. It was pretty funny, but a bit annoying. Another visual bug is that whenever someone is walking, their character model is blurry and looks like it had trouble loading. This happens with v-sync and without. Other than that, not much is wrong!
Overall, this is an amazing game and I like it a lot, but there are some very obvious glitches. I highly recommend it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-03T12:10:30-07:00

Overall this game is awesome and deserves five stars from everyone!

The Quick Chat was also getting annoying too because you have to look for the right word to use so they won‚Äôt vote you out. I know the Quick Chat was mad so no one could use inappropriate language. But I have a suggestion maybe there can be a way to turn the quick chat off. And block out all the inappropriate language so  no one will be able to see that . It‚Äôs better to explain with your own appropriate words instead of using the quick chat. I thought it will be fun to have levels. For an example your level get higher depending on how many games you won and how many task you have completed. It would also be cool to unlock new skins whenever you unlock a new level, instead of using your own money to buy skins . I like changing my name sometimes but with the new update I could not change it. Maybe there could be a way to change your name and to not to be able to write inappropriate names.  The main problem was the Quick Chat  and the name changing, the others were suggestion. If those problems get fixed I probably will download it again.

But one thing I don‚Äôt really like about it is when you have the ‚Äú sensor chat on‚Äù you still have people saying words that aren‚Äôt necessarily bleeped out. For example: names. Also, I think you should have a few outfits/ costumes free. I definitely recommend adding a baby costumes without any legs. Also like added a baby to the front of the character. I think that would be cute. Maybe add some more colors like a light purple or a teal/ turquoise, etc. I love anonymous voting. I also think you should add more hats. I also really like the angle hat, but I can‚Äôt get it because my parents don‚Äôt like to spend money on those types of things. I understand why it costs money, but I really like that angel hat. I also don‚Äôt like it when people put the speed to SUPER slow. Like why-? Also SUPER fast gives me a headache. Keep it to a normal speed. Another good idea I had is to make it more 3D. Like have a button for you right hand and go down into first person or something like that. Anyways, it‚Äôs a really good game and it so trendy! Keep up the great work!  #needmoregameslikethis!

People have to wait 33 mins before entering the game completely and I find that a little...long? Unimpressive? Maybe shorten the wait time to maybe 5 or 10 mins because I'm sure people wouldn't want to wait 33 mins to get back into the game so maybe shorten the time just a bit? Overall I am glad to see the game has finally updated, it's good to see all you can do and finally wear without paying like before. I like the new loading screens when you get into the game and how they tell you what ""role"" you are. Brings a little more excitement to it. All I ask is maybe change the wait time when disconnected from the server so you won't lose people playing. Im sure if people were playing with friends and disconnected to buy hats or other stuff with the new paying method wouldnt want to wait 33 mins to get back to their friends and play. Please take my opinion into consideration as I think this will make the game lose interest and if you lowered it Im sure people would still keep playing!

It takes too long to put in what you want to say and I can‚Äôt even say half the things I want to. One thing I liked about public lobbies was getting to know the other players.

One suggestion I would make is having the option to turn that feature off since I do still think it‚Äôs great for kids about 10 and under, it‚Äôs pretty useless to the rest of us tho lol. Or maybe a feature that sensors chat before you send the message in order to avoid inappropriate people. Although I don‚Äôt like the chat very much I am very happy with the new airship map!

However, it has some problems to be fixed! Many reviews have already mentioned these: suggestions of friend requests, issues with being kicked, issues with not being able to kick, etc. One of the biggest issues I face while playing the game is the amount of people who simply leave mid-game. When the game first starts, usually two people leave right away. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because they got crewmate and wanted impostor but it could be something else. Then, some people will play as groups and as soon as one of their groups gets killed in the game, they all leave. It‚Äôs not fun when 6 people leave at once and you‚Äôre left with four people, two of which are impostors. It makes the game impossible. I‚Äôm not sure how to fix this rather than creating some sort of time-out time for leaving in the middle of games. On the other hand, I have gotten disconnected from the game quite a few times so this could be happening too, but I do think quite a few people just leave mid-game because they can. It really prevents people from being able to play a complete game and I haven‚Äôt played a good game in days because of this issue.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-30T19:26:55-07:00

I am going to start with the game. The game itself is really nice but there are people trying to ask for relationships as if it was a dating app and many people are using cuss words and inappropriate language which may not be appropriate to other people. Apps like roblox have had the chat made like this. They have the chat just fine, but if someone does a typo or tries to tell their personal info or they are trying ti say cuss words then they automatically put hashtags instead of the word. Also, its annoying to try and join a server when it keeps saying its full or it already started. Now to the people who play it. The people on there are either sick or they are just doing it on purpose. People are flirting, glitching, and they are extremely dumb. This gives proof that these people must have been playing video games a lit and they have eventually become dumb by the second. If you want this app to increase in downloads and not decrease then fix this stuff to fit the parents approval.

There are also a lot of mean and toxic people in the community I want the game to have an automatic censor on the bad and racist words that are said and please add like a voice chat or something on this because then people can talk to each or hate and say what they say. I love this game but my biggest concern is that community because all they do is curse and say the meanest things to one another there are kids playing the game and there are those who ruin the game by saying mean this to the kids who play this game please fix the community it is so toxic there is also A LOT of racism in the game and there is a lot of hurt in the words people say to one another and people need to think twice before they say what they are going to say. The community also needs to STOP using this game to date and getting close to one another it is so annoying I hate this please just kick these people out of the game who ruin it for the people who actually play this game the good way and not in a bad way.

Also I want a friend button like when someone found a body you can click on anyone and it will give you options to vote or send a friend request and then on the menu you can view your friend list, and even search names too, I saw this really nice guy who was the only person I trusted and then my game crashed :( (that‚Äôs why I want a search for friends thing so I can find that nice guy again lol), That would be amazing.

Or here‚Äôs another idea: you could go to the settings and just take the button that says sensor chat and just delete it.

Part of this update was to go to your parents and ask for permission when the kids (probably) asked already to get it. The quick chat option just to put it out there it stinks. It still lacks variety, and it limits your opinions to say what you saw! Also now people have to give some private information like their debit/credit card numbers, or let‚Äôs say you give the last 4 digits of your social security card that will make people very sus of innersloth. Honestly at least make it were we can go back to the old days without all of the new restrictions! Having the report player will be great and can make it that it‚Äôs safer for the younger players without going thru the struggles of all the new stuff. You can make it were that you rank how bad they are and get them banned for a few days, and give everyone a free account that if they pay they can get a better upgrade to their account.

The new map is big, which I enjoy but there‚Äôs some glitches/problems I have with it and many others seem to too. The doors in electrical can open RANDOMLY which is confusing to many and no one really seems to like it, the new chat rule causes a LOT of misinformation/miscommunication and you can barely say anything that you need to say. Again with the map, the random overhangs (I forgot the name) are really confusing and people can barely get from room to room without walking into walls and going into the wrong room because of an entrence you can‚Äôt even relize is there. With the older version before this, some glitches that I don‚Äôt like (the glitches are still here) are that it randomly votes fo you when you vote for one person, when let‚Äôs say it says 2/10 when u go on it it says it‚Äôs full with EVERY SERVER but it keeps showing up, there are many others but I don‚Äôt have the time to state them but these are also the first that come to mind but because of these things many people have already grown off of Among Us just from the last update.

They should allow discord cheating, this discord cheating is pretty bad, the imposters won‚Äôt have a chance. Probably the discord cheating goes away, we just need to play the game fairly just like other people. Support among us and play this game for fun.

These players who slurs make players don‚Äôt feel like a person anymore, they can also may quit the game or may feel down. These players who discord cheats, those imposters have a disadvantage of winning and it will ruin the fun of the other players. Hackers, They are just seeking attention, if there is a hacker.

Before they left they said they really wish they could friend request me and I agree.  I think you should be able to send friend requests to people and if you accept there would be an area where you could see your different friends (they‚Äôre avatar and name would also be there), and you would have the option to see if they‚Äôre in a game and if they are there could be a way to click them or something and it would bring you into the same lobby as them if it isn‚Äôt full.

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. 
There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. 
I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9. This needs to be fixed ASAP.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-10T06:55:44-07:00

I do have a small issue with the game, and that would be the new Quick Chat feature. I understand that it carries the purpose of safe chatting in mind for minors, however, with that said, the chat becomes less cohesive and extremely limited. When I say less cohesive, I mean people are pressing random choices for words, and it‚Äôs very hard to communicate where communication is key in this game. Making the chat choices limited also proves to be a little of a hassle when you have specific words you want to say (for example: ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù Or just other simple words like ‚Äúhi‚Äù ‚Äúbye‚Äù and maybe funny stuff that‚Äôs specific to your personal humor). Oh, now that I think about it, I also seem to be noticing glitches/bugs in the Polus map, although I don‚Äôt know if you are already trying to fix that or not, as it is quite noticeable and is not only a visual bug.

It‚Äôs super fun to play and is a great way to take up your time. I think it‚Äôs good that they have a chat censor so that little kids can‚Äôt see someone cuss or say something inappropriate in the chat. There are no ads at all which makes this game different from others because many games have ads but Among Us doesn‚Äôt and I am grateful for that. There is just a couple glitches but I know that the developers are working hard on that. This game definitely deserves 5 stars but I have a couple suggestions if you will please take these into consideration. My first suggestion, add some music options! Many apps are better if you could choose your own music or maybe unlock the by doing achievements. For example, ‚ÄúUnlock bop-bop-bop music by finishing 100 tasks.‚Äù Or something like that. Also, please please PLEASE add mini-games. Mini-games or different game versions would be such a cool twist to this game.

The next day, I opened among us again, but this time it crashed before I could even get in. Went out of the app and back, same thing. I asked a friend to check this for me, and she said hers was working fine. I then updated the app. Same thing. Deleted and downloaded. Same thing. Shut down the device. Same thing.

It‚Äôs really unique, has a fun art style, is filled with loads of Easter eggs, and is really easy to pick up, but takes lots of practice to be good at. It‚Äôs really fun, and I love that you can change the rule settings to make the game more suitable to your preferences. However, on that note, I would really appreciate it if you could search for games with specific rule sets. For example, I would be able to specify that I only wanted to play games with player speeds under 2x. Also, I think it would be fun if, in the settings, you could turn on and off things like the task bar, vents, and certain crises. Finally, I would like a more organized system that decides whether or not you are the impostor in a game. For example, for every game you play as a crew mate, your chances for being impostor on the next game increase. I think this would help solve the problem of all the annoying people that join a game, and then leave as soon as they find out that they are not an impostor. Overall, this game is amazing and I think InnerSloth deserves all of the attention they are getting from it and more.

I‚Äôve been playing for a month after I‚Äôve heard a lot about it and how trendy it is. Though there are some bugs that causes you to disconnect and where your screen is black and your unable to move. Some more things they should improve is to allow more than 10.. at least 15, and no more because the servers might not be able to handle lots of players. The votekick system needs to be improved and especially the bots and hackers. Other than that I love the game! 

I‚Äôve also heard rumors of voice chat, and I would like that to not be implemented due to amount of toxicity and disrespectful players. It should only be  available to the imposters so they could talk about strategies to help them win. You might think it‚Äôs unfair but I believe it is not, it makes more sense. If possible you add voice chat for imposters than it would make sense that there will be a mute button. 

There should also be a new map possibly? Though I don‚Äôt really care too much since I play on skeld most of the time haha.

Also with the no chat thing people can't ask advice or for help , friendships can't form in this game anymore and that is really really really sad . The people that would be bothered by the very few people who actually are toxic , are in the huge minority. This is mainly parents who are overprotective of their young kids / parents who don't understand that some people are messed up and that their child will have to deal with that some time or later . Anyways back on topic I just think that this game was much better before the restriction updates and would love if those could be lifted . Thank you taking the time to read this and have a good day .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-25T21:02:28-07:00

I play it every single day and I absolutely love it. However, the community and players are so awful. Hackers and toxic people always come and ruin the game :/  I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how many times I‚Äôve left a game because someone‚Äôs hacked it and killed everyone at once, or controlled my character‚Äôs movement, controlled what I say (such as ‚ÄúRed is The Impostor.‚Äù, or something like that). For the toxic people, there‚Äôs always someone throwing around slurs or just generally being inappropriate and rude. I have gotten DEATH THREATS on here because I voted them out. Then there‚Äôs the kids who throw around the n word, f slur, and r word. All because of a GAME. There‚Äôs no control of the community. Yes, there is a censored chat but it doesn‚Äôt stop much. Death threats, slurs, and other harmful things like that can really affect someone. I would be giving this game five stars if these issues were actually dealt with. Please consider finding a way to restrict hacking and saying slurs. And I‚Äôd suggest to especially consider having a report button (mostly for the death threats) so that a user‚Äôs app on that device can be banned for something as horrible as that.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-23T06:03:00-07:00

7204215421,Acarinix,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1117265191,2021.3.31.2,4,Great game but a few ideas on the new updates,"I like this game a lot and it's really interesting to have to make up alibis and try new strategies but there are few things that take away from the entertainment value. First of all, the quick chat feature makes it hard to communicate with other players so it's hard to get involved in a scenario where players actually have to make solid arguments. Ive noticed that avid players have started playing less since the feature was added because there simply isn't the same amount of excitement when half the lobby can't even respond with anything other than basic details. The second problem I see in the game is on the new spaceship map. Unlike in the previous maps, the meeting room only has one point of entry. Although more than one person is able to climb on a ladder at the same time, the imposter could easily guard the top of the ladder and prevent crewmates from pushing the button. Guarding the button can be a good strategy at times but on all the other maps, there have been multiple directions that the table can be reached by which increases the chance that a crew mate could be able to escape the imposter by calling a meeting.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-09T18:12:24-07:00

My friends and me would play everyday and it was super fun! But the second the airship came everything changed. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still play the game and airship is such a fun map! But the quick chat situation isn‚Äôt the best. I honestly don‚Äôt get the point of it. Because if you make an account you don‚Äôt have to use the quick chat from my understanding. On my phone and computer it never lets me make an account, always saying either ‚Äúfailed‚Äù or ‚Äúyour Apple ID cannot be used to make accounts for other apps‚Äù so I‚Äôm stuck using quick chat. Which makes it extremely hard to talk and engage with other people. It also gets me voted out for no reason. Every single game I‚Äôve joined since the quick chat update, nobody even talked, they just voted and the imposter always won. I don‚Äôt see the point in playing with quick chat, it‚Äôs not fun and there‚Äôs no point in even playing. If I was able to actually make and account it would be fine. But the fact that I can‚Äôt even make my own name is also very annoying. In my opinion getting rid of the whole ‚Äúaccount‚Äù thing would make this so much more enjoyable. no quick chat, letting people name themselves, etc. Love the game though! :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-17T18:25:18-07:00

I know that you guys are trying to please everyone and fix tiny bugs in the game. I recognize that and realize how much work that is and I respect that. Because of that, it isn‚Äôt mandatory that you take these suggestions but please at lease read them. I know that the idea of the update fixes the cussing and hackers problem but It isn‚Äôt the best solution. Instead, a better idea is whenever you cuss, you are kicked from the game. Then it is enjoyable and you can still chat easily. I just wanna be able to chat easier.

UPDATE: I think that the latest update was a great idea. Now, you can report someone for bad language or being rude. I just have one suggestion: I know that coding a game is complicated so I understand if you can‚Äôt do this, but can you please somehow make it so imposters aren‚Äôt afk, or even better, there are no afk players. I think a way you can do this is if the player doesn‚Äôt touch the screen or do anything active for a certain amount of time, it automatically kicks them. It‚Äôs just a couple suggestions though.

And although there‚Äôs some up downs you have to remember innersloth is a small team and most importantly takes time to make major updates like this as THE AIRSHIP which I think they did a outstanding job at this map I mean compared to the first map not that it‚Äôs bad cause actually that was the only map I would usually use before airship came out. It‚Äôs just the airship compared to the skeld has a huge difference and I can see the maps getting more intense and better as innersloth improves there skill. And my opinion is if your going to add a 15 player lobby which 5 new colors then I would only make it were you half to be using the airship map to have a 15 player lobby because the other maps are a little to small for 15 players and the airship is kinda a big map a good size for that like airship map was made for 15 player lobby‚Äôs. And I don‚Äôt think you should add 4 imp because that‚Äôs just to many and it‚Äôs not fun playing white 3 imp in a 10 player lobby and I think 3 imp is PLENTY for even 15 players I hope you liked my review and I hope you use my advise for the game :) .,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-03T10:25:49-07:00

I wanted a game I could open up and play, but now I have to log in every single time I open the app, or else I cannot use free chat and can only use quick chat(why is this even a thing in the first place) In my experience quick chat Is a waste of time, nobody uses real user names only colors, nobody has the time to go through each option to click 8 times before they get voted out or voting time ends. They also have a horrible bug where you cannot move and are stuck from the start unless you click the settings first and then it unfreezes you so you can start the game. They have had so many bugs and I think they need to stop adding new things acting like it‚Äôs making their game better when it‚Äôs just creating more new bugs that we have now realized will not be fixed.

Okay so, almost every time you join a game someone joins and then the game goes pitch black. Then in the chat, I guess it‚Äôs a bot or something but it says either ‚Äújoin the discord server (and the link)‚Äù or ‚ÄúJoin the discord server or your phone will be hacked (then the link)| Hacked by Russians‚Äù or something like those things but to me, I feel like the game isn‚Äôt safe anymore. 
I hope you guys can fix this because this game is so cool and popular then nobody will want to play it again. I love this game but it seems now that no one is able to play it.
Another thing is when the hacker joins the games, sometimes you will get disconnected, or it says ‚ÄúThe Among us matchmaker is full. Please try again in a few minutes.‚Äù, and sometimes it will say ‚ÄúCheck your internet connection strength.‚Äù, but it will have nothing to do with your internet. 
Please fix these things because this game will start losing its popularity and people will want to stop playing it. I hope safety for everyone! <3",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-24T12:33:35-07:00

I‚Äôm getting blocked from playing when I opt out of too many matches, this is a really silly rule in the fact that I probably opt out of 20 games a day or more, this results in the denial of playing time for five and then ten minutes at a time. My reasons for opting out are simple, people are weird, they do stupid things and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable. I should be able to leave a game whenever I want for whatever reason I want any time with no problem, but no, you guys feel the need to block me for five and then ten minutes because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable playing with the audience that I joined. I understand your reasoning though, your goal is create matches where everyone joins and plays fairly without too many people leaving to make the game not fun but this rule is silly and not necessary for games because people opt out anyway with no regard and it effects those who would just like to play with the right crowd. 

Thank you for your time and please make the adjustment so that we can play with the right crowd without silly punishments.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-03T12:58:27-07:00
