When the driver came the app would not allow her to take off without a passcode. I love the security feature but right on the spot right after the ID upload was overload for me. I just didnt know about it ahead of time. I hadn’t used the app on over a year when i logged back on yesterday and got a ride it didn’t ask anything so i wasn’t prepared to be asked those things the second day when i had my important appointment. The first day i was not in a rush and it would have been appropriate to upload my ID. 
In the future it would be best to ask for id identification when the first ride take place then the client won’t be thrown off with the following rides. 
I understand and agree with asking for the passcode each time for safety. I don’t know mine and was just happy she was able to use my last 4 of my phone number.

On gentleman, who is older, and obviously in poor health (as he is a dialysis patient) who has requested rides and been ripped off more than once.  Once they cancelled his ride, left him unable to get here for his treatment, and once they pulled up, called him, and he was sitting in our lobby ready to go.  He walked out the door and the car was driving away.  He shouted and flagged the guy down, and surprisingly the driver stopped, but rather than providing the service that was paid for, the driver said “I have another trip” and drove off, but still charged him.  Another patient had an Uber that had arrived, but he was bleeding from his access, so I went out to tell the guy what was happening and asked him to wait another 5 minutes, and he was pulling away.  I yelled for him to stop, which he did, but he informed me that he wasn’t going to wait.  I’m not sure if that patient was refunded.  These people are on a fixed income, and their treatments are keeping them alive. I realize it’s business, but if there’s no service provided they shouldn’t be charged, definitely not full price.

However, he still dropped me off at the correct destination. The only way I could complain about this hinderance post-trip was by tagging my 3/5 star rating with the “Communication Issues” review choice in-app. If a comment box like the one on your App Store download page existed in the Uber app, it would make life easier for riders and drivers alike in terms of expressing specific rider concerns.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-26T04:52:11-07:00

The first few times I used Uber were great.
Then one day I waited in vain for a ride home from pharmacy. I waited for the initial time and then tried contacting by putting in where I was standing, what I was wearing and asking car info. Never received a reply. I said there were several cars who had a driver if they would tell me. I got a reply, “I’m here.” Still no car description. I waited longer to report a problem then found out there wasn’t a way to do it. Then I got a notice the ride was canceled! The next driver would turn shoulders around to speak with me in the back seat. That was unsettling. 
I used Uber to drive to an appointment. When I got in the driver said, “Put on your seat belt.” That was it. The floorboard needing vacuuming for leaf debris. He drove fast so had to brace around turns. He saw yellow light and gunned it going through when it was red. The route was the worst possible. Older roads, bumpy, rutty,  many lights and longer. He was not interested in my input about a simpler, faster route that wasn’t so hard on wear and tear. This driver was not friendly and he brought serial killers to mind.

Then when I place the order, it spends 3 minutes finding a car, and then tells me it will be 16 minutes to get there. Then the car is often late to arriive or sometimes doesn’t even bother driving towards me. So I end up canceling and calling a cab which comes in 5 minutes.

Secondly, this app drains the phone battery quickly. A suggestion would be to allow maps/navigation to route even while the phone is “locked.” Doing so would be more convenient and in the process not drain battery. Thirdly, when a customer sends a message, the message stays on the screen and keeps on popping up hindering the view for the navigation.

The issue with prices has to do with the way in which drivers manipulate the system. They figured out how to turn off their app, find areas where other drivers have done the same thing, and then turn it on knowing the price will be higher due to “fewer” drivers in the area. In Seattle this is a huge problem. Something Uber has failed to address. In fact, recently I found myself actually using Lyft because they tend to have much lower prices yet also have a similar awesome app that makes finding a driver so easy. 

No matter the case, Uber’s customer service is excellent and they remain a contender against Lyft. But unless they figure out a way to lower prices, it’s hard for me to say which service I’ll use more often. After all, $10 for a 1.7 mile ride is very steep - the same (or more) than using a Taxi.

   Super-time saving when you request the Uber Pickup before going inside the car repair building,  By the time Uber finds a driver to send for pickup you verifying your contact information, negotiate a  pick-up time, and hand over the keys. Walk to where you want picked up and click the location on the map. Flash memory the license plate and the characteristics of the car then sit down and take a breath 
    The Uber driver will arrive reasonably quickly.  The tracking map lets you know when to be ready for pickup at a location safe for your pickup and allow the driver economy after dropping me off.

As understanding as that can be at times, when it comes time to communicate with uber about it, it’s hit or miss. Sometimes they get you squared away with a refund or rerun no problem. Other times you get the third degree from a person operating strictly from a script and it’s this script usage that causes the real problems.

I confirm the trip thinking the price I was quoted will be the price I pay, +\- a dollar or two for some random toll or whatever. No, I went back to check my receipt to find out I’ve been charged more than 2x the originally quoted price. If you’re quoted $32, you expect to pay around that much. To be charged $70+ without your permission is criminal! Back when uber pool was still functional I’d hear customers get in the car, make changes to where they were going etc, which makes sense to change things after your ride has been set, but if you get in the car & say hi & nothing else, not requesting other routes, why are we being charged more than double? The first time it happened I let it slide... 2nd time, eh it’s a pandemic so fine. 3rd time?! I’m honestly about to report it to my credit card company as fraud. Uber used to be such a great app but I’ve seen much more shady behavior over the past year. Completely disappointed. You guys lost me as a customer tonight and will continue to lose more after people catch on.

5449278058,jkg245,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id565771055,3.387.10004,1,Lack luster an down right sad,I have had uber for id say two years now. With in my two years of using this service i find it very unreliable. Uber has drivers who get the notification to pick someone up not move at all. Then when you cancel uber expects you to pay a fee. Then there is the “money holding” claiming that its to make sure the person has the funds an never pay it back. Iv waited and not harassed uber about this but for twenty one days of waiting for my money to be returned an still not have it is a grave insult to me on a major level. Uber has wasted my time plenty of times an has kept using incompetent driver that cant do the job they choose to do. Granted iv met some pretty amazing drivers who take their jobs very seriously. I feel its a shame they work for such a shady company that doesn’t even care about its customers. I find it very shady for a company to be around for years an still to this day not have a customer service number on record. But thats be a lie they do have one but sadly its only for drivers how convenient. But I digress iv made it my point to write this an make people aware that this could be how you will be treated as well. As for me ill be having this app uninstalled an have my card block uber i hope everyone has a amazing day.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-25T19:10:55-07:00

He drove us through weird streets in the OPPOSITE direction (15 minutes away) from our drop off location. He sat there for 5 minutes looking at his phone, then tried kicking us (my friend and me) out of his car (the driver barely spoke English so it was hard to communicate.) We told him he should honor his mistake and drive us directly to our initial drop off location, but he refused and YELLED at us! My friend and I finally got out of the car because at this point we were in that spot in his car for 10 minutes. He was being rude and greedy yelling at us to order the ride again but we refused. He left us there STRANDED. When I had first requested pool, the amount said $5.99. When I got out of his car, Uber had charged me $9.29! I contacted customer service and told them about my issue and experience, and they refunded me $2!!! I had to message them again stating I wanted to be FULLY reimbursed before they did something about it. Untrustworthy drivers and poor customer service. Use LYFT instead. A lot more friendly drivers and customer service is excellent!

When I initiated my pick up from Uber, my ride was 12 min away. It also said it was in the area making another a drop off in my area before coming to my location for pick up. So I patiently waited. I notice that my drivers location was getting closer to mine. But then from 12 min it changed to 15min and from 15min to 17min. The time changed again once more to 15min. It was at 15 min for a good 20min. I noticed that the drivers location on the map was not moving. I zoomed in and noticed that he was parked in the near by Walmart’s parking lot. At this point I messaged the driver and asked if he was on his way, and mentioned to the driver that I see that he hasn’t moved in quite some time now. The driver never replied back, but started to move on the map right after I sent it, indicating that he got my message. At this point I’m waiting again, but realize that he has gone to another location away from mine. Not only did the driver waste my time, I also missed going to the cook off because it was too late. I had to cancel my Uber ride and my plans for that night. This is the second time I’ve had a bad experience with Uber. I should’ve learned from the first time and quit using Uber.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-22T18:10:47-07:00

As soon as she dropped the guy off she ended my trip and im like what!? I need to get to my destination she said you need to contact uber she literally kicked me out her car i told her no it was misnight i wasnt going to get off in a dark small street. After that she got another uber request and started driving towards burbank (my destination was panorama city) i kindly told her please the least you can do is either take me back home or to my destination . I showed her my phone where it pinned my destination. She ignored me after that she got on the freeway and i told her please just get off on the first exit and just leave me in a big street where theres people passing by (this was at 12:30am) she said she couldnt i started freaking out untill she did . I asked her again to please just take me back home or to where i needed to go and she refused again . She left me in the middle of burbank stranded . I contacted ubed support and they didnt care either. Uber and the uber drivers dnt care about your safety.

This way I wouldn’t have to keep refilling while we were away on vacation. I was totally excited to learn about Uber’s new family plans for teens since I have 2 teenage sons. However, my credit card got charged every time the youngest used the service and my Uber Cash remained untouched. So, I deleted the credit card so that my Uber Cash would be used first. Well guess what. Uber Cash will not be applied to family rides (their policy fine print). My son was almost stranded at a school football game. Fortunately, another family called an Uber for him. Then the app bombarded me with a message to add the credit card back in. I reached out to Customer Support immediately. I wanted to know how to transfer the money onto my family account. What a waste of time!!  Clearly their representative was unfamiliar with the policy and was unable to fix the situation. REALLY Uber! I thought that I could trust your company to take care of my kids transportation needs since you claim to do so. No more business with you!

The card is worth 10$ and no matter how much it is (let’s say $9) I have a 50¢ fare STILL. I have tried charging this fare to numerous payment methods, cash card, credit card, bank card, paypal, nothing. I contacted uber about not being able to use ANY payment or my gift card. The response i got disregarded all my questions and told me to add another payment because a payment was linked to an account that owes money. I more assertively asked exactly what payment method because there is only my bank card connected at the moment which is brand new and barely used, also that i never owed a dime of another account. I said if i cant use my gift card to refund it. The response i got didn’t answer what method, only that gift cards are non refundable, and to talk to the account holder *john appleseed*. I am not going to continue being blatantly ignored, today i opened a paypal case, my account is in good standing so i have no doubt i will get a refund. Lets say someones account did owe money and i added a payment on it, why should that stop me from using a gift car I already purchased?

How extremely unprofessional and downright deceptive!!

With someone on the ride who just ate. My frustration with this app has what feels like no end sometimes with the constant price updates (always charging me more for a ride without warning or explanation of why my price increased), a lot of drivers not matching the description of the vehicle or themselves, the issues with proper locations sometimes, lack in actual available customer service/support,don’t get me started with how many times Uber and Uber eats have both charged me for rides never taken food never delivered etc. while only receiving a credit unwanted and unneeded.. the list goes on…. I’m not gonna bore everyone with details right now but this is why I am giving this rate after over 3 years of app use as well as removing my account entirely. This company clearly doesn’t care and isn’t concerned about its consumers so I’ll be happy to take my business elsewhere and set more time aside for myself to handle things old school.
