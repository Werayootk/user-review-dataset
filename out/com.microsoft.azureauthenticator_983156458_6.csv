Despite this Microsoft has without a doubt one of the most obtuse login workflows I have seen date. Utilizes complexity as a security feature at the cost of usability to the point that when one thing goes wrong, you are waiting 30 days to get back in to any account.

It’s so difficult to get set up and after using it for a while it will only let you log in after getting it authenticated from the app (which for me is on my phone, so if I’m in class I still have to have my phone which is super frustrating). I also got logged out of the authenticator app on my phone and in order to get logged in I had to approve it from the app which is impossible when you’re not logged in. Extremely frustrating and inconvenient.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-28T19:48:59-07:00

I have wasted 4 years of my life with this app, the only reason being, my organisation uses this Authenticator for securing my laptop. I thought “why not use the same app for all my personal accounts too” and ended up using this garbage. 

The account won’t sync to the iCloud if you buy a new device. You ll have to waste your precious time configuring the same. Backup is a joke. Needless to say no support for the Apple Watch too.  I have moved to authy and I loved it already.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-28T18:35:33-07:00
