As a tech admin for a school district I’m constantly adding computers/laptops and have to authenticate many times a day, and it’s so much easier when I can just tap it on my watch because I don’t always have my phone out or able to get to it as fast. Please bring it back for my watch and I’ll gladly change to 5 star.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-06T10:19:44-07:00

The Watch interface made it tolerable. I could leave my phone in my office and still get logged on in every classroom. Now we go backwards again.

Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I recently switched my devices and getting my with tokens transferred to a new device is all manual process.

In fact, you won’t even be able to log into your own email!

This piece of junk (no surprise, just like most other Microsoft products) not only locked me out of my email, but I am currently missing deadlines while waiting on “support” staff to find a solution. Easy solution. I have a password that I created to securely log into my email. Maybe, just maybe, that should give me access to what I have paid good money for!

False.

Microsoft has its head shoved so far up its own behind that they can’t even provide email service without screwing the pooch.

Way to go Bill!

How this piece of junk has 4.8 stars is beyond me. This provides no better security than Apple’s keychain.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-09T22:56:23-07:00

They make it so difficult for you to login somethings so simple and it doesn’t let you recover anything after it doesn’t let you login. Microsoft is the worst company ever

And the stupid thing is is that it wants me to verify on the authentication app (this) when im on this app trying to log in after I put my password correct. Even after I put it it wants me to verify.

But I was having trouble accessing my outlook account when I got a new phone. So I went into settings and trying to get the backup by turning on backups but that created a new backup and erased my actual backup from my old phone! And there was no way to access the old back up. So now I have to remember which services I was using 2FA with and go through the painful process of resetting all of them again!!!
