In the past I’ve used ”glamping” sites and ”Flipkey,” and I’ve had amazing experiences in those stays, but AirBnB’s listings have afforded me the luxury of staying at unique homes I’d never have the opportunity to stay at otherwise. I’m a writer and artist, and the landscape and tranquility of these spaces, inspired some of my best work. Whether I stay a short walking distance from my campus, or needing a spur of the moment mindfulness staycation,I’m an unwavering fan. I hope they continue to improve- find a medium which is beneficial to not only those who share their space or host, but to guests looking for the 5-star service we all enjoy.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-20T22:02:04-07:00

AirBnB charged a 15% fee. In the middle of the pandemic, as a group of physicians, we decided the risk was too great so we decided to cancel. Rather than wait till close to the reservation time I chose to see if we could cancel early so it could be rebooked by someone not concerned with the risk. The host was excellent and refunded our money. Trying to contact AirBnB about how to do that and if they’d be willing to do likewise with their high fee was a real exercise in patience. It took WEEKS to get even an initial response by email. Despite an appeal, they did not refund the high fee. The place was re-booked within a few weeks so the only person to lose in this arrangement was me - even though I tried to do the best thing for everyone. 

AirBnB has poor customer service, particularly in light of their ridiculously high fees for little value. They’re simply interested in raking in money using the resources of their hosts.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-19T06:37:40-07:00

Date Clarity- For example, based off my first experience with using Airbnb yesterday and today, it is really confusing if your not familiar with the app: (for me at least)  
So I would really suggest adding Labels to the dates. For example say you book a place from November 21- November 22, that’s what I did. And I was under the impression that I payed for 2 nights, and that I would check out on November 23rd. Well apparently not. It’s for one night, and you check out the next day. So when I found out I only paid for one night, it was quite a let down. My siblings were so angry, as they thought they we paid for 2 nights. So I’d suggest putting green for the dates you want, and red for checkout dates. 

Dark/ light mode for sensitive eyes 
Accessibility  features for VI. As a visually impaired person, it would truly be great to have filters. And bigger text. Maybe even text to audio. Because on Samsung the accessibility feature aren’t the greatest 
And that’s all of the changes and improvements I have for now. I hope all of you fellow app developers take some of these into consideration, and I hope I get to see some of these added sometime in the future.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-22T15:35:40-07:00

If there are a lot of homes to choose from this makes it difficult. They don’t post the name of the city on the first picture of the home where the title is. You have to click on that home and then you can see the city name. It wastes a lot of time while choosing a place. Also I don’t like that the price can display on the front page so inaccurately.

Been a host and a guest over 300 times since 2014. My ONLY issue with Airbnb is the customer service (it was good back in 2014, only deteriorated the past couple years).

However, that one issue is so significant, that I’ve completely stopped hosting. Airbnb doesn’t protect its hosts. I had one guest repeatedly break the house rules (the rule he continued to break endangered myself & my 2 other Airbnb guests). When I asked Airbnb to ask him to leave (bear in mind, I let it go with a verbal warning the first time it happened) they refunded his money and said it was because I canceled. When I wrote back saying I didn’t cancel, he violated house rules and caused a safety issue, Airbnb’s customer service responded saying it’s not a safety issue, it’s a “personality” issue.

Well, as a host, I made rules that protected my home and the people in it. Airbnb has guests read and accept these rules prior to booking. This guest did read and accept, then he broke the rules twice. Airbnb penalized me for it. Not him. 

Airbnb’s customer service team doesn’t care. They pluck responses from a drop down menu and don’t bother to use their brains and/or any empathy.  As a guest, sure, use Airbnb.

We arrived to find the elevator was down, had been for 3.5 weeks, which the Host knew and confirmed. Then the host threw me into the abyss of AirBNB non-customer service.

AirBNB offered no help. Sure they suggested a few other places, all of which had stairs and were not served by an elevator or matched up to what we had rented. 

AirBNB quit responding to my request to help, I had to demand the host get us a hotel room and then I started the process to find a new place to rent. I started at 3am and finished at 930 am and finally had a place confirmed on my own through a different service. AirBNb your thoughtlessness almost ruined our trip. As parents of a special needs child, we have a lot more prep to do than just heading out. I guess you guys just done care.

AirBNB’s foreign service reps were not helpful and quite frankly I just don’t think they understood our problem.

Booking a new place in Paris is much more expensive than what they’re offering. 

Been on a chat with Airbnb for days trying to get them to help us with new accommodations and cover the cost to make the price the same as the place we booked originally.

 Not to mention all the costs associated: finding storage for our luggage while we’re out of the city for a week(was planning to leave our bags at the original Airbnb), throwing away all the food we bought because there was no place to store it at the emergency hotel we had to book, the cost of my partner being covered in itchy bug bites for a big portion of our vacation. And spending so much time trying to connect to Airbnb support and get them to make the cost even. 

Just beware and book elsewhere, if you book with Airbnb and their lax sanitation policies cause your booking to be uninhabitable they will not cover the cost and things will get very expensive for you. Why do I have to pay because Airbnb didn’t check for bedbugs?

We’re not trying to get a free place, just trying to break even for the costs associated with having to flee an infested apartment.

Their customer service team could do nothing to help me rebook. 
When I first contacted Airbnb they seemed helpful sending me links to new places. But then there was an error with their booking system and it would not process the credit from my cancelled trip. 
I spent HOURS with customer service (4+ hours on chat, nearly 3 hours on phone- mostly on hold) and all they could do was tell me someone would email me. 
My Valentine’s day dinner was canceled because I was on the phone with Airbnb from 5pm- 8pm with NO resolution. 
At this very moment, I am supposed to be on my way to a fun experience, but thanks to Airbnb’s lack of response and inability to help their customers, my vacation is wasted and I am beyond frustrated. I recommend using a more professional company, such as a normal hotel or VRBO so you can avoid the headache and heartache I went through.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-15T09:06:02-07:00
10162131564,dhdjwofh jd,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id160806123,23.29,3,Could be better,"Airbnb recently made big efforts to revamp its search engines by including things like “tiny homes” and “tree houses” as searchable items. Good idea but they missed the mark. What I really care about - and I think other users may feel the same? - is what is available to you at your stay. The Vacasa app includes “kayaks”, “bikes” “tennis courts” as searchable filters. Availability of these things - along with a home gym or example a gym within a certain distance, as well as a whole host of equipment for other interests - is an important part of choosing a rental. I can - and I do - inquire about these things directly with the property owner before I choose to rent. But using Airbnb would be much easier if these were filters from the getgo. I am currently using the Vacasa app to search for a fall rental that includes kayaks on-site. Much more streamlined.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-20T09:52:00-07:00

Since May of this year, I have been to three different Airbnb‘s that were not what they were listed as. One of them had not functional Internet, which required me to buy an additional cell phone plan to work my job. I was also shocked by the electric stove there so severely that it spilled the pot and flung food on the wall. I received no compensation from staying at this place. Another Airbnb that I stayed for only a few days and nonfunctioning Internet and Airbnb partially compensated me, which was surprising, considering the one with significantly worse problems gave me no compensation, and that was a stay for a month.

A later stay involved finding a place with mildew and broken glass upon arrival.

Another stay involved a place advertised as having ocean view that had no view of the ocean. It was then up to me to find a place in a new city without a car where I don’t speak the native language well. 

Part of what used to make Airbnb convenient is that you could meet with people and see what your place looks like before staying in it. 

Since I have seen three places that were considerably different from advertised in only five months my conclusion is that Airbnb is having issues company and they are not reliable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-29T18:25:27-07:00
