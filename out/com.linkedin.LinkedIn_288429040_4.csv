Hopefully the developers see this and react to it. 

I love LinkedIn. It does a lot of things really well. What it does not do well at all, is the ads and finding new content outside of your immediate connections. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook all do these two points very quietly and very fluidly, so you never really notice. 

I see the same 6-7 ads on LinkedIn forever, without fail, between every two posts, until I report the ads for seeing too often. Even after I report them I will still see them for the next couple of days. I would never spend ad money on LinkedIn because the ads are so inaccurate and annoying. My marketing budget this year is $120,000 and it‚Äôs going to TikTok, Facebook, YouTube and other avenues. Zero to LinkedIn. 

The ads themselves are also just ugly. Fake content about useless (to me) softwares. I personally will not buy Salesforce, Vidyard, Spiro, Hubspot, or MapMyCustomers solely due to seeing it way too often and seeing the same exact ads on LinkedIn. 

As far as content goes, I only see content that is created by my immediate connections OR something liked by one of 10 people. I follow 1200 people, but the same 5-6 people seem to always get the top of my feed ‚ÄúJohn Smith commented on this‚Äù I don‚Äôt care what he commented on.
