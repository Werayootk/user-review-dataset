10969400564,DonnaSB,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id40502541,9.1.354,4,Job Search and Posting Improvements,"Ideas for job search-

Allow to search/filter for location within a company. Where ‚Äúremote‚Äù and ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù are options under location. Then, show all of the locations available in the filter and so you can pick multiple locations, including remote and hybrid. Or, make a completely separate filter for location that lists all locations of jobs posted in that company. 

For the job poster- 

make it a clear distinction for them to select when a position is ‚Äúremote anywhere‚Äù vs ‚Äúremote but you need to live within a certain city, state, country‚Äù. As a seeker, I can see ‚Äúremote‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know if there are still location restrictions on that. It might say New York, but I have to read the details to see the remote specifics.
