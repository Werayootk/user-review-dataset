Buuuuuut there is one itty bitty thing I don‚Äôt really like about it.. you can‚Äôt play the song you want without it shuffling multiple songs and not the one you want. Which is very annoying sometimes when your trying to show someone a song you like or something like that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ But other than that little inconvenience it really really TRULY an AMAZING app. Also, the premium is a good option too they have many options and plans to fit you or your family‚Äôs needs ( I can‚Äôt really say that much about it tho because I don‚Äôt have premium because I am poor, but from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs grater than the free version) Anyway I 100% recommend getting Spotify!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T20:18:31-07:00
