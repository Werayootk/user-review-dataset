11108378109,Riley Klette,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1443152915,8.9.19,5,Only music app I will ever use,Me and my brother have had Spotify for almost 5 years and it‚Äôs been amazing. I had an account then me and my brother shared one and that was a little annoying so he got the premium plan that only has two people and it works great. Sometimes it does lag and freak out but the mechanics of Spotify are simple and not confusing. I try to use Apple Music on my friends phones and it‚Äôs confusing and hard to cue songs etc. I would recommend Spotify to anyone looking for a great music app to download and listen to virtually any song (except ready aim fire by imagine dragons for some reason). I also hope anyone reading this has a great blessed day!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-31T21:50:07-07:00
