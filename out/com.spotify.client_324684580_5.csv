Get this app.‚ú®One problem.,"So, I absolutely love this app. It has so many choices and small artists. But one thing. When someone creates an account that is under 13 or 18 (I‚Äôm not sure) you should filter out explicit covers if albums. Yes, I know you have a explicit symbol bar but I‚Äôm not saying to completely not allow them to view it, just put a warning that this song or cover of the album is very explicit, you know? Also, I understand how important free speech is as well. I don‚Äôt agree with censoring music btw but I just thought that tool would be helpful to minors. It‚Äôs just sometimes the cover of the song will have nudity (specifically Doja Cat, lol) this review is coming from a 14 year old who just doesn‚Äôt like to see explicit covers. I hope this sounds pretty reasonable. T~ Edit: I have seen a lot of full -ish nudity on playlist covers recently. Not asking you to completely take them away but please PLEASE add a censorship to some of them. If people want to view the image, just pick a selection for it. There‚Äôs so much nudity specifically in rap album covers. Please fix this. EDIT: Hey, one more problem. I don‚Äôt own the premium version so when I play a song and an ad comes on it‚Äôs incredibly LOUD. Like, WANT A BREAK FROM THE ADS?‚Ä¶ yeah, I sure do. But not when a man‚Äôs voice that piercing my eardrum. Please automatically turn down volume when an ad break comes around. Then, with an ai it will automatically turn it back up to its original volume once the ad break is done. Thank you.‚ù§Ô∏è Another EDIT: okay. You NEED to add some censorship to your ‚Äúshorts,‚Äù which are a clip of the song Spotify thinks you‚Äôll like. I accidentally stumbled upon one that was RAUNCHY. Please censor this. I get that Spotify has millions of users and you can‚Äôt answer reviews much but seriously, please answer mine. EDIT: ONCE AGAIN I HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF NUDITY ON THIS APP. PLEASE ADD SOME SORT OF LIMIT OR GREY AREA TO BLOCK OUT EXPLICIT CONTENT AND NUDITY. THANK YOU.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T20:30:09-07:00
