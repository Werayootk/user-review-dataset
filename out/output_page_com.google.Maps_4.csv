I still use a built-in system in my present vehicle. But increasingly—and since iPhone 5 and iPhone 6—I have been depending on Google Maps to route me to specific destinations, and using my car’s BlueTooth connection system to provide continuous directions through my car’s sound system. I have found it extremely reliable, and I certainly have appreciated that it is constantly updated and free. As most newer cars can connect with their owners’ smartphones now—and as most smartphones can be charged in the car—I highly recommend this application to everyone who has to do a lot of driving!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-04T15:04:10-07:00

I do, however, have a suggestion about something that needs to be improved upon, at least in my opinion. I will explain the issue by using an example. So let’s say I am at my house, and I want to figure out how long it will take me to get from Walmart(Point A) to Target (Point B). The problem I run into is that the app automatically sets my house as Point A, and it usually doesn’t give you the option to change Point A to something other than your current location. I know it’s possible to do so, because I’ve done it before, but it isn’t easy, and every time I’ve done it it’s been by mistake. Improving this aspect of the app would make it even more user-friendly. Sorry if this is difficult to understand, I probably over-explained it, but yeah that’s my input.

Desperate to avoid sitting on the GW in NYC for 2+ hours (after already driving for 8 with 3+ more to go) I opened Waze. *WAZE* immediately redirected me, getting me to my destination and saving me a needless 2+ additional hours in my vehicle.

Google - PRO TIP: When offering a “navigation” tool, the people using it want the QUICKEST, most EFFICIENT way to their destination. They don’t want their lives disrupted further. I had to make an 8 hour drive today. Google Maps would have made that 11+ *for no reason.* This is not an isolated incident. Me?

I took a small detour in the parking lot I was in to navigate to the route… immediately changed to the route with tolls without prompting. I manually change it back to the route without tolls. A d-bag doesn’t let me get into the turn lane and I have to drive straight instead… again, it automatically changed the route back to the toll route.

This is annoying because it will linger for way too long unless I close out of it (while driving!) and it’s info I didn’t ask for, obviously I don’t care about slowdowns that are on routes I’m not taking. It’s withholding directions and route view while it does this so I need to take my eyes off the road to close the very small X on the pop up. That just seems like an obvious bad idea.

Other than that I really like this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-17T10:46:12-07:00

I’m pretty sure most of the positive reviews are fake, or were at least written when people had 16gb phones and Google Maps was so new that people were just excited for a Maps app and they didn’t care if it sucked. 

Maps routinely doesn’t label exits properly or in accordance with what the exit itself is labeled as so then you miss the exit in question. Additionally Maps often lags and so if you’re in a city you may frequently miss exits because you’ll be entering the highway and supposed to take the exit right after you enter, but Maps lags and doesn’t provide that information until after you’ve passed that exit. If you actually have good cartographic instincts, it may be more prudent to spot out the directions and streets beforehand on the map and not actually use Maps when you’re driving and to direct you on the fly. The amount of times I’ve lost 10-20 minutes because of issues with Maps is ridiculous.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-25T22:48:51-07:00

This makes absolutely no sense - I understand it defaulting to either the fastest OR the most efficient, but why it would ever automatically show the worst route option is beyond me. The only option in settings relating to this is to automatically choose the most efficient route, but this would not solve the issue if you regularly need to get places quickly.

It also regularly glitches where there’s no way to actually start a route as the bottom “bar” won’t show. Tapping anyway just places a pin; the only way to get the bar/section with the “go” buttom is to clear it completely and re-enter the destination.

I mean it’s better than a paper map most of the time, sort of. Honestly though, I use it a lot as a solo driver, and I’m tired of the following annoying and sometimes dangerous things it does:

1. Changes the route after you selected amongst the options. Even the slightest change you make compared to what it has planned (eg getting to a main road from your house a few turns different than the cockamamie thing it suggests) undoes the whole route. It changes it without prompting, and once driving it’s difficult to change.
2. Navigating you through 12 turns when there’s a straightforward way to get to the same place just to save 2 minutes.
3. Sending you on some cockamamie route after you’ve selected the conventional route (sometimes with no prompt) just to save 2 minutes. Please, don’t suggest changes that are less than 5% of the total trip time. Or at least make that an option.
4. Sending you the wrong way on a one-way street. This actually has happened to me several times.

1: Allow us to terminate/cancel a navigation session or route by swiping down and 3D touching on the direction notification. Currently we have to open the app and go terminate it there. It would be much simpler, easier, and Safer if we could simply swipe down or 3D Touch on the notification and stop/cancel the route.

2: Allow us to pause navigation guidance. Sometimes I just want to stop and do something that I had previously not thought of. It would be nice to be able to pause the guidance rather than the app constantly reloading and trying to get me back on the route. Maybe allow that also to happen with a swipe of 3D touch on the notification banner.  

3: Lastly, it would be truly amazing if the notification banner was to become reacher and more interactive. For example, in addition to the quick features proposed above, if the notification banner by being activated could show a mini animated version of the map so that the user can see from that screen their position, rather than having to go inside the app that would be amazing.

That small peeve aside, in the commute tab, you can’t pull the fastest route suggestions down to see the map on more than 25% of your screen until you commit (press start) to one - which is the biggest nuisance for me. So you can swivel and zoom but only see the information you want through 25% of the screen before committing to a selected route. 

Hope they adjust that soon. I kind of get it that your commute isn’t going to change much but what’s the harm in letting me see the bigger map before committing to a route?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-19T14:08:17-07:00
10573448961,Eileen Vega,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id555684264,6.92.0,3,It was my go-to for GPS until recently.,"I wasn’t really a fan of Google Maps because I once thought it was too confusing to navigate, but as I got used to it, I loved it. I have an iPhone and still ended up using Google maps, until these past few weeks. The app itself (when it comes to showing directions, and the mapping) is fine, but it’s the arrival time that has been INCREDIBLY inaccurate. I would go to school and the arrival time would be close to an hour away, when the distance usually took about 20 minutes (30-40 on a bad day). Other GPS apps have been more accurate, and it just bugs me how much later/longer the arrival time has been in this app. That’s really the only issue I’m having with this app right now, but it’s a pretty important issue to address since most people need to know the accurate time of their arrival (for planning ahead and such).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-11T01:33:08-07:00

They have my business miscategorized, and I am receiving bad ratings because people are unhappy they can’t get a service that I never offered.  My business is to find lost pets.  There is no category for finding lost pets, so they have me lumped in with shelters.  When people Google for animal shelters, my business pops up.  My website clearly says we are not a shelter.  Most of the calls and inquiries I get are for people needing shelter services, not lost pet tracking.  This leads to people being frustrated with me, when it is really Google that is leading them astray.  Google has no way of fixing this.  There is no category for what I do.  People are going to keep calling me for services I don’t offer, and they are going to keep being upset with me because of Google.  

Other than that, Google Maps is a good app that I use all the time.  When it fails, there is no recourse, no way to fix it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-05T12:38:36-07:00
