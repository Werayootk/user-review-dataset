poem: I hope that I'm good enough.

I hope that I can still make you smile,
that I still can make you happy,
that the way I act doesn't hurt your feelings.

I hope that you still love me.
Do you see me the same in your eyes?
Do you think that I'm still a good lover,
though my eyes have lost their saturation?

I hope that I'm good enough.
I hope that I'm the best I've ever been.
I hope you still love me.
I hope you still care about me.
I hope that I'm good enough.

image: Your poem portrays a deep sense of insecurity and a longing for reassurance in the face of self-doubt. The speaker grapples with questions about their worth, their impact on someone else's happiness, and the constancy of love in the midst of personal changes.

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI. I'm giving it a solid four stars, and I'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-20T00:13:58-07:00

However, the iPhone app is poorly designed (or maliciously designed) so that choosing not to save chat history makes it incredibly difficult to use. Clicking anything - trying to scroll up to see past messages *within* a conversation, slightly swiping left or right, pretty much touching *anything* other than the keyboard - immediately wipes the history. It is practically impossible to carry on a single extended conversation as a result.

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you‚Äôre working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn‚Äôt find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn‚Äôt seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts).

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it‚Äôs prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down.

I could have wrote an indispensable tool to your web experience, which is true, but it‚Äôs an assistant to your actual life.

One year and we are living in a future that is perhaps more advanced than The Jetsons world. 
Except for the flying transports, the robotic housekeeper and pet dog. 

Its actual magic and we are still in the first year since being rolled out to regular people, like me.

     Sometimes I just can‚Äôt type on my phone because, you know, my fingers won‚Äôt keyboard. I do this thing where I mess up my writing and spelling, and decide to come back and fix it later after all of my thoughts are out. Then I sometimes go back and fix it. But sometimes I also forget, making Chat GPT confused on what I am trying to ask. All the poor robot wants to do is help me out, but it doesn‚Äôt even understand what it‚Äôs saying. 

     This is why we need the ‚ÄúEdit Response‚Äù button, where if I mess up by messing up my mess ups on my keyboard, I can go back and fix all of my 100 mistakes with one button. (Also if I edit the response, and mess up, then I would like to edit it again. That would be great for me too.)
