However there is one thing I have noticed. There seems to be a sync issue sometimes between the app and desktop, while it seems the issue maybe more a desktop problem it is an annoyance on the phone. For some reason after checking a comment/activity in the desktop the information is not synced to my phone. So it shows as a missed message. All in all it‚Äôs nothing major, but can be annoying at first. 

Other than that the app is great call quality is great, the UI is simple and intuitive, and performance is amazing for all it can do.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-12T07:49:28-07:00

When utilizing mobile for calls with video, there should be a function included that can be toggled on and off through settings (for those who don‚Äôt find this useful) where the trigger is the user selecting ‚Äúcamera on‚Äù which would create the action of populating a text box requesting confirmation of turning camera on while using mobile. We have seen so many embarrassing stories of people accidentally sharing their video and it‚Äôs not an appropriate time.
