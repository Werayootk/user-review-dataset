I updated this to 4 stars after getting a response from WhatsApp explaining that they had changed the settings to enable seeing name only. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that the method of doing so is not intuitive and doesn‚Äôt really make sense. It involves enabling preview in WhatsApp and disabling on your iPhone. Other apps just give the option of ‚Äúname only‚Äù , ‚Äúname and message ‚Äú or ‚Äújust alert‚Äù (check Signal).

Recently a new update allowing handsfree voice recording released, and it has really improved my experience.  There is something else, however, that really needs to be changed. 

Often times I will be in the middle of recording an audio note when suddenly I receive a phone call.  When this happens, my entire audio note erases and I lose everything I had just recorded prior to receiving the call.  I have been 5 or 6 minutes into record when this happens, and it makes me really angry that it just all of the sudden erases.  

To fix this issue, can something be done, please, that either pauses the recording so that it can later be resumed, or forces the recording to send immediately upon receiving a call?  It‚Äôs very frustrating to start a new recording repeating myself.

When this happens, WhatsApp will be a 5-star app for me.

And as times and technology have changed and advanced, so have the app‚Äôs features and capabilities. 

Now for the reason I had to take off a star:
Despite WhatsApp‚Äôs developments and advances it is still terribly behind in one area. And that is creating an app for Apple Watch users. Or at least a functional notification and response menu. So that when you receive a voice message from someone, you can actually listen to it without having to go to your phone. Which is the whole point of Apple Watch in the first place. And regarding the response options. It would be nice to be able to send more than one single emoji back, or to reply with a voice message, or at least proof/change your dictated message  if there‚Äôs a mistake in it. 

Basically make an Apple Watch WhatsApp app!! Or improve existing interface for it",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-09T07:45:43-07:00

It's got features ahead of its time, and I'm a huge fan of the end to end encryption! However, I do think some improvements could be made. A search function in chats, improvements to audio and video calls, and lastly the ability to set individual chat wallpapers. 

This app however is great, it's zipping fast. It hasn't crashed on me. Another great thing is using whatsapp on the web, the only downside to that is that your phone just be on and connected to the internet.

There is no WhatsApp for iPads and computers and that is NOT OK!!!!! I believe that WhatsApp should be available on all devices. Also when you delete messages it still stays it just blacks out the message and puts ‚Äúthis message was deleted‚Äù over it, this is not a big problem but it does make the chat a little cluttered.
