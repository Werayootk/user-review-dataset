Please Revolut, at this point I just need my money back! I need someone to speak to because the robots don’t seem to understand, and while it usually takes a few days to weeks to look into these things they rejected my request after a few hours! Please help me, I need it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-06T16:36:25-07:00

It’s September 6th now. It’s been 10 days. I have sent emails and Facebook pms 3 days ago but haven’t gotten a reply. The only place to get help according to the website is through the in-app support chat. Funny enough you can’t access that unless you have access to an account. I am leaving to another country and was looking forward to using the services Revolut offers… but now by the time I ever get an invitation + the extra time to get a debit card sent, I might as well forget it.  Pretty disappointed. Mainly when friends who signed up at the same time got their invitation days after.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-05T23:50:34-07:00
10339055503,Jllister,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id145984443,9.22,3,So where’s the money?,"I regularly send money to a friend in Europe.  I transfer dollars to my Revolut account and exchange them for Euros and then send.  Everything is quite fast but the process of moving the money from my bank to Revolut is very slow.  For example, this month I requested a transfer on the 1st of the month. Today is the 7th and the money has not yet arrived.   Last month there was a similar delay.  

With other services, such as Wise, the entire process of moving the money from my account to my friend’s takes only two to three days.  

I find it hard to believe this is the best Revolut can do.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-05T23:49:42-07:00

I did ALL of the requirements yet myself and the referee had all sorts of issues to get the bonus!! I then referred 3 people and low and behold that was also a nightmare to have to prove once again ALL steps were completed before they would push the bonus through. At that time you could actually chat with someone but let me tell you right now they cut that all the way out. My last and current referral is yep you guessed it having issues with saying they have not done all of the requirements. We have tried for FOUR solid days to chat, you cannot not even request it, we’ve sent countless emails and have not heard back from a single soul at Revolut!!!
