‚Ä¢AI has access to memories, the eyes only, and location

What‚Äôs really scary is that my friends nudes were posted to their story. My friend did not post them because those are private. (Yes you shouldn‚Äôt have them in there at all), but it goes to show that nothing is private. AI NEEDS to be deleted for these reasons because once it has been hacked, it can be hacked again, but for much worse matters. Think about it, if a hacker through AI decides to target a specific user, their life could potentially be put on the line.

This app is a trap, It doesn‚Äôt help you talk to your friends, if someone want to talk to you and genuinely cares for you they will text your phone number.

I thought for the longest time I needed this app so I could talk to my friends. I thought it was harmless and just so silly to send a goofy photo to my friends. But once I deleted the app nothing was missing from my life.

2) The new ring light flash option.

Do you understand how it can be destroying for people such as Patrick star, pinkie pie, piglet, toadette, pink panther, Amy rose, bing bong, Miss piggy, Kirby, Courage the cowardly dog, Uniqua from backyardigans, and of course Birdo when they want to download Snapchat and customize they are a bit Moji to look just like them and get to experience what everyone else does but then come to find out that they do not have there own skin tone? How come there is every color ever in your skin options but not pink. This is not inclusive, and I believe people need to speak up about this. I currently deleted Snapchat and many of my many friends told me they delete also. Disappointed in this huge company. My pet flamingo Anastasia,was so excited to get his very first snapchat account and speak to his other mammal friends and when he went to create his bitmoji character
there was no pink for his skin tone. Guess where Anastasia is right now? Dead. We  need to fix this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-27T13:51:12-07:00

My generation has made Snapchat the new dm/iMessage, so for the better part of the last decade my whole life has been in this app. All of my photos, memories, contacts, everything were on my Snapchat account. Then today when I was trying to log into my account, out of nowhere I got logged out because apparently I was ‚Äúcompromising‚Äù my own account. After a couple attempts to reset my password using my phone number AND email, I got a notification saying my account was permanently locked. 7 years worth of memories and contacts erased because Snapchat couldn‚Äôt recognize my own freaking phone. The worst part is my account still exists, I‚Äôm just incapable of accessing it because there is not a real human person that works for Snapchat to talk to about it. If someone could please fix this I would be happy to take down this review. Thank you",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-02T10:25:49-07:00
