No notifications, no indication that I received new emails, nothing. And sometimes this can be a dozen or more emails at a time and from a half hour ago or more. Very frustrating. Then there‚Äôs the issue of the default email font, which is basically the most unpleasant looking and unprofessional font that could have been chosen, that cannot be changed. Next we have the calendar, which is the least intuitive layout I can imagine. I can never tell when I have things scheduled for any particular day, because it‚Äôs just a garbled mess. The layout in Apple‚Äôs Calendar app is much, much, much better. And adding items to the calendar is equally frustrating. Adding attachments to emails is always a fun little adventure, as you never know where or how it‚Äôs going to add them to the email. The whole point of being able to access email on your phone is that it‚Äôs supposed to be quick and convenient, and this app if far from either of those things.

Why is this? Why does Outlook have to refresh all of your mail locally almost every time you open it? There will even be a numerical badge indicating unread messages, but when you open Outlook, you will be notified that Outlook has ""found"" accounts on your system (accounts that you have, of course, already added to Outlook) and you will be prompted to add these accounts again. The standard Apple iOS Mail app actually seems to manage Microsoft's own mail accounts better than Microsoft's email app. How can this be? Is Apple doing sometime here to hobble non-Apple email apps (as they do with non-Apple mobile browsers) or has Microsoft not been able to figure out how to develop native iOS applications? I'm inclined to think it's the latter, because other non-Apple email apps do seem to be able to retain email account continuity. It's a shortcoming only for the Outlook email client. I keep trying to use Outlook as a mobile email client for my Microsoft email accounts and I always end up uninstalling it and reverting to the Apple app or some other third-part email app. It's a shame, really.

Some of the items like calendar events and sending notifications is great in parts but lack in editing. First off. Why is there no copy and paste in Outlook. I had a whole email typed up and I needed to input a link. So what would I have to do? Copy and paste it in. Nope. I have to go to safari and click share and then outlook so I can send a link in outlook. Well then when I get in outlook I have to retype my message or just paste in the other one right. Nope. Paste does not work from previous to new message. So I have to manually copy something by hand. Link or original message. Come on Microsoft. Make copy and paste work the. You get a solid 4. Add some polish and sub folder notifications and some editing tools you will have a 5 Star app again. Please fix these little flaws. You have office and should be able to make a solid app. Now let‚Äôs make it happen. Thanks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-11T15:55:46-07:00
3743825597,bbaacc123184,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id214298216,3.8.1,1,I hate outlook,"This is the worst email app I‚Äôve ever used. Unfortunately, I have to use it because my university uses it. First of all, it‚Äôs the ugliest email app. There‚Äôs no contact photos shown next to an email, like in gmail of yahoo mail, so it‚Äôs hard to differentiate between who is sending you an email. All the emails blend together into a born blob of black and white, making me check this email the least. Also, you can‚Äôt search a phrase or sender and then select multiple emails to delete them. That‚Äôs half the reason I even use the search function. Perhaps you can delete emails this way on a laptop, but I mainly check my email on my phone, so it‚Äôs egregiously inconvenient. In addition the focused and other email tabs are so stupid. The app just arbitrarily organizes them with no knowledge of what emails are actually important to you and which ones aren‚Äôt. As a result, I often don‚Äôt see important emails in a timely manner because they go into the other tab. Checking my email shouldn‚Äôt have this many complications, and being able to delete my emails by search should be an option. Please fix your dysfunctional app. I‚Äôm hoping I never have to have another outlook email after I graduate.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-07T09:31:40-07:00
1935351668,WheezyG,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id132940324,2.51.0,2,Not possible to access iCloud files,"My employer uses Microsoft outlook for email. This would not be a problem if not for this apps inability to attach documents I store on my iCloud. All my devices (watch, phone, laptop, iPads) are apple devices. I store all of my important files on iCloud. If I am replying to an email and want to send an attachment, I‚Äôm out of luck. When I click on attach, the Files section does not include iCloud. 

I decided to have my Google Drive sync my most heavily used work-related folder on my iCloud. But when I try to set up that account under Files, it fails and I get a notification to contact support. 

Support seems really communicative however. They are definitely interested in helping me make this work. Unfortunately, when I see a support notification pop up, I cannot even open the conversation without first trying to set up my Google Drive, then having it fail, then seeing the pop up with a link to contact customer support. There is no way to access the customer support chat without forcing something to go wrong then opening up the chat window. This is a definite flaw in the iPad version of this app!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2017-11-20T10:01:49-07:00

Please invest in making contacts better so that the full contact can be seen when you open it rather than multiple clicks and opening and closing sections on each contact. Scrolling through the contact is a better experience. Also, where is the search function on the main page for contacts? I have hundreds of contacts and I need to scroll through them each time to locate one. Have a search function please. Please improve contacts and do not let the desktop version of contacts ever resemble this layout. It is clunky, ugly and inefficient. Microsoft office is the absolute gold standard and in a league of its own.

6662386546,Mhopkinspfe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id299507974,4.63.0,5,Email cascade,"One issue with Outlook is the embedding of emails. If I get an email and others are included, their response is what shows up as the original email. I can‚Äôt scroll down the list of email and find the original sender because it is now listed as being from whoever responded. 
Also, if you forward the original email, and then try to respond to the original email, that option isn‚Äôt available. 
I find this very frustrating and using the search option is not that helpful.
One other thing...when starting an email, the way it starts is confusing...you type in (if new) or select an email...then you have to figure out what to tap to start the email...if you hit the > then it wants to send and you haven‚Äôt even written anything! But, you are saved because there is nothing in the subject box so you can select ‚Äúcontinue editing‚Äù and get to the actual email.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-19T04:05:13-07:00

I like the look and feel of the app and it is easy to use. But the bare minimum functionality of an email app is flawed - getting new emails and syncing.

The app shows 34 unread messages in the badge icon. But when you open the app, it only shows old messages. I tried restarting the app, restarting the phone, and reseting the email account (which is another pain point as it requires app to be restarted for each account reset - I had 6 accounts added). Nothing gets new emails to show. Even the emails that were deleted in last 2 days were still in the inbox when checked by logging in directly to the server via browser.

Really wanted it to work as it works well with Exchange accounts and doesn‚Äôt prompt for re-authentication every 30 days (endorced by organization), but the above mentioned problem makes it pretty useless for me. Returning to the native mail app for now with no intention to give this app another try.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-22T19:14:35-07:00

(My company is working on improving them, but I don‚Äôt like getting notifications from Office each time a message is flagged as possible spam. Once a week, every other week, or once a month is less work for me and effective because they are almost always correctly identified as spam, although many spam messages are still missed.)

I also wish there were more ways to flag/categorize messages by the speed with which I need to respond. I use flagged emails as my to-do list (and even email my self to-do items) and would like to see higher priority/urgent messages at the top but still see all flagged messages at once.

I have colleagues with similar working styles at other companies, so it‚Äôd be a great feature to add (or notify us on how to do it, if already available).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-29T07:47:19-07:00
