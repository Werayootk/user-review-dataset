I commend Uber for providing excellent service. & I can see Uber is improving all the time because I see new changes each time. I like the stop feature. that's clever, excellent. I'm
not complaining. I'm
simply giving some suggestions..... other than that, that's excellent service...... I wish there was Uber for everything. because there are people who are independent but still sort of disabled, who don't have any help from family or anyone because everybody is busy working. sometimes they need someone to do errands for them for groceries. if an Uber worker could do some groceries or miscellaneous tasks too. that would be awesome......some people don't have a car to work or lost their car temporarily. it would be nice if there was a special rate for individuals who need to get to work who can't afford a rental for two, three, four months......just like when Uber created uber eats which is very good! ü§ó",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-24T12:57:50-07:00

Morris backed up and came forward and Walla  the thing came loose. We went to see what it was and it was one of the markers that they leave on the side of the road. I think someone before us knocked it down. It was was right when we entered the tunnel where the bright lights are and we just did not see it until it was  too late.  We did not know what we were going to do if the car broke down? That would not have been good. We talked about miracles and God. For sure we know God was looking out for  us. Morris brought us to the hotel and we said goodbye. It‚Äôs funny how you are just going along and a bump in the road comes along.

Some of that fraud included Uber charges.  When Discover removed the fraudulent items, they also mistakenly removed a legitimate charge from earlier that month that was not in dispute.

As a result, I now have an unpaid balance on my account.  In reality, the charge that Discover erroneously removed had already posted and it showed up on my February Statement.  After some back and forth with Uber and with Discover Card, it seemed like we were on a good path forward to resolve the issue.  Discover Card informed me that they would reinstate the charge in question.  The problem is, fixing this is not immediate.  Meanwhile, I have used Uber for several new trips and it now appears that Uber is holding tips ransom from those drivers until that unpaid balance is resolved with my credit card company.  These drivers had nothing to do with the billing issue but Uber is interfering with their livelihood by not allowing my designated tips to go through.  I am even using a completely different credit card which is my Corporate Card used for business.

In general it‚Äôs been a good experience.  However, I see all sorts of issues with the way the app works.  I‚Äôd love to be able to provide this feedback to them in the app and help them improve and avoid several situations where they‚Äôve been unintentionally making it more difficult to use.   There is no way to contact Uber to let them know these things.  As a result there have been issues that have existed for years and create annoyance on a weekly basis.  This is not the type of customer centric experience I‚Äôd expect.   One of many examples.  When booking a ride to the Atlanta airport, the app only displays the first characters.  These are Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson... then it gets cut off before being able to select the only information that really matters - which terminal?  As a result, ever ride defaults to the international terminal.  Every passenger and every driver I‚Äôve talked with about this has experienced the same problem.  I‚Äôm sure this happens thousands of times a day.   Probably worth the minute it would take to fix this.  This App Store feedback is the only way I‚Äôve found to actually communicate this to Uber.

So for example If you are someone who takes a long trip with Uber you might notice the driver snarling at you or getting angry this is because they didn‚Äôt know that they were going to have to go that far and now they take it out on you. But think about it this is neither the driver or the passengers fault that would point directly to Uber. Second is Since I‚Äôve used Uber over 100 times I‚Äôve noticed that every driver uses Google maps or Apple Maps not the app navigation. I am not a Driver so I cannotReview the navigation on it but I do know however that the location is very off for pick ups and to mention the pinpoint location feature is pointless this could be improved  dramatically. Why are the lyft drivers never confused as where to pick me up.
Seriously tho I love Uber you guys have come thru many nights for me and made it possible to do life with a suspended license I would‚Äôve gave five stars if it wasn‚Äôt for these two things.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-09T13:25:08-07:00

UberPool makes you walk even if you don‚Äôt want to. Sometimes it gives you the option to pay almost $2 more to get a door-to-door service which makes it about the same price of getting an UberX so it loses the purpose of booking a Pool. I remember when you just initiated the new UberPool system, you told customers that it will decrease prices. What we actually got is the same prices for having to walk to get an UberPool which doesn‚Äôt bring you on time to where you need to get. Driver arrival times are misleading, destination arrival times are misleading, and us customers just keep cooperating with inflating prices while the service we actually get is worse. It would be more fair if at least we customers could now upfront that we get worse service and have the option of reaching a better decision whether we should call an UberX or a Pool. If the ETA of the driver is said to be 9 min, it cannot arrive in 20min (assuming he didn‚Äôt have any unexpected obstacles in his route) and if the ETA to your destination on a Pool is a window of 20min but it actually takes 40min to get to your destination, you should notify the rider upfront on the actual time window of arrival so he can reach a smart decision whether he wants to use the service or not.

I am over the age of 18, but not 25 yet and Uber does not have a way to tell which company will allow you to rent at 18 extra fees. So the only way to be able to see is by booking and then you will be able to see. But with the rental policy you will not get your money back. Although I did not use any of the services, I lost over $125 with Uber, I was able to get the bank to dispute part of it, which they could not dispute all but part which I completely understood. When I go to open my Uber app, they block for requesting rides. The amount that my bank was able to dispute was put back into my account and unless I paid I am not able to request a ride or use uber eats. Now with Lift you are able to see the age gap ahead of time and you do not need to go through so much trouble just to rent a vehicle. Not only that, it is very difficult to access their customer service. The only thing they offer is a chat that does not respond right away, which makes things very difficult.

I have used Uber for the past 5 years but constantly get the impression that it does not prioritize or place the interests of its rider at the same level with its drivers. The main issue for me is how drivers do not get penalized for the same things riders get penalized for. You book a ride and get an ETA but more often than not it takes double or even triple the time for the driver to arrive. I keep the driver waiting, I am charged a waiting fee. The driver keeps me waiting and makes me miss a cut off time, what does Uber do to the driver???? Nothing! The drivers don‚Äôt even apologize when they keep you waiting for a looonnngggg time for them. Uber just says your driver may be delayed and maybe you should contact them. What exactly is that supposed to mean? Then if you try cancelling the ride you will be charged for cancelling the ride because it has exceeded the imaginary time within which you can cancel a ride. Then Uber recently introduced this 0 min away thing which is an absolute scam. This isn‚Äôt my only grouse with Uber but one of many. For me, the imbalance of driver and rider interests doesn‚Äôt make me feel this is a mutually beneficial relationship as I feel exploited by Uber ALL THE TIME.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-14T06:21:36-07:00

However, I still think you need to improve the service. First, the location feature for the rider is subpar to me. I use Uber a lot to drive my to college and I have to put in a specific address just to have my drive take me to the part of the school I need the drive drop me off. It would be a lot easier to have a satellite view of the map give the drive an exact location of my destination. Second ,you are now starting to charge all these ludicrous fees such as the waiting fee if my driver has to wait more than two minutes at my pickup location. I understand that having to make the driver wait on me when I sometimes have to get ready when I should have done that before the driver arrived at my location is rude, but Lyft doesn't charge me a waiting fee. Third, I do not like the rating system. The idea that giving anything less than five starts automatically assumes that the driver did something wrong. If I give a driver a four star rating you assume that the driver must have done something. When I give a driver a four star rating I am telling the driver that I enjoyed the drive. I do not imply that I had a horrible experience with an Uber rider.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2017-10-17T04:37:23-07:00

Five stars for this ride to the public transportation center of the city. 
When we arrived back at the Brisbane Transit Center three day later and needing a ride to the residence, we again contacted Uber. We described where were, under a very large sign stating Brisbane Transportation Center including it‚Äôs street address. We got a text from our driver to verify location, and we agin texted our location, address, and location under the very large sign at the entrance to the transit center. Three days earlier we had been dropped off about 30 meters from where we stood on the same side of the same street by the first Uber driver. The potential driver responded with a thumbs up. The app indicated he was less than a minute away. He called a moment later and my wife again explained to the driver our location. My wife said he was difficult to understand.

Drivers don‚Äôt like  to drive many minutes to pick up rider, because they‚Äôre not compensated for the time. I end up being punished with extremely long wait periods.

When I‚Äôm being picked up my house, I always send the driver a note letting them know. I have no driveway and I need them to turn around at the dead end and pull up in front of my gate. This is because, Uber tells the driver they‚Äôve arrived at their destination when they reach a house three houses away from me. And they have no idea what the number of my house is. My neighbors don‚Äôt like their driveways used as turnarounds. I do this as a courtesy. And yet, I have had drivers pull up in front of a house on the opposite side of the street ,up the street from me. Either they‚Äôre not reading the text I sent them or they don‚Äôt like being told what to do. 03 times drivers have literally looked me in the eye and put their foot to the gas zoomed up to the dead end turned around and canceled my ride.

I am a user and a driver. When it works it works pretty well on both ends. When it doesn't, it fails in spectacular ways; stranding you at airports because you trusted it to work and made no back up plan for your 11:00pm arrival and subsequent 1 hour of troubleshooting the app. To make it worse, support is U. S. E. L. E. S. S. For some reason every response is from a different person who has zero access to previous communication. Last night I picked up a rider, the app crashed on pick up. The rider had to verbally direct me. Then I spent five minutes fixing the app. Now support is 7 emails deep even though I literally told them everything, sent screen shots proving the ride (a habit I am now in because of the app). It should have been a $4 ride for the user and $3 for me but they charged the user $0, then $13, and now $5 in 24 hours because they can't read the details I've sent now three times (pick up, drop off, time, miles and even did all the math for them).
