You run miles on a subway track and you get coins and with those coins, you can buy new characters, awesome hoverboards, and different outfits. The game can sometimes hold new events and rank you on a leaderboard! (They show the results at the end of each month.) At first, it got me super addictive. Also, for any parents that are reading this, I don’t mean “addicted” in a bad way. I mean that it gets you interested with all the cool features the game can do. It doesn’t include chatting with other people, or any money (unless you want to buy any of the new characters, coins, or keys.) But like I said, I have better things to do, but in my free time, I really recommend Subway Surfers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-31T03:12:31-07:00

If not, here's what to add to your grocery list: · Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour. · Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes. · Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes. · Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty. · Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes. · Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together. How to Make Pancakes From Scratch It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Sift the dry ingredients together. 2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine. 3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan. 4. Cook for two to three minutes, then flip. 5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides. When to Flip Pancakes Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side. How to Reheat Pancakes Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-30T18:25:02-07:00

But however I have a few requests. First of all, the plant invasion is so fun and tough, love that but not this: It takes forever to complete–you’d have to play like 2-3 hours straight to do it and I can only barely complete the 1st of 5 stages in just under an hour so It would be great if you guys could shorten it a bit. Next, instead of having to get the sticker pack separately that would be nice if you would get the stickers with the app. Last of all, make the seasons like 1-3 weeks longer than usual. Otherwise, I can’t think of anything better to add to the app, so AMAZING job on the game and consider some of those things. Sincerely, LongShotHawk Ps: also guys, if you are going to respond to people don’t just copy and paste your responses and that’s just not nice to do so PLEASE actually write your responses devs.

Ps: one little thing that is kinda annoying is the Farley long loading screen, like with another game I have, it literally takes like 5 secs and your guys’s loading screen is like 15 or more so if you could maybe make it a shorter load in, that would be great.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-30T15:53:10-07:00
