It’s very fun and the characters are very unique,I especially love the characters whose colors pop out the most! I have been playing this game since I was little, like many people who play this app, and I absolutely adore it! I would like to make some suggestions for the game, you don’t have to put these in I’m just suggesting because they would make me a bit happier, I think you should add more characters with unisex clothing so that they aren’t entitled to a specific gender or color. Like have a girl in a  hoodie, not talking about miss Maria’s cropped hoodie, but like a normal hoodie and maybe some shorts or ripped jeans, and maybe a boy wearing a cropped shirt, or make the boy wearing something like casual wear that stands out more! I also would love to see a non-binary character added to the game! 
Anyways those are just my suggestions and reviews about the game. You don’t have to add any of my suggestions if you don’t want to I’m just suggesting because I feel like they would be better and have the player(s) express themselves better!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-19T19:21:40-07:00

I’ve played this since I was 3 or 4 . If you want a good game to play when you are bored or just in general then play this . In this game you can gather coins as you go through obstacle courses. You start of committing a crime then the police chase you wich is fun! You can get keys that will revive you when you lose  and cool items that will help you along the way! It’s a really fun game that you should share with your friends and challenge each other. Sometimes you can even get a new high score. Something that really bothers me is that when I play a game and a battery thing pops up it will make me loose , but in this game it doesn’t! When the battery thing pops up , it gives you three seconds after that and and then you can play . When I get home from school I immediately want to play this game ! I do think you should get this for free! No this is not one of those advertisers making a fake review this is a 10 year old girl .

There’s multiple bugs that have screwed over my scores and progress that I have messaged the support team about with screen recording proof and never get anything helpful in response. The game is overloaded with ads these days and heaven forbid you try to use an ad instead of a key to continue a game you’ve just crashed on. Pretty much 1/10 times you do so the entire game freezes up and won’t let you click any other options or let the run end at all. You get to keep event tokens you’ve earned but the score you’ve hit won’t register because it won’t let you finish the run. You lose the progress with no other options than closing out the app. When messaging support about this the write you off as not having game center or facebook linked to ‘save your progress’ but it’s an entirely different issue that I have had show up on not just this account but my alternate one on that I have on an old phone for siblings to use. This bug and so many others have made it so frustrating that I’m about to quit after years of playing every single day.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-25T11:24:35-07:00

I love that they change the map every so often, but the gameplay is getting a little dry as expected. If I could suggest one thing it would be to add some kind of prestige system that would make you start you missions over with the advantage of gaining 1 star onto the max until you prestige again. The new cap could be around 50? 100 even? Anyway this would ad a lot more competitiveness for the game right now! The only other suggestion I would have is some kind of duel mode. Like 2 players put coins together and compete to win the stash by lasting longer than the other in a run. Maybe leagues where the coins are higher as you progress? Or maybe just leagues that get more challenging as you face harder opponents ( this option would need either a leaderboard or some kind of reward system for being in the higher leagues, possibly a coin boost of sorts or just league boxes) anyway I hope you guys look into it since the gameplay hasn’t had any real changes in so long!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-04T05:07:17-07:00

Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day. The update however.... I just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better. The controls are still a bit whacked out. It seems to have a hard time figuring out that you are trying to move left when in midair. Always seems to want to roll or jump instead. I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue. Another one where I have to clear so many hurdles, and then another where I have to run through bushes, don’t seem to work if I currently have a power up. Would be nice to have these fixed!

Keep up the great work. Thanks and cheers!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-11T19:34:16-07:00

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don’t make sense. For example, you’ll jump over a barrier and then you’ll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don’t want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road. All in all, the game is great, it just needs some minor improvements and maybe some more challenges to get the player excited.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-01T02:54:13-07:00

But I truly love this game and im 13 now, This game will always have a special place in my heart and I truly just love this game ❤️ the effort the popularity Everything about this game is amazing. Although, the game should probably make an account option (WITHOUT FACEBOOK) so you can actually make an account without signing in on Facebook because im too young for that and i wanna go  against my friends etc it should have multiplayer just like how it has marathons or something it should be like a little “room”/server where we go against our friends like a race and you can see your friends in the lead or back or something and if u die you either get a option to respawn or wait in lobby/server or something like that.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that’s not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don’t blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report. And for those who have never had the game, I really suggest this to anyone of any gender or age.

I do have a few things in mind to make the game more fun, once you get to a certain amount of coins and a level, you can customize everything your self, what I also think is to have a race with other people online and to have like a little team and do races and tournaments, the other thing is to have different maps and locations you could go to on the game that would be amazing!

9695210245,Nico(las) 👀,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1506792077,3.8.2,4,Very good game! Some glitches though.,"I know everyone is complaining about the ads and stuff, but all games have ads, deal with it. It’s a pretty fun game, and I play it to distract myself or just if I’m bored. But lately I’ve noticed a couple glitches. The first one is one that I don’t really mind, just a boring coin glitch. Sometimes when you’re jumping over two hurdles, you get more coins and stuff, but I’ve noticed that sometimes the coins glitch into the hurdles themselves, so you can’t really get the coins. It should be fine if you don’t fix it though. The next one is an ad glitch. Sometimes when you watch an ad to revive, the ad does nothing and you’re still dead. But then when you try to watch another ad, it kicks you out of the revive screen. The last glitch I’ve found is that sometimes when you’re just running in the subway, you find power-ups, but then all of a sudden they disappear and you don’t get the power-up. 

That’s all I’ve found so far, I’ll let you know if I find anymore glitches or bugs.

I seriously regret my most recent re-download because of a few things that I can boil down to one. Money. Not that there are in-app purchases, or that it's pay to win, I don't care about that. It's that my experience in the game is seriously hindered by the developer's need for money. I am constantly being spammed with pop-ups for in-game purchases and screens telling me to buy packs and offers to watch ads to get stuff. The things is, I don't want any of that. I don't want to spend money, I just want to play the game. I can't even use my keys at the end of a run because the game wants me to watch an ad. I do not want to watch an ad, and I can't stand how the developer is so blatantly obsessed and money hungry. Nobody has to listen to me, I just needed to get my thoughts out there. If any other person wants to spend money on the game, I don't care. I just wish my experience weren't ruined by pressure to buy things.

Maybe make it an option to choose the music that plays in background. Or update the amount of times you change the destination besides Holidays and whatnot. Like every week is a new place. I also wish you didn’t have to get so much of the hoverboards to unlock that person or radio or hat. A couple is fine but it’s annoying to just play constantly and never make any progress to get that character. Maybe add levels or things other than running on containers and trains.

After the update a couple years ago I lost all of my skins and characters, and had to restart my progress on collecting them back up. This was no big deal to me, a little disappointing, but I didn’t spend any money so I figured I didn’t lose much but my own time. After losing all my skins and characters I cut back on how much I played, but it was still an enjoyable game to kill some time and the developers didn’t shove ads down my throat like most other mobile games do nowadays. Recently loaded the game back up after a few months break and after the end of each run it gives me the option to watch an ad to double my rewards, or continue on. Not a big deal, this has been around for a while and I just choose to skip the ad and keep playing. The part that made me rate 1 star is the fact that when you choose to skip watching an ad, the game still loads an ad and forces you to watch, except you don’t get any of the rewards that CHOOSING to watch an ad gives you. 

I am sad to see this game stoop to such levels as it is an OG game for me, and I loved playing it. Sadly I do not play ANY mobile games that force me to watch an ad after each “run”.

The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well.

     If so I would recommend picking up your phone and download Subway Surfers. I love to just sit back and run on the train tracks for hours. What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

There’s about at least 6 new limited players and you cannot buy one with coins it’s either real cash (which it shouldn’t be because this is a KIDS game and kids do not have money nor can get money easily and when they do it’s very little) it’s either real cash or keys, I don’t mind the keys as much but after the first 2 days I had it I accumulated 140k (I was getting between 10 n 20k like 6 times stg😭) but I was not able to buy a limited character despite the fact that there’s at least 6 maybe 8. Only reason why I’d give 4 stars because to kids they want the limited character and no matter how much they work for it and get a big sum of coins , many cannot get it. That’s my only complaint but great game over all very addictive 😂",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-16T08:46:51-07:00

But there is a tiny problem; every time I join the game, it keeps asking me to buy things that I don’t want and this has been going on ever since I got this game which was about 2 months ago and it asks me to buy the same thing over and over again! But thx Subway Surfers for creating this game for all to enjoy! I really hope you guys fix this problem and the others that im gonna list!

Another problem is something that other kids won’t like; every time that you die in Subway Surfers, and you want you revive, you can either use your blue keys or you watch an ad and if you keep watching the ads, it will soon make you use your keys. It may not seem as big of a deal, but, say you are SOO close to beating your high score but you haven’t ever been this close to beating it and you used up all the ads and then you have to revive yourself cuz you hit a sign while the officer was chasing you and you got arrested but you ran out of keys, and again, you used all the ads so you can’t do anything!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-27T15:42:08-07:00

It’s grown over the years, and the world tour was a big, nice hit. I would recommend this to anyone bored, especially during these crazy times. But I have a few suggestions. Can the world tour travel to Malawi, Africa? My dad grew up there, and I would love to see how you design it. Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?
Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,
Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

I love this game because it is updated every month with new characters, season changes, new place, new events, and much more. The world that the developers have created is just magnificent with just one flaw. Watching ads to revive. This feature just annoys me almost as much as I love the game. It deems the entire game pointless. Keys are definitely earned and it is the player’s choice on how to use them, but ads are just impossible to tolerate. My seven-year old cousin is always getting crazy scores. I appreciated it until I realized he was reviving every 20,000 or so. The fact that I get the same scores without get-aways and that they are of the same value as his in the rankings is just so wrong. But as much as this annoys me, It can’t take away from how much enjoyment this game has given me. So a big thank you to all the people who have worked for this, but please consider removing that ability.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-03T01:02:14-07:00

The actual game is neat. I like the power ups you can get in game, ESPECIALLY the mystery hoverboard. I wish it’d appear more often. It’s really cool to be able to test out the different powers. 
If I had to change something, I’d want to make an in game option where if you’re ready to leave the game but don’t want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it’s be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there’d be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it’d have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is. It could be a special event/mission!

7259753987,Asher Mitchell,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1279664434,2.16.1,4,I like this Game,"Subway surfers a really fun game, where you are in the subway and you are trying to dodge trains and try not to run into things. There is a cop and a dog chasing you and if you run into anything they catch you and that’s how you lose. As you keep going the character starts to run faster and it gets harder to dodge things. One thing I would say is that I wish your character started off going a little faster because at the beginning he is going really slow and it is just boring until he speed up. The boosts that it gives you throughout the game like the jet pack, the magnet, the pogo stick, and the boots are cool. Although I did die while I was jumping with the boots because I was underneath something, which was kind of annoying but that’s the only flaw that I encountered while playing. The graphics in the game are good, and there are a bunch of different characters you can get if you play the game enough. I could just keep playing this game over and over again because I enjoy it so much, so I would recommend everyone to play it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-24T12:38:58-07:00

Let me add...Before the update I had no ads what so ever! But now I get ads after every run! I only keep this game just because my high score is 2.6 million. The game is way choppier than it used to be too! Also before the update kinda a while back Star Jake used to be 30 keys to unlock! I used him all the time! But now you have to get 150 spray cans! The part that’s annoying me the most is after the update...I had to unlock Star Jake AGAIN! All I have to say to the people that had the classic Subway Surfers... Do YOU like this update? It really wasn’t worth updating the game...I was kinda happy about the loading screen though! I will say that! One more thing... I noticed the multiplier challenges...I’m at 23x... but  I was doing challenges...when I noticed...”23/30 is the 30x the max multiplier? That’s also a bad idea if it is! I had a multiplier of 32x before the update.

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn’t work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn’t have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone. The graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well. Also, whose idea was it to change cap of the multiplier from 30 to 29.

MUCH. The next day, I hopped on Subway Surfers again, and this continued for hours, the pure joy of unlocking characters and collecting coins was too much. Weeks later, I had figured out different strategies, etc. on how to get a score over a million, the best power ups, and how to use the hoverboard. Currently, I have 65 keys (none bought whatsoever), 200 hoverboards, and I complete my daily logins with perfection. My brother is now concerned about my health, as most of my time is dedicated to Subway Surfers, this game has completely altered my life and I have spent atleast a year playing this now, downloading this app was absolutely revolutionary to my daily routine, when I first hit my 10million score, I was overjoyed, hyper, and amazed on how far I’d come.

On a completely unrelated note I think you should change wordy weekend a bit along with the achievement involving it I think you should only have to do the challenges for characters you have and it well help the achievement too because it will one: influence people to get more skins for the achievement that wants you to own for example 8 characters then you should only have 8 wordy weekend challenge if you have every character then you get a challenge for each one and then you can do then the more characters you get the more challenges you can do and the more high level you can achieve for the achievement that says complete 6 wordy weekend challenge in 1 weekend for example.

Seconds and make a squad multiplayer mode to where the player can invite friends or anyone to join up to 4 or 5 and the squads can compete in Subway tournaments.

Making this update could benefit you because you could make a lot of money and earn a bunch of downloads most likely overthrowing big apps like Minecraft Fortnite clash of clans etc.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-03-23T19:44:13-07:00
5980325338,JurassicPou,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id576768981,2.1.0,2,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!????,I have been playing this game since the release. And NEVER have I been this disappointed and honestly infuriated. It’s so laggy that I can’t speed up at all before dying due to lag. I am running the newest version of IOS 13. So the lag is probably the main issue here FIX THIS PLEASE. This game means a lot to me I’ve played it with my mom for a very long time don’t screw it up now. Moving on to the next issue. The character select. Sometimes I get in and it’s fine. A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don’t show up. Moving on to the next issue. This may be on purpose and if it is it ain’t hittin right! There is distortion with the little heavenly voices sound when opening something or getting a prize. It gets extremely deep and stuff and doesn’t sound right. Moving on the the next and last issue. We can’t get these cakes in five days especially with all this lag. They are in places that are unable to be reached. That have no connection to the player and can’t even be gotten with power ups. I want this Salma girl SO MUCH. Please fix it please please please!!!!!!!😡🥺🥺,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-22T11:50:53-07:00

I use to have so many characters but this is the third time the game has reset itself and only kept my score and deleted all my money my keys and my characters that I’ve earned. If this continues to happen I will no longer play this game. I’m so infuriated right now! I had over 180 keys and over 20,000 coins and it’s all gone back to the original 18 or so keys and 5000 or so coins they give you at the start of your progress. Also I beat all the missions so that I’d have 30x multiplayer and it’s back down as well. Again this is the third time this has happened to me and I’m getting tired of playing to earn all this stuff just for the game to glitch and take it all away. Not once have I taken the game off my phone either. I’ll just go in like normal and everything has been reset except for my score once I sign into Facebook. I honestly don’t even think I’ll keep the game anymore. I’ve contacted support through email and all they did was ask questions and never helped or returned anything I’ve earned and now it’s happened again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-06-02T12:41:30-07:00
7681156210,Johanna Schaurer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1170778987,2.21.0,5,Found a bug (please don’t snipe me),"Hi, I am a player of Subway Surfers, I have been over the years since the game first arrived. I am what you would call a cheater, or a jailbreaker, but I am what I call an ethical jailbreaker. I do use tools to break games, but I try as much as possible not to ruin other people’s fun and try to just be in my own corner, and if I find any bugs due to my special abilities, I report them.

That is why I’m writing this. As of the current Mumbai update, I found a nasty bug that could be exploited to increase high scores if done correctly and you have plenty of time to waste. I wanted to report this to you so you could fix it.

The bug is that if you hit the Booster (the red fire booster you get when you revive or start a game) and activate a Spraycan Pogostick at the same time, the game will freeze the boost, noclip the character and land them on the ground instead of running the boost. This means the character will essentially run forever, the score continuing to tick up at the current rate, without being impacted by any obstacles or collecting any objects, until the user decided to Quit the run. I tried using Hoverboards and such to exit the glitch, but all it did was make the weird jetpack-running character turn into a hoverboard-riding version while still wearing the boost jetpack. 

I hope this is useful to you to fix the bug, and that I don’t seem like a total bad guy because of what I do. I do try to help when I can.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-11T08:51:55-07:00
10163471584,Zhenming Du,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id270828801,3.15.0,1,There are two glitches,"So the first one is serious since it interferes with my gameplay, so it says there’s no internet but I do have internet! It’s bugging me tho since so many of the event require you to travel to some other place and it doesn’t work, meaning I can’t get special characters. The second isn’t as major but is still bugging me even if it doesn’t really make a difference when playing the game. So there’s a part in the subway where you go through an arch on the left, and then a train passes through. There are two trains tho, train A and train B. A is moving, so you have to swipe to the right quickly to dodge it. However, when you look through the arch, train B (which is on the same lane as train A, but is stationary instead of moving) appears before train A rushes through quickly. I think it happened because they didn’t take account into how trains can’t switch lanes (there is no indication of that in the game) especially when the trains are so close, and they ended up making train A just go through train B. I like the game but the details just make it a lot better, and there are probably a lot more glitches, but I think you should be more careful about them",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-20T18:45:35-07:00

It’s so addicting to play, like I will wake up in the morning sit in bed and play subway surfers! But what is really getting on my nerves is when I tap to start running and ad pops up and it really frustrating!!! I know lots of other people have had this problem so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE WITH A CHERRY ON TOP, fix it! Also everything is so expensive! Like to get 1.2 million coins is $100 HUNDRED DOLLARS!!! WHOS gonna pay for that? Not me! Also who is gonna buy double coins $5 bucks when you can just pick up a magnet and get TRIPLE COINS! (For free!!) this really makes me confused. Other than that if you don’t already have subway surfers you should definitely get it! It’s super fun to play and the characters are so creative! I recommend this game 97% (not 100% because there is three problems). So subway surfers if you read this please definitely make some changes to the game because I know EVERYONE has these problems 🙂!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-07T10:02:13-07:00
6051641813,maryland21,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id627250075,2.1.3,4,Change in graphics,"Trust me: I love this game. Played it for hours and just recently bought the 950k character, but the graphics recently changed and look more like graphics found in a game made 5 or 6 years ago. I wish the creators would go back to the graphics that were in use even a month ago but I understand if the developers no longer have enough downloads or are generating enough revenue for the better graphics, but I also wanted to make it common knowledge that the game has changed, in my opinion, for the worse. Again love the game, not a fan of the new (or old?) graphics. In order to make it better it would be great if the graphics on the jet pack had less exhaust—the moving from side to side with a long trail of exhaust moving as the character does makes it look old, cheesy, and cheap. The way the character moves under tunnels also looks odd—it would be better to keep the POV of the gamer in one position as the character moves under the tunnel instead of bringing the overall view under the tunnel as well.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-08T10:41:17-07:00

I was playing super runner to get the skin super runner fresh. I was only on stage 3 of super runner. But, an offer for the super runner fresh set came in the shop. I was planing to buy it, so I waited tomorrow. When it was the next day, I checked to see if the super runner fresh set was still there. And to my surprise, the offer was not there. There was only 7-9 days left to get super runner fresh and the bombastic board. And I was shocked that I HAD TO start over at stage 1 to get super runner fresh and the bombastic board. I wasted head starts on the super runner fresh. My progress was gone for super runner and I decide to give up because it’s just a skin and we don’t get what we usually want. I couldn’t get super runner fresh because there is only a week or 1-6 days left to get super runner fresh. But thanks for making this game. You don’t have to fix this problem. Have a good rest of your day. Bye!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-10T10:26:01-07:00
