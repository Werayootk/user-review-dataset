Toggling back and forth is cumbersome and time consuming. The new interface is a little difficult to get used to in terms of finding things. I only stumbled on how to get to the place where I can edit my listing settings and even now I‚Äôm not sure how I got there. Editing the listing should be all in one place and not having to go to your calendar to edit certain parameters. overall, the app is OK.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-14T07:29:55-07:00

Mostly, our experience has been positive‚Ä¶and much better than VRBO which was a terrible app. But there is something they need to fix before it comes up again for me.

First of all, however, I‚Äôm not a fan of the options available when setting up our cancellation policy for our guests. For a full refund, you can set it up for 24 hours out, 5 days, or 30 days. No differentiation between 1-night stays, which aren‚Äôt a big deal and week+ stays which are.

But my current frustration is that I recently had a one-night guest cancel 4 days in advance due to a family emergency. I told them if they cancel, I could refund their money. I‚Äôd done this for other guests in the past. But after they canceled, I found out this feature had been changed, and I could no longer do what I‚Äôd promised. I had to go through the support team, explaining the situation, having the representative misunderstand, explaining it again, and having them do what I should‚Äôve been able to do myself. And oh the joys of a representative telling you how to navigate the app when you already know how to use it well and know what they‚Äôre telling you won‚Äôt work.

Fix this please. If a guest cancels, and I wish to refund their money, I want the ability to take care of it myself.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-12T15:27:28-07:00
