Some places like mine are pet friendly & offer free breakfast. Most are like being in a home away from home. You can book a treehouse, a yurt, a boat, a cabin, a mansion, an RV, a private campsite, or someone’s couch.  As a host, I enjoy reading my guestbook all the wonderful things that guests experienced during their stay. Walking to the two nearby waterfalls in Dunsmuir, CA or driving to the other 5 waterfalls are among the top adventures my guests write about.  Their stays have allowed me to be home with my grandfather to provide him 24 hour care. I’m glad to have had the time with him and proud to have kept him out of a nursing home.

If you don’t post your bathroom or a clear shot of the tub/ shower, I will never book a room with you. I’ll sleep in my car first.

One time we got scammed by a renter calling a remodeled upstairs a “whole apartment” they didn’t have a kitchen! No sink or anything just a microwave and table in the living room area. Lmaooooo! We had to stay there for 3 weeks and Airbnb offered us NOTHING. There is no way to communicate with people before you book to even see what some of the spaces look like that aren’t shown.

I was double charged once by the app which could have been a serious problem but lickily I had the extra money in my acct. they estimated the return would take a few days but it actually went back in a few hours. One thing I wish the company would adjust would be when youre searching for a place to stay, there is a price listed in the main search but when you click on the place, the prices sometimes change. I also wish that the host had limits at how much they could raise their prime rate over their base rate.

But over the years, I have observed that this app mostly favors hosts and doesn’t really give affordable accommodations to guests anymore. We have had several issues with the property description and the actual property, but Airbnb would never hold the host responsible. This is the main reason why hosts are taking advantage and don’t even bother cleaning up the place anymore. When you ask for refund for things that were missing, you get bullied and harassed by the hosts (and a negative review on your profile) while all along they will sweet talk you into giving them a 5 star rating so that their local business is not affected. The app itself won’t work on LTE most of the times. With the tremendous cleaning fees that the host charge and the service fees of Airbnb, the quality of accommodations and service by Airbnb is laughable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-10T13:38:50-07:00

For example recently I had to cancel my stay because the place wasn’t what I was expecting. For cancellation fee I was charged $1000 which I could only see after hitting the confirm to cancel button.  This shouldn’t be the case right because it’s like having to purchase an item without knowing the price. Also everything was on the host discretion. The only thing airbnb support could help is rehashing what the guests has said to the host. In my case the place I booked  was so run down that I couldn’t live there anymore. To help guests like me in the future airbnb should have a better policy and take actionable steps to refund their guests instead of just telling the guests to ask the host to refund which I see as very unreasonable because most hosts will be unwilling to do that regardless of the guests experience.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-17T21:32:19-07:00

Spoiler alert: Jay never refunded us, contacted Airbnb and sent them pictures of his nasty place and they gave us 145 dollars.....not 758 dollars that we spent on this stupid place. First and last time I will ever use Airbnb. Everyone I talk to and show pictures too say they will never stay at an Airbnb either now. Customer service is a huge part of a business and Airbnb clearly don’t care about the quality of the rooms they allow on their app. Don’t trust the deceitful pictures because my pictures are polar opposite of the listings.
