I talk to so many people who don’t understand the reason for this or the concept other than drawing away interest in Instagram, which is a marquee name among photographers. \n\nPlease give those who now have to work days instead of hours on Instagram a loosening of these restrictions.  There should be a separate set of standards for business accounts. \n\nEvery time I see an Instagram update, I know how much harder I have to work to have a photograph seen by half the viewership I had a year or two years ago. \n\nThese views are shared by a large audience of photographers I speak with on your changes.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-22T15:15:48-07:00"},{"id":"10586730372","userName":"dillybeans14","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id151083472","version":"309.0","score":5,"title":"Sewing Club","text":"When I signed up; a little late, I was still so nicely welcomed and encouraged to share my thoughts in a whole new light.
