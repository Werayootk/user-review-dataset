You used to be able to go into an artist album and look at the songs and preview play them, now you can‚Äôt, this is extremely annoying when I‚Äôm trying to preview songs to add to my playlists. It was fine before but they are always changing it. Another issue I have are ads. There used to be 2-3 ads about every 30 minutes with the occasional ‚Äúwatch the video to get 30 minutes ad free‚Äù ad. Now, ads every 2-3 songs and when the watch video ad comes up, I still end up watching two more ads after the ‚Äúso called‚Äù only video. The list goes on and on with things. This app was much better months ago but it is getting very out of hand.

Instead of showing artists you have music saved from, it shows artists you follow (i don't follow any because it seems redundant to both save an artist‚Äôs music AND follow them around). Below your followed artists, it has recommended artists based on what you listen to but even if you select those, it will play songs by the artist that you haven't saved.

I dont really listen to music by playlists, i prefer to listen by artist (not every song by the artist, just the songs by the artist i like) so this app is pretty useless at this point.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-06-27T11:23:19-07:00"},{"id":"7520450827","userName":"jacob demario payne","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1218319885","version":"8.6.30","score":5,"title":"Hello","text":"The grind is really hard for me because anymore that‚Äôs right now frfr the mob is on everything the platforms are cracking me up and it‚Äôs not hard for me to to make a hit because I have plenty hits I promise myself that it‚Äôs not hard for me anymore because I‚Äôm godstrapped myself because that‚Äôs why my heart hurts because I‚Äôm right now goddrillion and they want to see me right I am now right because now I‚Äôm been working hard for president and internet connection is not working anymore my phone off they have my own money right church stole money right that‚Äôs crazy because it‚Äôs not they‚Äôre money right that‚Äôs not godly thats why they heart hurts because it‚Äôs not my heart because it‚Äôs earth god to y‚Äôall me Jacob Demario Payne this two not twins never was I don‚Äôt have anything else to say because I‚Äôm trying to get myself right and y‚Äôall have to say something about it to I set it up myself before it‚Äôs not like that I am watching it myself because I‚Äôm still alone with myself mentally and spiritually frfr wait for god‚Äôs plan for you to come get me!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-29T13:25:00-07:00"},{"id":"10111544310","userName":"Buggabea123","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34987700","version":"8.8.50","score":4,"title":"Plus button instead of like button","text":"We‚Äôve been using the pro version for over 6 years now, and I never had a problem with the updates. But the new plus instead of the like button is a nightmare and has ruined the accessibility and has made the liked songs process feel like a chore. The main issues are removing songs from the liked songs playlist, inconsistencies with if it opens the ‚Äúadd to playlist‚Äù page or just adds it to liked songs, wanting to add a song to a playlist without adding to the liked songs, and reorganizing the songs. With the old like button you were able to tap a the like button twice on a previous liked song and add it to the top of the liked songs playlist so you wouldn‚Äôt have to scroll. But now it‚Äôs adding many extra steps and it‚Äôs quite annoying. I really don‚Äôt see the advantage to changing the like button to the plus button, I really don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never had an issue with this app before or any of the updates and I still adore it I‚Äôm just disappointed and hope your team changes it back.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-06T15:08:35-07:00"},{"id":"9378614570","userName":"SlyWitin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117913404","version":"8.7.90","score":4,"title":"I would love to give this app 5 stars But‚Ä¶","text":"I love the app. I‚Äôve spent about 5,000 hours on it this past year. There‚Äôs just ONE feature I hate. When you make a playlist it has a habit of adding it‚Äôs own songs after you‚Äôve run through them all. For instance I recently created a Christmas playlist because there are only a few Christmas songs I actually enjoy and if I wanted to listen to any Christmas music I‚Äôd turn on the radio. So I created the playlist with a handful of songs it is about an hour long playlist to get through them all but when it has finished the list instead of starting over or just stopping instead it starts playing OTHER Christmas songs that‚Äôs NOT on the playlist. I don‚Äôt care if you THINK I‚Äôll enjoy it because I was just listening to the same genre of it isn‚Äôt on my playlist DONT PLAY IT!!!! It‚Äôs that simple. Other than that problem it is great just don‚Äôt expect to only hear songs on your playlist you create because I don‚Äôt have that problem when I‚Äôm listening to a playlist someone else or even the app made just the ones I created.!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-09T13:03:25-07:00"},{"id":"3230408951","userName":"Raveiin (SM)","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id910770646","version":"8.4.72","score":5,"title":"Amazing App!","text":"All I can say is this app is positively amazing. It is made very nicely, and although it does have an occasional advertisement, that does not possibly amount to the overall amazing quality. Definitely worth getting the premium membership feature (I don‚Äôt own it, but have used it before with a close friend of mine.) This app is a must-have if you have a busy lifestyle and love listening to music!\n  One of my favorite features is the playlist option. You can make customized playlists to your music preference. It‚Äôs positively amazing!\n  You can also add certain artists you like, and it customizes your daily mixes.\n  Another great feature is the daily mixes! The app gives you daily playlists based on your favorite songs and artists, and makes a personal playlist based on the aforementioned favorite songs and artists.\n  Altogether, it is a spectacular app that has MANY amazing features, and I‚Äôm not surprised it is so popular and successful.

The features (when not crashing) are exactly what I want like building a library of favorite podcasts, artists, creating playlists, play speed options, and filtering of lists. That became annoying when filters would get lost between uses.  EVERY time you need to re-select ‚ÄúShow Unplayed‚Äù because ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to scroll through every episode that I already heard just to get to unplayed episodes.‚Äù\nIt also got annoying when the app would no longer advance after successfully playing through 3-4 episodes or songs.  Then the controls went intermittent. Like the advance 15 second function would not work, or the pause button wouldn‚Äôt work so that the only way to stop was to shut down the app.\nToday is CRASH day. Select the 15 second advance button to totally close the app. Restarted the app and selected ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù just to have it crash.

I personally don‚Äôt get this decision, I have loved this app for so long, but the more I go on it, the more I fall in love with music. This naturally evolved to wanting higher quality music and I was disappointed to learn how low Spotify‚Äôs quality really is. I have been a premium memeber for a long time, and I had to switch over to Tidal for my higher quality streaming. I would much rather pay extra for Spotify‚Äôs algorithm, interface, streaming options if they were to add a lossless or cd quality memberships. It was with a heavy heart that I had to cancel my subscription purley based on this. I have bought a great system that could support this quality for a lot of money, I also now pay almost 30$ for Tidal and I would much rather spend my money here than there.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-02-13T03:56:09-07:00"},{"id":"5944534641","userName":"TrueReviewer02","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1130187492","version":"8.5.57","score":3,"title":"Great app, has one big problem","text":"This a a really great music streaming app. I have a free account and use this app all the time.\nMy one peeve is the \"Similar songs\" feature (or problem, depending on where you come from). I listen to a very set group of songs, because there is some music out there that I think is a little crude. Yes, I have the \"no explicit songs\" feature turned on, but I'm pretty strict with what I like. I don't like how when I listen to an album, the app will start to play songs from some totally different band. I look through what songs are in the album, and the one that's playing is not on the list.\nIf I want to find new music I'll go look for it. I don't want to be doing my schoolwork, listening to songs that help me stay focused, and all of a sudden get distracted by wondering what the heck this song is.\nI have the \"Don't play other songs when album is finished\" set to 'on', but this is coming smack within the middle of the album. I haven't listened to all the songs yet. \nIf you guys can fix this \"playing suggested track\" problem, this would be a hands down five-star app. But the suggested tracks are really that much if a problem, so for now its three stars.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-14T07:49:31-07:00"},{"id":"5415045578","userName":"SAT9917","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id594306416","version":"8.5.40","score":3,"title":"Glitchy","text":"Though I do like this app a lot I have issues with it glitching on a regular basis.

Who asked for the hearts to be taken away so we would have a harder time adding songs to the basic liked songs playlist? Literally no one. And y'all are still being dragged for overall having a bad radio variety and playing the same 50 songs. In my opinion, radio should be based on not only the artist played, but also caring more about the genre it's under rather than popularity and playing the same 5 people. People thought paying premium would make listening on the app less insufferable but I guess not. I still like the app but seriously?
