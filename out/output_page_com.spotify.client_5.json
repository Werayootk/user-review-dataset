Well I just want to get straight to the point. So the app is AMAZINGG the only thing that I have against it is that just bcuz we (referring to the don’t have premium)don’t have premium, does NOT mean u keep have to spam ads. Idk if it is just me, but every time I skip a song or it just finishes, it plays an ad. At first it wasn’t like this, it played an ad or two here and there. But I really didn’t think it would get this bad.( plus some of them r kinda \ninappropriate sometimes)Not to mention that we can’t play a certain song that fits the vibe and cannot go back to the previous song. (I am truly sorry if I am complaining rn but I had to say something about it that’s just how I am.) Listen, all I am really trying to say is that you should give more to the non-premium users.

Yes, I love how this app has practically EVERY song and genre, and nor do u have to pay to get just a single song to listen to! Now, I’ve been using this app for a few years now and the new update that they NOT recently released pretty much ruined it. For example: Whenever I search up a song that I would like to just simple listen to from the search bar, it plays a completely different one! Please PLEASE fix this!! It is so irritating. Another thing is that you guys removed the “repeat” button for when you want to listen to a song on repeat. Help! Lastly; before his update, whenever I opened for clicked on a playlist, it would open the playlist and show you all the songs, top to bottom, BUT NOW.. it doesn’t even do that! It just shows empty space and the title and info of the playlist and lists but doesn’t show the songs involved!

Instead of auto playing the individual podcasts that I’ve added to my playlist, the app will either play ALL of the podcasts in numerical order (even ones I did not add to my playlist), or play random podcasts, including ones I’ve already listened to and are labeled “played”.

The main problem with this app is that it randomly stops playing music at 9-11 seconds. At first I thought I let was a connection issue but when I connected to the Wi-Fi at my home it also stops. I tried to restart the app but that didn’t work. The only way I was able to get the songs to start playing again was deleting and downloading the app back.

And even then I can’t pick the song I want or skip to it, I have to listen to the album until it gets to the song I’m looking for. I’m allowed ONLY 6 skips and then I have to wait a whole HOUR to get more. Usually it takes more than 6 skips to get to the song I want. Referring back to the ‘stuck on shuffle’ issue.. when my playlist “ends” it doesn’t actually end. It starts playing random songs. I feel like once the playlist ends it shouldn’t start playing random songs, it should just stop playing songs all together until you start playing another song or restart the playlist.

So having a way of more directly curating ads aside from waiting until you get one that you don’t like, and selecting the reason you don’t like it from a list, pretending that it does something, would be very nice.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-08-25T02:10:36-07:00"},{"id":"7925919738","userName":"AddictedtoAtomas","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id426282641","version":"8.6.68","score":3,"title":"Multiple long standing bugs","text":"I love using this app, but there are many bugs that haven't been addressed in quite some time, with new ones stacking on top of them.

Another is when you have the bar at the bottom and you try to swipe to the left to skip to the next song, it oftentimes glitches and either doesn't skip or sometimes even reverses to a previous song. Another is when you queue a song that you're listening to, it usually picks up from where you were in the song instead of the start. I'm sure there are others as well, and I feel like these are definitely solvable issues, and I don't know why they haven't been addressed yet.

I do like that you can find all the music ever on here. But the last main thing is, apparently, there is no such thing as having a playlist of less than 15 songs that you chose.

It completely changed the playlist layout, they removed the “queue” button along with the “up next” button, you can’t view and remove the songs added with enhance and there is no longer a button to turn off enhance at all. The new way to view the playlist makes it so that you can't skip directly to a specific song and instead makes it so you have to skip through the playlist to find that specific song. When you try to skip directly to a song, it only plays a clip of the song. Also, when you try to search for a song it plays a “recommended” song instead and won't let you listen to the song you actually clicked on. Sorry for the wall of text, but I do hope that the devs change the app back to how it was before the update. Once again, sorry for the wall of text. And the repetitive use of the word “song”.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-05T16:57:08-07:00"},{"id":"5937815806","userName":"barley_gives_reviews","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id964610918","version":"8.5.57","score":4,"title":"My Biggest Problem","text":"I got this app so I can play music without having to wait till someone is done playing music on an app so then I can.  { PROBLEM }.  I have only one problem , it’s that when I finish playing a song it goes to another random one but that’s not the problem. It’s when i play a song then when I go to play other song it keeping playing, then when I pause the song that I want to listen to, it then pauses the song that I didn’t want to listen too. So I have a hard time switching between songs because it would just play the same one and pause it when I’m trying to play another one. Overall I really like the app but that’s problem now, it’s just really bugging me. Tbh I don’t know if anyone has this problem like me but it’s just ruining my experience a little. I’m sorry if there’s an way to fix it, but That problem just annoys me. Anyways I hope this might had helped you.

It’s really frustrating when you can’t change the song you don’t want to listen because you uSeD aLl YoUr SkIpS aNd YoU nEeD tO sLoW dOwN. I especially hate that I can no longer (for some odd reason?? Like???) remove songs from my own playlists. It only says that I can hide the songs but I don’t want them hidden I want them GONE. Like?????? Who’s idea because-????in what w o r l d???? And If I press shuffle I expect the songs to, you know, be shuffled. Not just one or two songs out of order. Also I can’t pick what song I want to listen to anymore I just have to press a playlist and hope a song I like pops up. And if I click on my own playlist I don’t want to shuffle the songs. The songs are arranged by their v i b e s  and if it gets mixed up the playlist just doesn’t work and sometimes I just want to listen to the songs in the order they are in and I don’t want to shuffle them.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-01-20T19:57:07-07:00"},{"id":"5301529877","userName":"promingi_","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1049425458","version":"8.5.34","score":3,"title":"Could Be Better","text":"For starters, this app is really good at fulfilling it’s purpose of the whole music aspect. Like you are able to sort songs into your own playlists and follow your favorite artists. However, this is app is not perfect. The fact that you are able to sort songs in playlists is great, but I find it frustrating how random songs will “recommend” or just play random songs that you have probably never even heard of or put into your playlists. Also, the ads are too much. For example, the “30 minutes of no ads” ad pops up every two or so songs. And if you  choose not to to watch the short video, two or three ads will come up afterwards as to say “You should have watched the video”. If this were more like the desktop version, where you able to pick your songs, get unlimited amount of skips,  rewind or skip into songs, all while have a pretty small amount of ads compared to the mobile version, I think this app would be much more enjoyable to use whenever.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-12-21T12:48:05-07:00"},{"id":"4820706386","userName":"ambulanceradio","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id371600764","version":"8.5.23","score":4,"title":"This app could be so good but...","text":"This app could be so good, but for some unknown reason they want to shoot themselves in the foot.  It seems the playlists want at least 15 songs in them or the fill the rest with crap you don’t want to hear.  Then it only plays the crappy songs and they only allow 6 skips a day. If it just wants to play the crappy ones I might as well just tune in to a radio station I don’t like and save myself the trouble of making all the cool playlists.  I’m not getting to listen to what I want anyway...\n\nNeed to allow 20-30 skips a day & allow smaller playlists.  Also getting to listen to one full length song of your choice, instead of waiting to hear it after going through the entire playlist would really help with ones frustration when using the app.  Fixing 2 or 3 small problems would make this a really cool app, don’t even mind the ads, but the way it is I am being generous in giving this 2 stars out of 5...","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-09-21T17:17:58-07:00"}]
