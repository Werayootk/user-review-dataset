It was a nice app to simply spend time on, especially when my Discover page was similar to the posts I interacted with in my feed. However, the Reels and Shop features have been amplified, while the content within my own feed and the Discovery page seem to stray away from my interests. Many accounts that I follow have to take extra steps in order to show up in their followers' feed. This has made harder for small businesses, non-profits, and activists to spread important information about their cause or product. Simultaneously, their followers have to engage with their posts in a more intense manner. There isn't much reason to save and share a post on your story when you already liked and commented on said post. I understand it may be a way to accurately mold one's feed into the posts they seem to engage with more, but it seems is counterproductive when features such as Reels and Shop are constantly promoted and clutter one's Discovery page. I quite dislike how those elements are placed in the feature bar, while the posting option is located on the very top.

Gives the app a very lonely and more artificial feel, and the following activity, to me, was a superior way of finding new and exciting posts than the discover feature. The following tab in conjunction with the discover was the way to go, leaving the following activity behind in favor of discover disempowers the users‚Äô ability to find new and interesting accounts that lack the influential level of larger accounts which appear in the discover, which also makes it harder for those accounts to grow. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt feel as though removing this feature was a productive change, and it definitely made the app less interesting. Twitter has a similar function to the following activity, as occasionally posts people you follow like pop up on your timeline, and if you have tweetdeck you essentially have an even better following activity tab which makes the app more intriguing.

According to instagram it‚Äôs totally fine if someone steals your photo and uses it as their profile image, & more.

I‚Äòm not sure if this is supposed to help broaden the scope of which posts I get exposed to, or what the point is, it throws me off quite a bit. I expect to see one thing and then see another. Maybe a solution would be to provide an option where each individual user can choose one of the other?  That would be nice.

I will never shop on Instagram, I have looked at ads, I have clicked on links, yet I have never bought anything on Instagram. I get what you‚Äôre doing, trying to make it safe for people to buy on Insta, prompt real shops and make sure people are not getting scammed (well, part of what you‚Äôre doing). If you want to make revenue that badly, the least you could do is try to not inconvenience your already loyal downloaders. Just. Ugh. If you just have to have this stupid shopping thing, can you at least switch it with the notification button? Have the shopping button be on the top right hand corner, and the notifications be on the bottom again. And while you‚Äôre at it, why don‚Äôt you move the DM button down below too, make everything super accessible.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-17T09:43:28-07:00

Thanks to the reptilian overlord race and their alien technology, today‚Äôs generation doesn‚Äôt have to worry about having to carve pictures into granite, nor whittle away at marble to write out lengthy descriptions of food. IG allows everyone the ability to snap photos of themselves, their cats, and their dinner using beautiful filters to enhance the quality of food items and/or roll back the hands of time to hide the wrinkles!

I always use it when I‚Äôm bored or want to update my status with a post, reel or addition to my story. Or even just scrolling through reels/posts and saving them to collections. However, recently certain features on my Instagram story have been removed and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it? The add yours option on my main account has been taken away from me and I can no longer use it, even when I try and click it from another persons story. Some quality issues come here and there, and sometimes when I want to save a video to a collection normally the option ‚Äúsave to collection‚Äù comes up, but just recently it has gone away again. I‚Äôve seen other people have somewhat of similar issues too but I do not know how to fix it. Is there anyone who can help me figure this out?

I wrote this a while back and I‚Äôm writing again because still more and more instagram is getting worse for me and now it won‚Äôt even work. It‚Äôs just this one account too.

The navigation of the app is odd to me and the app overall can be very glitchy. Examples‚Ä¶ now the developers know that more than likely, people use the app while they‚Äôre still in bed or about to go to bed. Naturally, swiping in the appropriate ways to use the app is UNLIKELY.  Do you know how annoying it is to get into replies that are deep in a comment section and you try to continue swiping down but it swipes right and now you‚Äôre back to the post? Another example: sometimes I can‚Äôt use create until I get out of that and go to camera mode, TAKE A PICTURE (this is a must, just coming out of create and going right back to it does nothing), and then I can use the create and sometimes I have to do this twice before it works. Why? Sound on/off not being consistent; if my volume is off for content on my news feed, why is it on sometimes when I then access stories? It‚Äôs just a hot mess atp with unnecessary changes when old bugs/issues haven‚Äôt been fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-19T07:19:44-07:00
6653487339,Liam623,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id930931752,166.1,5,Instagram does not care about their users,"Instagram‚Äôs latest update proves that the app is simply a cash grabbing scheme, disregarding the apps previous usability, in favor of a simple get-rich-quick scam. 

The vast majority of users do not use Instagram as a shopping resource. It is primarily a social media website with shopping and reels as secondary resources. If people wanted an app to shop they would use either Etsy or Tik Tok, respectively. Removing the post and feed buttons from the main task bar, in favor of shopping and reels, proves that Instagram does not care about its users. They only want to make money.

The update has absolutely no benefit for Instagram‚Äôs core audience, yet they do not seem to care. Instagram‚Äôs developers know that despite the anger some may hold regarding the update, they will still use Instagram. I urge you to delete Instagram until they revert the app to its prior format. Instagram needs to learn that its consumers bring in ad revenue and other means of income. Without us they will not make any money and until they cater to our wants, that‚Äôs exactly how it should be.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-16T16:05:02-07:00

So I try to contact this billion dollar, mega social media ‚Äòenterprise‚Äô for help and they don‚Äôt even have a support line??! Very unprofessional and appalling honestly. Now to their future: the app is no longer fun or interesting or even about its users, in fact, the algorithm now restricts your friends and family with lower follower counts and instead heavily boosts influencers, E commerce and propaganda. They took the ‚Äòaccount notification‚Äô tab and made it harder to find while replacing it with online shopping (also Instagram, the stores you promote are not good quality and half on them steal from us!)And finally, the purpose of Instagram is to share my pictures with an audience, you have restricted that and are now stealing all your ideas from other apps aka: stories from Snapchat and reels from ticktock.
