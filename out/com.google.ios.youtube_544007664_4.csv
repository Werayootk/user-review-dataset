Still break YouTube,"Wrote a review a few days ago about how vertical ads break YouTube and force you to watch the video vertically, and when you try to minimize the video, it doesn’t work. I have to restart my app, find the video again, and pray I don’t get a broken ad. It’s very sad. Please fix this. Months later this is still an issue. It’s extremely frustrating that YouTube doesn’t care to fix issues that prevent the app from working as functioned. Incompetence at its best. UPDATE: all these issues are still apparent and now when you accidentally open the capture function while watching a video, it destroys the audio quality and you have to restart the app- essentially a crash.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2024-04-01T07:53:57-07:00

Super Sensitive
3/27/24 Lately it seems that You Tube is especially sensitive and will skip on to something else when you are trying to watch something. It’s quite annoying. I don’t remember YT being that sensitive to movement. I hope there’s a fix to that. Title: Option to move the word “subscribe” around? 3/16/24 - wish we had the option to move the word “subscribe” around ‘cuz sometimes it blocks other things we do want to read. If there is a way, I’m not aware of it. I did try with my finger though but nothing moved. Not allowing comments on many of the videos:( 2/12/2024 - Ran across a Young Sheldon video clip talking about how it’s going to end and all and then says share your comments below. Um, no way to do that when You Tube has the comments turned off. What kind of monsters do you think we all are anyways? I wish instead of keeping the name Young Sheldon and killing off their dad, that maybe you just change the name of the show. I think The Cooper Family sounds pretty good, or The Coopers but you already have a similar sounding title with TheConners, tho I don’t really watch that but I would with the carry over of Sheldon’s Family. Please reconsider turning the comments back on. Is it a space issue? Otherwise, comments have been very helpful, if say, the viewer can’t recall which family member is singing a particular song. Hey, us commenters aren’t that evil. I don’t recall seeing any really bad or nasty comments.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2024-04-01T03:44:11-07:00
