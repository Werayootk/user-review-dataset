In the latest update in which you provided some cool features to group chats like “slow-mode”, it’s been a very interesting tool for group admins 

My only complaint is that the way slow-mode currently works in groups is that when activated it affects all members in the group chat unless that member is added to the exception list. 

it would be so much easier if there’s a way to literally keep the entire group chat exempted from the slow-mode an only have slow-mode affect certain individuals. 

it’s way to time consuming for admins to constantly have to make sure that all members are on that  exception list so they don’t get annoyed with the slow mode activity. 

in the next update can you please have a feature to -[ ADD ONLY ]- slow mode 
In which admins can add members to a slow mode parameters on certain individual who message WAY TO MUCH in groups. 

please respond back if you have a possible solution to this request / issue.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-09T05:28:19-07:00

Feature suggestion: it would be awesome if I could jump to the point in the standard chat where a photo was sent. Like I could tap on the picture in shared media, and there would be an option to jump to the day/time it was sent. 
Another related feature- what if I could jump to a specific time? “Hmm, what were we talking about on Nov. 4, 2019?” And I could somehow jump to the start of that day. 
One more! - what if we could “bookmark” specific moments in the chat, so we could jump back to that point and reread messages? I suppose a bookmarks section would be needed for this.

If you want to use telegram to manually 🎮 or programmatically 💻 send updates in a group chat, you can. Take a look at telegram API 🎯. 

You can also open telegram on multiple devices: computer 💻🖥, smartphone 📱and in a browser 🌎. A direct contrast with WhatsApp: you can use WhatsApp web on your computer provided it is opened on your phone as well. Telegram imposes no such limitations👍👏. You can have telegram on as many devices as you please with the same account. ✨

Now areas of ⚠️IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT⚠️:

I see a bug 🐞🪲🪳when using the video call feature between a computer and a smart phone. The video is typically rotated by 90 degrees. There should be a mechanism for the video to rotate (as the user pleases) on any side of the conversation: you may have an auto rotate feature, but being able to manually rotate it will be very useful.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-24T09:35:47-07:00
