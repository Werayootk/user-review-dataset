You can make groups, but it’s going to add and remove any channel it feels like at random (sometimes a group will break and every channel ever will be added to it up to the max, including every new one you follow—take them out, it’ll put them back). 

You can pay for premium, but sometimes it’ll glitch out and pretend you didn’t (limiting your pins to the regular arbitrary number until you restart). I’ve had it happen with the number of channels you can follow too.

You even try to do something as simple as re-order your pins, and the editor only works for two moves (at which point it starts only moving it one space per grab & then dropping it or it just refreshes you to the top of the screen with nothing moved).

If this simple stuff were fixed, it’d be 5 stars from me. I don’t like them caving to Big Tech censorship, but I do like that they’ve preserved the integrity of the web version at least. It’s so frustrating dealing with these obnoxious bugs though. And there’s no such thing as support. It’s completely non-responsive (they’re as likely to look at your message as X is to read your appeal), which is a little crazy when you’re paying for something.

I sincerely hope this app can be cleaned up because it really does crush the competition in many ways.
