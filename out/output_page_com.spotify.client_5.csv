So the app is AMAZINGG the only thing that I have against it is that just bcuz we (referring to the don’t have premium)don’t have premium, does NOT mean u keep have to spam ads. Idk if it is just me, but every time I skip a song or it just finishes, it plays an ad. At first it wasn’t like this, it played an ad or two here and there. But I really didn’t think it would get this bad.( plus some of them r kinda 
inappropriate sometimes)Not to mention that we can’t play a certain song that fits the vibe and cannot go back to the previous song. (I am truly sorry if I am complaining rn but I had to say something about it that’s just how I am.) Listen, all I am really trying to say is that you should give more to the non-premium users.

Yes, I love how this app has practically EVERY song and genre, and nor do u have to pay to get just a single song to listen to! Now, I’ve been using this app for a few years now and the new update that they NOT recently released pretty much ruined it. For example: Whenever I search up a song that I would like to just simple listen to from the search bar, it plays a completely different one! Please PLEASE fix this!! It is so irritating. Another thing is that you guys removed the “repeat” button for when you want to listen to a song on repeat. Help! Lastly; before his update, whenever I opened for clicked on a playlist, it would open the playlist and show you all the songs, top to bottom, BUT NOW.. it doesn’t even do that! It just shows empty space and the title and info of the playlist and lists but doesn’t show the songs involved!

So many people have talked so highly about this app and i have been nothing but disappointed. You only get 6 skips a day which is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard, you cant play a specific song you literally can only shuffle your playlist (which, don’t forget, you only get 6 skips so if you want to listen to a specific song, you cant.) and i got 3 full ads before i even had a chance to listen to a single song. This app is completely useless without paying, which is just gross. It is 100% obvious you only care about money and not at all about the listeners, as you take every basic function of a music app and make it so it HAS to be paid for.

But this one thing is keeping me from rating this app any higher than 3 stars. I love whenever I can play my music in order, sometimes I just don’t like when it plays in shuffle mode. But the last update has changed so I cannot choose if I want it in shuffle mode or not. And before the update if I slid right it would put that song in queue. And if I slid left then it would favorite the song, but not anymore. 

This last update has really gotten on my nerves and I rarely listen to music anymore. If you would just let us choose if we’d like it in shuffle or not, I believe many people would be happy. I say that we should click ‘play’ then it should ask “How would you like your music to play?” Then underneath that it should have two buttons, one says ‘shuffle’ and the other says ‘in order’. This would make life much more happier for me.

Is anyone else having this problem?? It started happening a few months ago and I’ve been waiting for whatever bug this is to get fixed, and it hasn’t. Not every single song does it, but most of them do, and it’s not a particular artist, it’s just random. Note: If I look up that song by that artist, the song will play just fine.

Instead of auto playing the individual podcasts that I’ve added to my playlist, the app will either play ALL of the podcasts in numerical order (even ones I did not add to my playlist), or play random podcasts, including ones I’ve already listened to and are labeled “played”.

So the weird thing is that on my iPad this does not happen but on my phone it does so I don’t know what is up with that.

You can buy premium and don’t have to worry about limited skips and handpick the songs you want to listen at that moment. The main problem with this app is that it randomly stops playing music at 9-11 seconds. At first I thought I let was a connection issue but when I connected to the Wi-Fi at my home it also stops. I tried to restart the app but that didn’t work. The only way I was able to get the songs to start playing again was deleting and downloading the app back.

I can’t choose a specific song or play anything on repeat. And when I search for a certain song, all that pops up is the album the song is from. And even then I can’t pick the song I want or skip to it, I have to listen to the album until it gets to the song I’m looking for. I’m allowed ONLY 6 skips and then I have to wait a whole HOUR to get more. Usually it takes more than 6 skips to get to the song I want. Referring back to the ‘stuck on shuffle’ issue.. when my playlist “ends” it doesn’t actually end. It starts playing random songs. I feel like once the playlist ends it shouldn’t start playing random songs, it should just stop playing songs all together until you start playing another song or restart the playlist.

These last few updates have been rather reductive and if they continue to degrade I WILL find another app to use for my music. I highly recommend the company roll back some of its cosmetic changes to the app because they ARENT good changes.

Previously, when I only saved select songs from an album those were the only songs that showed in my library. Now, when I go to the albums in my library every track on an album will show in my library, regardless of what songs I actually saved—even if I only saved one song from the album the whole thing is there. This really complicates my playback flow and makes it hard to download only portions of an album for offline listening.

On my iPhone, you can set a timer for how long the phone can stay on before it falls asleep if you don’t click for five minutes or so. Since the app stays running when the phone is off, I’d like some sort of system like that. Maybe you can just have a menu where you click, “play for 15 minutes before stopping” or whatever.

I do wish that it were a bit more like Pandora in the way that you can have 1 song on replay for about 10 minutes. Also, the “only 6 skips an hour” rule is not great. Most of the time, I watch an add, and then I listen to my music, however it never plays the song that I want to listen to first thing. Which is why the 6 skips rule, doesn’t work. I do like that you can find all the music ever on here. But the last main thing is, apparently, there is no such thing as having a playlist of less than 15 songs that you chose. Because every time you make a new playlist, it adds songs that IT “thinks” you would like to fill it to 15 songs! That is not always a good move. I have just stopped trying to make playlists at this point because of this. I know it sounds like I’m ranting, but I’m just telling you how it is.

For example I haven’t listened to the oldest thing on my recently played in many months maybe even a year.

Music is probably one if the most important arts humans can interact with and therefore creating a computer who makes a designated library will most likely never create what the app needs to have the user fall in love with the app instantly. In other words is like you have to fight with the app searching and that feature is most likely issued once a person becomes a member. I think it should be offered for free. I wouldn’t mind paying to create a library that would find and play only the music I really care to listen to. Instead the app acts like elevator background sound and lacks passion due to the lack of personalisation of options that would speak to me.

It’s allowed me to find so many new songs that I adore and also create some banger playlists. As someone who listens to music religiously, and especially in the car, I’ve come across a problem. When I’m driving and I have my playlist enhanced, if a new song starts playing, it’s quite difficult to find that song in the playlist so that I can click the + button to add it. So I propose two new ideas! 

1) a “quick add” feature so that you can add the enhanced song to your playlist directly while you’re viewing the song in full screen, which would also add the 3 recommended songs

2) a “show this song in playlist” feature that automatically scrolls to the right spot in your playlist, allowing you to click the + button and then see the 3 recommended songs after

This would drastically increase the quality of life for me and others who listen to music all the time, but aren’t always able to spend a minute scrolling through my 20 hour long playlist trying to carefully spot the song that’s playing. Obviously I could just use the 3 dots and click “add to playlist” but then I don’t get the 3 recommended songs!!!

I can deal with ads and limited skips, or pay for premium. It isn't perfect and it has its issues but I want to specifically address this one. 
The way the playlist radio functions is absolute garbage unless you pay for premium. If you like a song, you can never undo that action and liked songs will repeatedly show up when you use the radio, thus forcing you to listen to it or waste one of your already limited skips. I have songs I liked months ago still showing up, regardless of whether they're in my playlist or not. Songs that I don't want to hear constantly.

The songs are arranged by their v i b e s  and if it gets mixed up the playlist just doesn’t work and sometimes I just want to listen to the songs in the order they are in and I don’t want to shuffle them.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-20T19:57:07-07:00

Like you are able to sort songs into your own playlists and follow your favorite artists. However, this is app is not perfect. The fact that you are able to sort songs in playlists is great, but I find it frustrating how random songs will “recommend” or just play random songs that you have probably never even heard of or put into your playlists. Also, the ads are too much. For example, the “30 minutes of no ads” ad pops up every two or so songs. And if you  choose not to to watch the short video, two or three ads will come up afterwards as to say “You should have watched the video”. If this were more like the desktop version, where you able to pick your songs, get unlimited amount of skips,  rewind or skip into songs, all while have a pretty small amount of ads compared to the mobile version, I think this app would be much more enjoyable to use whenever.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-21T12:48:05-07:00

It seems the playlists want at least 15 songs in them or the fill the rest with crap you don’t want to hear.  Then it only plays the crappy songs and they only allow 6 skips a day. If it just wants to play the crappy ones I might as well just tune in to a radio station I don’t like and save myself the trouble of making all the cool playlists.  I’m not getting to listen to what I want anyway...

Need to allow 20-30 skips a day & allow smaller playlists.  Also getting to listen to one full length song of your choice, instead of waiting to hear it after going through the entire playlist would really help with ones frustration when using the app.  Fixing 2 or 3 small problems would make this a really cool app, don’t even mind the ads, but the way it is I am being generous in giving this 2 stars out of 5...",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-21T17:17:58-07:00
