I Highly recommend!","text":"My 1st order I was a little skeptical that the quality would be very good because the prices are almost too good to be true! But I figured it wasn’t much money so if the clothes were bad quality I wasn’t loosing much. Then my 1st order came and I was SHOCKED! The quality was WAY better than I expected! I have continued to get many things from them and never once have I gotten anything of bad quality. Every order has been exactly what was pictured! I ended up getting my wedding dress from them! I was on a very short time frame, and couldn’t get one sent from anyone but then in time. I was still a bit worried cause hey, this is a dress for my wedding, not just regular clothes. I payed a little (not much) extra for faster shipping and it came, exactly as pictured, early and really good quality! Sense then I have been hooked! I am always impressed with the quality, prices and short time it takes to come! If you haven’t tried them, you deff should give them a shot! Another thing I like is on almost all the clothes, people leave reviews at them bottom, and most of the time they will take pictures with the reviews. That way you get a better idea of what the clothes look like and what they look like on other people, not just models. That always is helpful in helping me make a decision! I Highly recommend SHEIN and LOVE this app!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-31T09:26:23-07:00"},{"id":"9437981061","userName":"kaayyy23","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id699404064","version":"8.8.1","score":5,"title":"absolutely obsessed","text":"i have been buying clothes from SheIn for almost 2 yrs now and out of the 75+ items i've purchased i've only ever had sizing issues once & tbh once i looked back at the size chart it was totally my mistake anyway lol. i had a friend take all my measurements one day and the reality of shopping with exact measurements so easily visible is delightful! the quality of the clothes has shocked me - i used to buy $25+ tshirts from other retailers & have had better luck with SheIn's $8 shirts lasting longer and holding up better in the wash ! i have IBS and my weight always fluctuates & ilove the fact that this sites clothes are so affordable because i'm able to stay stylish at all my weights without breaking my pockets! i recently (finally) gained 15lbs after YEARS of not being able to gain weight & replaced sooooo many clothes in my wardrobe with SheIn ! my bf loves them & always compliments my outfits & i've even had strangers compliment them too ! my fav retailer hands down !!! the ONLY thing icould complain about is their return policy - they only allow you free return for your first return and any return after that they will deduct about $12 from the total spent on that item & give you the difference as a credit or refund. again - with the accuracy of the sizing chart , i've almost never had to return anything but do wish it was free returns no matter what","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-26T13:49:00-07:00"},{"id":"6835190612","userName":"vinarris","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id940057754","version":"7.4.2","score":5,"title":"LEGIT","text":"100% legit site for fashionable affordable clothing. I’ve been purchasing for the last 2 years or more now with at least 20 + items each purchase and have never been cheated or disappointed. Customer service has always been above and beyond for me, they always get back to me and never had an issue with returning items that didn’t fit (if they’re eligible for return, not everything is but they tell you before checkout what isn’t) my closet is about 85% SHEIN clothing and shoes and the rest mall bought clothing. I prefer SHEIN over anything lately. Quality is usually amazing but be sure to read reviews and picture reviews before purchasing. Once I found my size in SHEIN it’s made shopping easier with less returns. Returns for US are free (at least I’ve never paid for any) so that’s another plus. They’re usually fast with shipping but with COVID I’ve been getting them like 3-4 weeks later. Which is understandable given what’s going on. But once things are back to normal it’s usually 1-2 weeks. I’ve only ever had 2 packages lost in the mail due to COVID which they happily replaced, no problem and sent out new for me. I did eventually end up getting the first “lost” packages though. You never know until you give it a try for yourself. I’m definitely glad I did. They except PAYPAL which is much more comforting when you’re a new buyer, since they cover you. I love this app/store. 10+ stars.

I read so many complaints about cheap material, clothing smelling, irregular size I could go on. I needed a Indian inspired outfit for a wedding in Dec 2021 and didn’t want to spend a lot. My niece persuaded me to look on the app. Needless to say I found something beautiful and very affordable. Idk what Shein the people are complaining about. I have made a purchase practically every month since my first order( help I need a intervention 😏). I’ve sent back items never because of the above mentioned complaints. It was either I didn’t get the size right or the way it fitted on me. Every size 14 doesn’t fit the same on every size 14 body. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Shipping is definitely fast. I had one delay in shipping contact customer service and was assured my item was coming. Even with the delay the item still came within the time frame. People also have to remember the time difference. When your up and about customer service for them is closed. For the people sitting on the fence nothing wrong with reading the reviews I do all the time. But don’t let that stop you. Try it yourself as I finally did. Hopefully you’ll be satisfied as I am.

I asked her how it worked and she gave me some pointers on reviews and points and filtering….move forward 3 hours and I had a cart of super cute things and a wishlist a mile long! I ordered that night, got an instant 20% off if my order and when it arrived about a week later, I was so stoked and amaZed at the quality that I had to post about it! I was a retail store manager for Justice at the time and was referring the moms to Shein when we went back in. When we closed, I referred the moms to the site for the kids clothing as well! I have been hooked since then! You do have to read reviews and look at the foundations of the merchandise. It states whether it is stretchy or has a zipper. Customer service is always amazing and quick and so very polite! I have not yet been dissatisfied with anything here and I have had about 120 orders so far with 6 waiting to arrive. I RECOMMEND THIS SITE TO EVERYONE!!! And don’t get me started on the cute bags! The shoes have been great as well, though sometimes pricey….I wait for clearance and flash sales😉 CHECK IT OUT NOW!

When I was looking through it I was not impressed at first, because the clothes are very nice but the prices are very cheap. I said the quality of these clothes are not worth it, until I had to get ready for a huge birthday party theme. The only place fitting the theme for this party was Shien, so my girlfriends and I took a chance and started ordering merchandise and clothes. Our shipment came to us in 3 days and less. We tried the clothes on and was in shock. The clothes not only looked nice but the quality wasn’t cheap either, however their clothes are not true to size not saying it was bad. It made us feel extra great returning the clothes for a smaller size. The customer service person was so awesome. I had to turn in an outfit that was out of stock and she literally helped me try to find something close to what I wanted. The exchange was super easy and getting the right size did not take long at all. My husband loves the clothes here as well, so good bye Walmart, Target and other quick shopping stores. Shien has gained a true shopping customer with me. The only problem I see is this site needs to keep more things in stock, because a lot of pretty clothing sales out really quick. Good job Shien and keep up the good work, I’m truly impressed with this site and the customer service.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-13T10:02:27-07:00"},{"id":"8874660125","userName":"angervscouser2000","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1224530102","version":"8.3.4","score":5,"title":"absolutely love and recommend!!","text":"I have been using shein for almost 2 years now and have never had a complaint. Shein is very affordable and very good quality products i do typically buy clothes and accessories and i have loved all of them ! When using the app you can put in all your size preferences (make sure you’re logged in to the account you use) so you can always compare those to what size you’re looking to get (exp. if you click on Small 0-2 it will tell you the measurements and you can compare them to yours). I feel the app is more smooth running than shopping in a browser online. There are always reviews for you to look at too which i love and when you’re logged in to your account Shein puts together items they think you would like and i absolutely love that! When you write a review on things you purchased you earn shein points which you can use to discount what you buy next! I do recommend you always read the reviews based on the ones of people who bought your size or the sizes you wear to compare the item to yourself to see how it will look/fit. I also love how much of a wide variety of things you can buy such as home decor, clothes, shoes, underwear, bras, sticky bras, makeup, accessories and so much more and all such at a reasonable price! Shein is 102% worth it 😁","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-14T16:46:51-07:00"},{"id":"9766994004","userName":"Apple iPhone Lover","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117060329","version":"9.0.6","score":3,"title":"Some good some bad","text":"Took me a while to order from SHEIN. I had a lot of fun ordering costume jewelry some of it’s good some of it is not so good… the clothes are hit or miss. Some made really well, some just have to be thrown in the garbage. A lot of it fits weird. Poorly finished seams. Sweatshirts are good. I will say that the shoes I’ve ordered from Big Tree brand are very comfortable. Some have a weird fit in the heel but for the price.,. You know… you get what you pay for. As long as you just buy fun things you’ll be ok. Wish it was better. Wish there was more leather made shoes and belts. Most of the pleather looks cheap. Also I don’t understand why they photoshop women with tiny waists and rear ends that look like two basketballs. So obvious and you’d be hard pressed to find actual women that look like that, much less clothes that are actually tailored appropriately to fit such a weird shape. They need to stop.\nUPDATE:  just received a reply from the developer. Not sure why you’d apologize for “inconvenience”… what inconvenience?  Is that a standard answer you give everyone?  I’ve given you my point of view about the products. Not your app.  I will say that in the world we live in, it’s time to stop photoshopping women’s rear ends and hips to look like they do in the pictures. It’s ridiculous.  Rarely will you meet normal, everyday women (your client base) who look like that.  We are real women - not 18” waist and 44” hips.  Do better.  We would appreciate it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-30T00:14:02-07:00"},{"id":"7911234520","userName":"phoenix291","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1083574307","version":"7.8.3","score":4,"title":"Give it a try","text":"So I have mixed feelings with this website. I absolutely LOVE the variety of styles, designs, and choices for unbeatable prices. I can get a really cool and unique shirt on here for $15 at the most, where most top brands you pay $55 for a plain T shirt. Yes, the quality of clothes are good from everything I’ve bought. Most of my wardrobe is from SHEIN. The clothes are real and legit. The material always varies but I’ve gotten some really soft shirts and nothing is too obviously cheap material. The jeans are really good and cheap as well. \nNow for the problems with this app:\nI’m only 115 pounds and almost everything I order ends up being too small. I’m normally a medium but on here I have to order almost everything in large. I think it’s cause I have a big chest. I would really like to see a section for big chested girls. Next, I really don’t like supporting the environmental destruction that fast fashion causes. I see that they are starting to implement more clothes made of recycled material. If they could aim to switch to at least 50% being recycled then this would be my favorite brand in the world. Last, the recommendation system needs to be worked on because even though there’s hundreds of thousands of styles on here, it seems like the app only shows me the same 20 or so things in my recommendations. I wanna see more variety. Overall very good app if you need affordable clothing.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-10-13T12:39:06-07:00"},{"id":"7490797123","userName":"joseiasashin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id612583228","version":"7.6.2","score":5,"title":"Shein review","text":"Honestly I love this app, although I wish you could leave reviews without ordering it. Simply because I get all my clothes through my moms account, but I have my own just to put things in my cart then go through/check them and if she approves I add them to hers so she can order them. I’d like to be able to leave reviews on my own account, as I would like to earn points and be able to help other people find their perfect fit (ladies if you are around 160, 5’4/5’5  and 34C VS size, the xl high waisted bathing suits will fit you perfect). Like if you could like take a picture of the bathing suit and then submit it as proof you purchased it and then you could leave a review, that would be really cool. Or if you could just leave your review under the item instead of having to go through your orders and leave reviews there that would be cool. Overall it’s a 5/5 from me because I love the clothes, and they’re mostly high quality. If you’re looking to start buying clothes from here, please check the reviews to make sure you know what you’re buying, some people leave pictures so you can see it on someone and it also tells you what size they got and some people tell you their body size as a guide.

There’s so much to buy from clothes, to home decor, to jewelry and to much more! I ordered and few things from their and wearing one of them as I type this! The material changes based on what you buy to make sure you read the reviews for the best quality. But from what I ordered the quality is great! The shipping isn’t bad either it estimated 2 weeks for me but it came about 5 days earlier than expected! Easy to return and replace items that don’t fit well not what you expected it to be. The product measurements are accurate for the most part and I love how it recommends you size based on what people of your similar body type likes and returned! Overall I have had a very great experience for shein and can’t wait to order more items! Def recommend!! 💗😁\n\nAlso a quick suggestion. When looking at reviews I would love to be able to filter them based on what size/ color people got.  Sometimes I like to see how a size fits on people my size and how to color looks like. It takes me forever to see enough information based on my size and my personal fit preference and it makes it would make it a lot easier for me and I’m sure for others when trying to pick the perfect size and or color when looking at reviews. 😁","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-22T06:18:30-07:00"},{"id":"8794463719","userName":"Aerinn0404","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112758742","version":"8.2.6","score":5,"title":"Thankful","text":"I’m a stay at home mom and we’re a single income family in a two income nation. It’s fantastic to be able to find a huge selection of clothing I can afford. There are so many feminine, pretty things that actually fit me and make me feel beautiful. I think I’m on my fifth order so far and I really haven’t been disappointed.\n\nI did a lot of reading around the internet prior to purchasing. I think the SHEIN success phenomenon has really made other garment manufacturers upset. Shady treatment of laborers by corporations having their clothing made in Vietnam, India, or Haiti has been going on for decades with little press, and yet SHEIN gets a ton of negative attention. I find myself doubting SHEIN’s workers are more poorly compensated and treated than workers in countries with weaker economies and lower standards of living than China. I do believe they must work very, very hard. \n\nThat said, the app is easy to navigate, the measurements of each garment clearly marked, and for everything misrepresented by photos of women photoshopped into the garment, there’s often a photo of a real woman in the reviews wearing it to give a better idea of the lay of the fabric and the actual fit on a real human with normal proportions. I love that they accept multiple methods of payment, ship quickly, and offer lots of customer support.

Some things can be really cute, some things are total junk. It’s a better bet than Aliexpress, though. But keep in mind the prices are so low because the conditions and pay for workers in the factories the items are made in are usually abominable at best. \nThe app itself…is annoying to say the least. The “win a prize” section is bizarre, since all of the little games they have that users can play to “win” credits basically never work, even when you read through the rules and follow the directions within the time limit (You will NEVER win the $300 credit that requires 500 diamonds to be collected to win, it will never count the referral codes when the person you share with downloads the app and enters it, somehow, despite it being within the same hour, it gets counted by the app as being past the time limit 😒 what a surprise). But I wouldn’t go so far as to say the games are scammy, since there’s nothing lost by playing them, you just don’t have any real chance of winning anything more than a $5 off coupon.

My only concern is how long it takes for shipping if you want your stuff within 3 to 5 days definitely don’t expect that from shein. On shein it takes about a week to get your stuff and maybe even two but that just seems to be my only complaint they have events like free shipping and ways to get points and the points are used to take a little bit of money off your order, which is really great, another thing I would like to say is on some of the games or events when they give you coupons. The coupon range is extremely ridiculous 5% off over $149. I never use those but from time to time they’ll give you a free 15% off coupon for any amount that you buy, they also give you free points when you order stuff. all in all I think it’s a really good app. They just have a few cons. Mostly the fact that there shipping takes forever, but the quality is really good and the prices are really low. I could get like 8 necklaces on here for like three dollars and the quality of the necklaces will be really good. I think Shein  is a really good app and it has Gone really far. But there’s a rumor that they use child labor I don’t know if it’s true, but I just felt like that he needs to be known.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-21T13:51:50-07:00"},{"id":"7618609661","userName":"Charlie@ATX","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41010782","version":"7.7.0","score":5,"title":"Shameless :(","text":"This is undoubtably gast fashion!

The customer service is why I gave the stars! The best costumer service Ive ever experienced. Honestly! Quality- I think its really fair for the price. Truly! That said the prices are concerningly low, like my clothes budget. And ive washed a pair of jeans like 30 times and the amount of blue comming off of them still!!! Its crazy! All the clothes need to be color sorted and don't forget! \n\nMy shame in buying them is like a desperatley hungry vegan eating meat! I need no contact clothes (for my whole family) I can afford during covid while were on one income , I honestly don't think its any worse than target or Walmart! Not that Thise are good standards, The prices are right. The style is relevant. They have an enormous (seemingly endless) selection. Size inclusive! Practices are the problem! like with any mass clothes retailer! I send everything on to thrift and thread up. Even my toddlers clothes that are also so cute and soooo affordable. \n\nDesperate times!

I’ve never had any issues with any of my items, I buy lots of clothing and makeup and accessories home goods etc. I would reccomend them always to anyone!

Sometimes I’ve gotten my orders even just a week or sooner after I’ve ordered! And I’ve lived in multiple different states! If there’s something wrong with your corset support is quick and reliable to help resolve the issue.

Don’t bother playing games.  You will only help Shein get new people joining Shein, but Shein will cheat when you are close to win the prize.  Playing sponsored games is like working for Shein, right.  You invite people and for them to accept your invitation they need to download Shein app and creating their account.  You basically get rewarded by successfully referring Shein to the new people. I was only .02 diamonds to win $200.  I had to spend time on getting people to accept my invitation to get there at .02 diamonds away. When you are this close to win, they only give you .01 diamonds if you get a new user with a device that downloaded Shein app for the first time.  That means I only needed two new people.  So my 3 friends downloaded the first time and created their brand new accounts and accepted my invitation.  Guess what I got?  “Your friend is unable to help due to security issues”.   All 3 new users that downloaded Shein app on their 3 devices for the first time should have credited me .03 diamonds, but i got nothing.  I reached out for Shein to make it right, but Shein refused by trying to bring up the wrong reason saying your friends can’t help if they’ve already helped someone else.  I kept letting them know that my final 3 friends never downloaded Shein app and never had Shein account before I invited them.  No excuses, Shein.

Sometimes, you luck out and get something really nicely made, and sometimes, you get a super thin, see-through piece 2 sizes too big.  Unlike most other stores, I’ve noticed most of their items tend to run a little large instead of small, which in my opinion is not always a bad thing. Being plus size, it’s often difficult to find stylish, form-fitting, clothing that I personally like. Everything made in my size is always huge, has ugly slogans on it like “#BOSSBABE”, or has an ugly cut/shape. Everything on SHEIN is modern and fashionable. My only gripe with this site is it’s so difficult for me to find things in my correct size. I know I’m normally a 2X and I always do extensive research on each piece before purchasing, but for some reason, I still manage to get the wrong size often. I wish they would work on this and help make the sizing and quality more consistent. Either way, give it a shot! It’s worth trying out their clothing for yourself. Everything is super affordable and their outfits are so cute! Just make sure you read all the reviews as well as the size chart to figure out which size you should be purchasing.\nGood luck and happy shopping! ☺️🥰","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-09-12T22:09:52-07:00"},{"id":"7392658444","userName":"Shaunabob","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id367336376","version":"7.5.8","score":5,"title":"Newly Infatuated and Obsessed With Shein","text":"I recently discovered this store/site as I was searching for an affordable curvy plus size dress to wear for an upcoming wedding and not only have I found an abundance of dress options, there is so much more!

Love that you get points earned toward money off your order. The only thing I really dislike is some of the pictures. They photoshop them so much it can have a negative impact on your buying experience when you get the items and they don’t look like that on YOU (a real person). But the reviews customers leave with pictures of themselves wearing the item really helps to counteract that. Also the photoshopped pictures aren’t even done that well as you can see disfigured arms when they pinch in their waists, or disfigure their necks as they enhance their chest size. The other thing about the pictures of the models is that they can tend to show very inappropriate poses or show nearly all their private parts. You do have the option to report the image, but there’s no reason for them to be on there in the first place. But that is my only true complaint.

It’s a final item so I ate that one. After all everything looks cute with jeans right?  I also order a pink fuzzy coat which I have never received.  The order itself has disappeared from my account so I can’t even trace it. I tried calling Shein and that’s even more of a joke. The number listed isn’t a working number. Then I tried your chat box. What a mess!?!?!  I’m trying to find my missing coat and the chat box transferred me to a website for account problems that would charge me a refundable $1 fee. Was I not supposed to notice the $45 per month automatic fee!?!?!  Enough with the scams people.  When I tried to answer your boxed questions y’all had the nerve to ask me if one of my neighbors may have this mistakenly got the package.  VERY unlikely since I’ve never had that problem at this address. The only trace to this coat is IN MY BANK ACCOUNT.   You had no problem getting paid!   I am warning all of you.

You can change your entire style or get a completely new wardrobe…and still do it affordably. Personally I think it is even better than Romwe….I’m not sure of the connection between the two, I think they are sister brands. But it has more styles!! They add new stuff all the time, and the company runs very smoothly in my opinion. All their customer service is great. For suggestions, I would recommend that you can filter reviews by measurements. Ex: height. Sometimes I need to see how LONG the pants are. But not just height you could also do weight, etc. Lastly, does anyone know the meaning behind the name? Is it “She-in” as in the styles or some person being fashionable…or is it simply based on some name of Asian descent?

At first, I didn't buy from them because I thought it would be one of those sites that uses cheap material and takes ages to ship but I was wrong. The quality of their clothes blows me away every time that I shop, and the affordability. I can bulk order many items, and I have the option to pay in weekly installments. Most of the clothes are true to size, and only very few maybe a tad bit small. Their shipping to NY is very quick, sometimes within a week of ordering I'd get it, but definitely no longer than 2 weeks. Due to COVID, they also sanitize the clothing and packing inside of the main one which I think is great, of course we can sanitize ourselves upon receiving. Another great perk is that with every purchase we make, we earn points which can be used as a discount. Every 100 = $1, it sounds like a lot which means a penny a point, but the clothing cost is very cheap, so it's only fair, plus they have extra discounts on top of the amazing prices. I hope they continue with their affordable prices and great quality.

For one, I think on the app you should be able to select the date under the “new in” section like you are able to on the traditional website format. This would allow me to look at the app every day and filter to see what new stuff was added, without having to search through all the other “new in” items I saw the day before, and 2 days prior, etc. I also think it would be best if the “check in” to earn your points popped up as soon as you opened up the app- like many game apps do for “daily tokens” and whatnot, because even though I’m on the app at least once a day I usually don’t remember to go to the check in page to earn my points. Finally, I think the main search feature should have an option to filter just “plus size” because currently you can search for an item description and filter it to a size of your choosing, for example 1XL, but a lot of the time I will buy a size smaller or bigger than my general size based on size descriptions, so I’d like to see all the plus size options available without also seeing the clothes that come in only straight sizes.

BUT they don’t only sell clothing, they sell kitchen wear, home and living, cloths, shoes, bags, jewelry, toys and gifts! Shein is my go to when i’m giving presents! They have everything a girl or guy would ever need! it’s super easy to get points! (100p=1$) they even have baby cloths!!!\nthis app is totally worth it!!! it’s free and i love it!!! ITS SO CHEAP!!! i’m a broke teenager in high school, so this app helps me buy cute cloths that i can afford!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-18T07:39:19-07:00"},{"id":"6568123631","userName":"Alymarcm","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1108931301","version":"7.3.2","score":1,"title":"Disappointed","text":"So I saw this on Facebook like all ads that are posted there. I was a bit skeptical since I had also purchased cheap items on wish and on My Ali if that’s how it’s spelled. I think shopping on SHEIN is fairly easy you find a lot of beautiful items for a very low price. Although as k scrolled down to find the items I was looking for and purchasing them well the days passed and passed and passed until on SHEIN it marked that my package had arrived and  i don’t know about you guys but when you buy something online it’s like you live a roller coaster of emotions. Because it’s the time to reveal if you actually spent you money on something you’ll like. Now you run a risk purchasing on line because you know you might not get something that’s actually nice but instead it will reflect the money you paid. It’s been a couple of days after I received the notice that my package had been delivered and well nothing so I sent a notice through their app notifying that I hadn’t received the item. Well it’s been a few more days and I still have gotten no notice on the package or to where it could be. I spent roughly 60 dls on items I was planning on using. Well I’m a bit disappointed on the customer service. I hope I can come back here and updated on what happened with my items or if i will even get my money back. Well people careful on what you buy and sometimes I guess if you run with my bad luck you won’t receive your package.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-10-24T00:57:58-07:00"},{"id":"7061132354","userName":"🙄Dylan🙄","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id653481233","version":"7.4.8","score":3,"title":"It’s okay","text":"Most of the clothes are good quality. Shipping, and tax is ridiculous though. They give you coupons and points to take away from your overall total, but if It takes away “too much” they add back the shipping, even though you had high enough priced items to get free shipping. Shipping times are really long, normally its a few weeks. The delivering and updates is weird, as sometimes the information for when it updates the packages, put it on the wrong date and is pretty confusing. I like that you can earn points, and that the reviews help quite a bit. Although, when you review something you never really see your review again, and can’t change or edit it , it doesn’t show up. It’s weird that they give you a shipping fee, then add on a shipping guarantee; you’d think the shipping fee would already guarantee that you’d get your package. They offer shipping express, but it’s like buying another item because it’s 13 dollars, to get it there only a few days earlier than the standard shipping. For example, in my shipping right now, standard says it’d get here 15-17, express days, 12-13. And I mean some people would think that’s a pretty good deal, for me though, compared to other apps where you pay for shipping like that, you’d get your packages in a few days. Overall, it’s not a bad app. It’s legit.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-03-03T09:26:17-07:00"},{"id":"9357931873","userName":"bdhmoon","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1444088286","version":"8.7.4","score":1,"title":"Terrible","text":"So, I heard so many good things about this app regarding price and how the clothes looks and fits like the photos. So on cyber monday when they were having sales, I decided why not? Wouldnt hurt to buy some clothes. I purchased several pieces and used my apple pay to pay for the clothes. 2-3 days later i receive an email with them cancelling 2 of my orders and then putting one of my bigger orders on hold saying something about risk system? Look, i get it, tons of orders probably piled up during Black Friday and cyber monday sales, but if youre running a sale, the company should have better prepared for it instead of cancelling orders. Also, the order on hold states i have to show proof that i purchased it in order for them to continue processing the order… uh.. shouldnt verification of card and buyer been done at the registration portion of the whole app? Not after purchasing and cleared transaction portion? Ugh IF i even ever get any of the things i purchased on this site, i am immediately deleting this app and never using it again. And hopefully this isnt some scam \n\n Update: Not the shein app company copy pasting the same response to their 1 star reviewers. Look, if you really want people to respect and appreciate a company and change their mind about how they feel about the company, you listen to the clients compaints and address them individually instead of copy pasting a generic response","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-03T16:53:57-07:00"},{"id":"10158503680","userName":"Riley Prowler","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id162329751","version":"9.3.8","score":1,"title":"I repeat : DO NOT BUY THIS APP","text":"I know that in hindsight this app looks like a very good app for saving money, but SHEIN is a horrible business interfering with child labor, and the prices are so low because they need to fund their workers with less pay for working in small sheds literally the entire day to fit the small prices that are presented to us. Recently, SHEIN has been inviting fashion influencers from TikTok,YouTube, etc. to visit their “ headquarters.” To show how their workers ship out products even having the influencers saying things that resolve directly to the issue of “trusting” SHEIN, instead of providing us with improvement along the lines of their progress. It is so frustrating that SHEIN is literally still up and running, despite ex-workers speaking out about how the rumors are true. And by the way, the company literally uses certain fabrics/ materials that literally can cause cancer. Horrible Ik. But SHEIN is also copying other people’s products, such as this “acne patch” that is clearly copying the Hero cosmetics packaging. And it is not just hero cosmetics, but I have also seen multiple other brands that are complaining of SHEIN copying their products as well. \n\nSHEIN is not what it looks to be at all and luckily, more awareness has been shared about SHEIN. I don’t know if this review will do much, but I hope it helps just one person to delete this app. Thank you for making it this long and have a great day.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-19T10:49:15-07:00"},{"id":"8496611126","userName":"cuban peach","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1128851486","version":"8.0.6","score":5,"title":"Amazing","text":"I will admit some of things ordered have been kind of janky fabric too thin not as advised when arrived or sizes being way too small than needed but that’s only 1/10 \nOverall this app to me is winning over all the others simply by meeting all needs wonderful prices on top of my favorite (the coupons) they offer when it’s time to check out which to me is one of the reasons i continuously find myself ordering more than i should lol but their clothes a good 90%of the time are flawless spot on and are eye catching they also speak to all walks men/teens/pre-teens/ect the reviews always help and you earn points as well which at the end of all the coupons and final price you can apply the points and BOOM more money saved i swear I’m highly addicted me and my girls even my fiancé finds things that appeal to him and he’s now a fan the whole family benefits from this app absolutely love oh!!!

The first problem was that, I couldn’t log into my account on the new phone because of my password. And I even had the password saved in my notes to remember. So, they sent me a reset email. I had to do that a couple of times until they stopped sending it to my spam folder. So I was finally able to actually click the reset link. It worked (thank goodness 🙄.) \n\nHowever, when I finally signed in on the new phone, everything from my order history, wishlist items, shopping bag, and other account information were missing. It was like it started a brand new account, even though it was the same email account. I’ve always had this problem with SHEIN, having to create new accounts. And so now I have to use my old phone for managing the orders. I really wish I could use my current for phone for all of that instead having to go back and forth.\n\nIn the end, it’s a great app, I love the clothing options but, I would really appreciate it if they could somehow make logging in on various devices more efficient or maybe even add an option where you can ‘Sign in using Google’ to eliminate the hassle of having to remember and/or resetting passwords every now and then.

I heard about what they were doing but i took careful precautions and nothing bad has happened. Most of the clothes are good quality and are exactly like the picture. Shein is actually a hit or miss, but 75% of the time it’s a hit! I add so many things to my cart and wish i can get most of the things on there but i spend too much 😔 I decided to rate this app that way hopefully with the money they’re receiving they can pay their workers more and make even better clothing 😍 When i tell you i was broke after shopping, i was BROKE. Even the cards were screaming. My first package took 9 days while the second one is on the way! Highly recommend buying this and using codes, and when you receive them, rate, take pics, write reviews, and fill in the sizing guide to earn points to save. That way if you have no money like me after spending so much on clothes and accessories, you can save a lil sis!

Every day I dress in clothes that I absolutely love. You can find anything you want on SHEIN they have literally tens of thousands of options and they make it easy to find exactly what you want. With the already low prices, they issue coupons up to 30% off every single week. If you’re concerned about quality- the product description below each item and reviews are very helpful. I’ve become a pro at ordering the best quality items for the best prices. Between coupons, earning 15 points for leaving reviews on itmes you’ve received, and other shoppers ‘liking’ your review (1 cent per like) it adds up. And from China to the US, the longest I’ve waited for a shipment is 12 days. Normally it comes in 1 week. You can also return items for free and have it refunded to either your SHEIN wallet and it will go toward your next purchase(2 days to receive refund) or back into your bank account (5-7 days to receive refund).

The prices are cheap, but the quality of their products is NOT cheap. 2. You can qualify for points and coupons to reduce your costs even though the prices are already low. 3. They have a LARGE variety of styles, and many of their styles are extremely unique. 4. They offer plus sizes for women who are heavier. 5. They offer the opportunity to get free clothes in exchange for an honest review. 6. I mentioned the ability to qualify for points. One fun way to do that is by getting creative. You have the opportunity to get creative by participating in an outfit contest. You choose SHEIN products and place them together on an image board. If you win the top “Editorial” pick, you can see your creation modeled by one of their gorgeous SHEIN models. 7. If you are an up-and-coming designer you have the opportunity to design clothing featured at SHEIN through their SHEIN X program. 8. You can get free shipping on all products if you join their SHEIN CLUB for a low quarterly cost. You also get discounts on the clothes you buy in addition to the discounts for non-members. 9. They offer a wide variety of payment options.

HOWEVER, how things have changed! Somehow they have really gotten their act together and are now a force to be reckoned with when it comes to clothes or even home decor. But it’s mainly the CLOTHES - I have probably ordered six or seven times just in the last three months, each order was big, and I have yet to be disappointed. I have almost redone my entire wardrobe with comfortable, affordable, cute clothes that fit really well. My only problem is that I find myself going to the app at least once a day because they get new stuff in constantly - I can’t keep up with it all. And the prices are so good that it’s hard not to buy stuff all the time. Shipping? My orders are normally at my door (in the Midwest) in under ten days from the order date - and in perfect condition, too. Everything is packed separately in its own little envelope, so nothing gets damaged. I used to think Shein was kind of a little under the radar sort of company, but no more.

I have been shopping for EVERYTHING I need through SHEIN for the last two years. I believe I purchase at least I order (at least) a month, if not more than one and especially since I noticed that they have both Afterpay and Klarna pay in 4 payments “programs”, that has made it even more wonderful. I LOVE their points system that allows you to gain points for various reasons (writing reviews or even just checking in once a day)…those points add up to money you can save on purchases you make.
