Let this app prioritize spoken word and bring back communication with people. Ban all media except for text, so this app stands out from, cough, its sister app, IG. And, um, Twitter. 

Also, please fix your UI for replies displaying strangely, stop sending me to Instagram to manage my settings on this app, and find a better way to integrate the experience of browsing someone‚Äôs profile on Threads and switching to their IG and vice-versa.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-06T18:56:06-07:00

This app is not perfect and they are adding new features every week so maybe it‚Äôll be perfect some day.

The process to transfer over from instagram into threads is seamless and easy. Would love to have a tab that lets you see posts from only people you‚Äôre following. My thread is full of posts from people I don‚Äôt follow and have no interest in following.

I so far am not impressed. Maybe it takes a while for everyone to catch on but it seems to me. It‚Äôs a rehash of the old Twitter now X app. There not much response to any posts and I can‚Äôt really figure out since we already have Instagram why this was put out by Meta.

Not a place for equality, all the onlyfans, porn, racism, child porn sharing and trash came straight from Twitter over here. If anything it‚Äôs worse than Twitter because reports are ignored. Porn is up for a week and still not taken down  

App needs to be 18+ nudity isn‚Äôt even blurred, it‚Äôs forced on you as you scroll. Age requirements should be 18+ up and stay that way. Drug content already posted. 
I don‚Äôt care what you people do in your private messages and groups but Threads is already being bombarded with this. 

Moderation needs to do something. Otherwise, everyone should know that Threads is the Wild West version of Instagram, you can at this time get away with whatever racist remarks or pornography your heart desires.
