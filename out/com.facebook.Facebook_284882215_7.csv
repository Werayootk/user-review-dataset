11101097521,whitebreadreviews,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1529816892,457.0.2,3,Facebook: an app,"Facebook is exactly as advertised, a way to connect with friends, family, and the internet as a whole. However there are a few complaints I have. First off, AI-image-powered content farming is rampant on this app, and nearly impossible to escape. There is no way to report these accounts because Facebook doesn’t see this as an issue, and if I say it’s spam, no action is actually taken and instead I am instructed to just block the account.
 Second, there are multiple fake accounts using my name and pictures who are not me, and I have tried to no avail to get these taken down. I am worried about this because these accounts are trying to trick my family and friends and that is unacceptable. 
Lastly, the UI is frankly quite confusing and irritating. I am constantly being sent unnecessary notifications and THEY DO NOT CLEAR I have to go in and delete each individual one.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T22:04:05-07:00
