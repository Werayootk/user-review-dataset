I also made some different alts for fun! <3 but pretty much in June of this year I got banned for being underage (but I also had two strikes) I’m still debating, though if it was the videos I made, they got me banned or in this case, which I’m talking about the community this person who was my classmate Basically I panicked for a little and I go onto one of those alts and say “my main account got banned, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah” and one of the worst things about saying that you got banned from TikTok on a video is the comments telling you scams.. but then I make a new account and it gets a good amount of followers and yayayayaya but then that gets banned but instead it says “ account blocked” so then naturally, I just used an alt that never got any followers and I just posted videos that go kinda viral but my main problem with the app it’s just a community isn’t always the best and TikTok doesn’t really do much about it.. thanks for reading this all the way if you did!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-13T06:55:30-07:00

Nothing that even breaks the guidelines from what I can tell, but still Tik Tok won’t let me promote it, sometimes they even slap that “are you sure you want to watch this video?” Button on my video when there’s NOTHING wrong with it. What’s worse is the “reason” they give for not being approved for the promote feature is the extremely vague “video breaks community guidelines” when previously in the beginning of promote feature i at least was told what guideline I broke. How am I supposed to know what’s wrong with the video so that I can fix it if I’m not even told what Guideline I broke? I WANT TO FIX the video so I can promote it, you as a company need to be SPECIFIC on what’s wrong with our videos when you disapprove the video or ban it.

But i think it would be nice if there was a bleeping tool. The bleeping tool would still have the original sound in the corner and all the videos using it but not if you add a bleep for your video. This way if someone sees the audio and likes it but doesn’t prefer bleeps they don’t have to add them or hunt the original down. I know a lot of people who don’t like to have curse words in their videos so they have to bleep them on a separate app and then re upload the audio. A lot of times people will do this repeatedly because almost all tiktok audios contain curse words. Whenever they do it repeatedly, it comes up as copy right and their account gets deleted due to violating community guidelines whenever they really were just trying to be able to use a audio they like without a curse word. If a bleep feature was included on tiktok it wouldn’t show up as copy right and you wouldn’t have to be afraid of your account getting deleted.

It’s not the best app for kids but over all a good app. On the downside, I wanted to go on the app to see what ppl where up to. I go on there and it said it starts on tiktok. I thought nothing of it and continue to look at the app when I go all the way in the app it changed my whole settings. I changed it 
to black settings and it went to white settings, etc. But the one thing that caught my eye is that all my drafts are gone. I think that it’s just the app been laggy so I log out and log back in. It still says that I have no drafts. So I’m like “oh like it’s fine it just laggy I just have to give it some time for it to work.” Time goes by and it still doesn’t show my drafts. So at this point I’m getting pumped up and I’m getting mad. I’ll give you some more time after a while I have my drafts back. Then the App was super duper laggy and I couldn’t even watch anything because it was so laggy. I still don’t know why it’s happening and I am trying to make a complaint. Overall on the downside this is a very good app and I definitely suggest you guys go get it. Just be careful on your drafts and it may be a lot laggy. Overall a perfect app for everyone",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-22T16:55:03-07:00

When it says “tapping too fast”, I could just be spamming an account or liking my friends videos, and then I won’t be able to like any more for like three hours. I think that TikTok should really put this into consideration because a lot of people that I know agree with me, and don’t get the point. Another thing that I think should be changed about TikTok is that you have to have 1,000 followers to go live. I think it should be less, but not like 100 or something because than almost all the people I follow would be going live constantly. If this were to happen, my notifications would be spammed all the time. And if it were to stay at 1,000, it might help people feel like they accomplished something. Although, people that don’t get attention don’t get on the for you page as much as popular creators. I think that this should change too, because everyone on TikTok deserves to get a chance. But if it were to change to this, I feel like people that make pointless videos would show up too much.

I do not use this app as much because I am so tired of their racist actions. I actually had a comment taken down once because it “violated community guidelines” when, in fact, it did not. I searched through their community guidelines for a reason as to why my comment got taken down, and even asked for an answer, which they never gave. My comment was in no way bad, as I was just calling out that how certain people responded to the video was inappropriate. I have been harassed on the app, and after reporting those comments was met with “the comments did not violate community guidelines.” Why should I support an app that encourages sexism, racism, and bullying? Older men post very inappropriate videos referencing sexual things in response to posts of CHILDREN. However, these posts are not “violating community guidelines” and remain up even after being reported numerous times. This app should be embarrassed.

1. You can’t go live without 1,000 or more followers. I think that’s not fair to those who are starting out and want to go live. For some, it’s VERY hard to keep even 100 followers. I think everyone should be allowed to go live, no matter their follow count. A requirement of 1,000 followers is too much. A requirement like that is silly. I wanted to go live the other day, and through research (because there was no information for me to find on the app) I found out I’m restricted from going live because of my follow count. Disappointing and infuriating. 
2. I’m almost never shown what I truly like. I’ve used this app for a while, mostly to gain inspiration for art projects. But when I get on the app and scroll past tons of posts Of things I don’t care about, I realize I maybe have seen 2% what I like and 98% of stuff I don’t.

This wasn’t really a big deal to me but kinda upset me a little, because I loved how people used to say kind things to your videos And like them. But I understand why they took it off because of rude people. 3) They took off the share button. On the little arrow button they took off the share option and you can only report it. I really wanted to send some funny ones to some friends of mine but never could I only got to use the video record which was annoying. 4) I don’t know if this is a glitch but.. i can’t find specific songs I want for my video.

All of those small moments in your life that you thought only happened to you, you would somehow find it on TikTok. Anything that’s food, animals, asmr, slime, houses, dances, etc. It will all be there on TikTok! TikTok has literally everything that you would be needing to search for. The only thing that I complain about sometimes here and there, is that I can’t change my age. My age is wrong and I only really realized it a couple weeks ago. I am 18 but I accidentally put my age 13..when I wanted to put the year, I scrolled down to what I thought said 18 but was 13, and then pressed submit. I don’t want to make a new account, because of my followers. I do truly hope that TikTok can do something about this. Because now since I am “13” my account is age restricted and I can’t change it back. It won’t let me press the button for “allow everyone to comment on your videos”. It only allows me to press “friends” or “no one” this is actually pretty frustrating. Please fix this, because I know a lot of other people on the app who share the same problem as me.

It’s content suppressing features are awful (shadowbanning, banning accounts / removing videos for seemingly no reason) to small accounts. PLUS they remove or make it impossible to find filters once they get popular, and they remove really helpful features all the time. Users used to be able to trim the audios to only use a certain part, but now you can’t. If an artist posts their song and it’s one minute long and you want to only use a 5-15 second part of it, well too bad, you can’t! The only way you can is by posting the audio yourself, so the original person doesn’t even get credit ://. Also, the newest updates “inbox” section is hard to use and just plain FUGLY. Why would you mix DMS and notifications?? It makes no sense. Also why do posts look like live streams without the caption and everything??

So if you accidentally juggle your phone a little bit you could find yourself posting a video you worked really hard on to your story where NOBODY will see it especially if you’re a small account and have ABSOLUTELY NO WAY of removing it from your story to post on your profile without deleting it entirely. And before you say “oh you can save it and post it the green screen way with the audio” no you can’t! Because for some reason the audio from the video DOES NOT SYNC with the audio From the original sound.

While pedophiles, racists, homophobes, etc. get to have massive platforms, there are young black activists getting de-platformed who don’t even curse much less do anything sinister or worth punishment. There is genuinely no reason for them to be banned yet they are.

On top of this, there are frequent platform-wide glitches where everyone’s views seem to drop to zero as well as their followers, following, likes, etc. After these glitches people will have followers removed and sometimes the information the algorithm uses for your fyp resets so people are forced to watch videos they don’t like or care about. Furthermore, the app as a whole is incredibly inaccessible. Video editing features are difficult to use. Sounds may not always work. The auto caption feature (which hasn’t even finished its roll out yet) isn’t even accurate and highlights blatant discrimination within the app by censoring words like “asian women” and critiques of white supremacy are consistently bastardized. For example, someone may say “we shouldn’t use eurocentric teaching in schools” and the captions will read “we should use afrocentric teaching in schools.”",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-22T21:22:51-07:00

To start off when you make an acc it asks you what your interested in. Everything you select will be on your fyp (for you page). If you want to follow people there’s also a following page, there you can see everyone you follows videos.

When you make an account you have the option to make it public or private. If you have it public ANYONE can see your vids. If you have it private people would have to request you to see your vids. You can also put your vids on friends only (people who follow you and you follow them back) or private (only visible to you). Also if you have a video you like but don’t want to post you can keep it in your drafts. 

I don’t recommend this app for kids 10 and under and here’s why. There is some inappropriate videos but you can simply click “not interested” and you won’t see videos like that anymore. There’s also cuss words but there’s some audios that the cuss words are blurred out. It’s a very fun app and I really recommend it.

example for blocking: theres this person in my life who ABSOLUTELY hates me and will do anything to get me in ""trouble"" (it never works) and hes made like 7 accounts to stalk me to find anything slightly ""bad"" ive done and ive blocked him and reported all of his accounts and only one got banned.
solution for my example: maybe make it so if someone is blocking you and youre making accounts, after you make like 2-3 accounts and follow that person that blocked you, it gets ""rid"" of that acciunt completley for that person's accounts. but this only will work if tiktok knows if youre ""dragonmaster1234"" (that name was an example) and you make another account 
example for reports: i have this other friend who hates me (people dont like me i know) and she like stole stuff from me and spread fake stuff about me so i reported her and tiktok did nothing.
solution to that example: look further into reports. thats all i have to say.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-10T18:18:00-07:00

Favorites is now the only real way I can save sounds, which can get annoying because it takes too long to scroll through my saved sounds. Privates aren’t really helpful anymore, they’re stuck between public videos and you can easily forget they’re even there. Videos are still able to be featured, but I can’t ever see featured videos because the featured stream was replaced with the for you stream. My follower stream is never in order and has videos that were posted weeks ago vs videos posted recently. Everyone’s likes went down significantly once the update took place. Why were BFF’s taken away? Those helped people reward active followers without having to follow them back. There’s also a setting that stops you after liking a certain amount of videos and tells you to take a break. No other social media app has this, so the only thing you’re really doing is making it easier for someone to switch apps or even delete this one.

I have (had) hundreds of privates with memories and just fun-to-do videos made. I updated the app today and my privates have turned into 'drafts' which basically means I can't reuse sounds I have previously used before the recent update. Meaning all of my privates (ranging in at least the hundreds) are simply videos that I can't reuse or even save to my camera roll without posting the video publicly (which I refuse to since they are personal videos not meant for others to see) when trying to solve the problem with my privates the videos I watch to decide if I delete them or not end up being duplicated to the top so now I have twice as many privates. It's a struggle and I'm genuinely hurt because everything I've done on the app for probably 2-3 years have turned into trash. I can't delete the app because I can't save the valued videos without posting it so I refuse to open the app until I can have my previous sounds back. It would be good if musically took feedback from ALL their users instead of their favorited users since they're probably happy unlike the 90 percent of users.

2 people can have the EXACT same post. One person get a community violation and the other persons video goes viral. There is no way to contact anyone in support and if you somehow get through no one ever gets back to you. 
Then I used to have this awesome editor. Could add captions, had the ability to set the timing of the text on screen, and the music. One day it all goes away and have an archaic editor. Cannot add captions and no way to add text on screen. When I contacted support I was told the new editor was rolling out in stages. But I already had the new editor, they took it away. 
The fact that there are people that can heat your posts and that there is something other than the algorithm that determines if you do well or not. So if you get on their bad side or get flagged for anything they limit your reach. 
Since I can’t edit in the app I now use INSTAGRAM which is so much better and just repurpose to TT. If they want you to edit in the TT app they should have a decent editor.

A company should train all employees to follow the exact same guidelines for all creators. One video along with hundreds of “duets” and “stitches” can exist but I can upload the EXACT same thing (duet/stitch) and get flagged. Lately I’ve even had videos flagged with no option for an appeal. Not even a specific reason is given for the video being flagged. Just “violates standards” and nothing further. The bullying by kids and adults alike is concerning. People leave awful things in the comments and reporting them comes back saying they didn’t violate standards.  We can’t video reply to defend ourselves without being flagged for bullying.  Meanwhile you have big creators getting verified whose content is based solely on insulting and doxxing other creators. True crime creators give graphic details of crimes yet people can’t talk about their personal trauma without being silenced. They cherry pick who gets “punished” and Who doesn’t. The larger creators can post whatever they want with no repercussions and get paid for it. You can’t even get a nonstandard reply from the support team when entering a ticket. It’s just a generic response that doesn’t even fit the topic.

It’s by far my favorite app and i use it constantly, although maybe too much but i see that as not a negative. It’s the only app that really promotes such a wide array of content and really tailors content to you. The only drawback I would say is the fact that sometimes it is really hard to have your content put out to other people, as the algorithm seems to be spotty in its ability to recognize content and promote it to a wider audience. This leads to many videos not reaching the amount of people you had hoped for and there is no real way to get it promoted. But this issue is not a big one, as from time to time my content seems to reach a wider audience, and so is the nature of life, you win some you loose some. This app has really benefited so many people as I can see, ranging from influencers to small businesses, and lets people reach a wide audience that many other social media apps do not.

I just wish that bullies would be taken more seriously on this app. I’ve reported a few comments not just on my own videos but on others as well that are flat out rude and could seriously cause someone in the wrong mind set to hurt themselves. Only to turn around and have nothing be done about the comments or the person posting them. Also I’ve noticed ALOT of children who are way under the suggested age on this app. I think security for this app needs to be upped and made sure that these young kids aren’t on here. There’s a lot of mature adult content that other creatures are posting and kids shouldn’t be seeing or hearing some of these audios. My final thought on this app is that the creators need to fix the comments!! Instead of just mixing all the comments up on videos, should have an algorithm like Facebook has where the comments are in order! Tired of having to dig through hundreds of comments to see what one person recently posted on my videos, only to not be able to find it or it’s at the very bottom or mixed in the middle. 
Over all easy to use app, lots of amazing creators, cosplayers and people that I have come across on this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-08T13:49:05-07:00
9909953323,Arianna b.G,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1077090964,29.3.0,5,TikTok review,"What is TikTok?

TikTok is a really enjoyable app to millions of people. It has become one of the most popular apps out there, and more than 2 million videos from users all around the world are uploaded daily. On TikTok you are able to communicate with friends, upload a video of your own, and watch other users videos as well. On TikTok something that is commonly used is known as “filters.” Filters are some thing you may use to have fun, boost your confidence, or to even just put a smile on your face. Some of the filters have games and some don’t, you can use whichever you want! If you make a video and you don’t want anybody to see you can put it as “private” and only you are able to see the video. If you made a video and you don’t want to upload it, but you don’t want to delete it, you can put it in your “drafts” it will hold all the videos that you don’t want to upload. TikTok has lots more things that I would love to share with you, but as of right know that’s all the important information I have for you today. Bye!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-09T12:33:54-07:00

It uses information such as watch time, further exploration, outside of app use, and FACIAL EXPRESSIONS to determine what videos to feed you to make you the happiest. Yes, that is correct, they use your camera to see how you react to certain videos. You clicked accept🤷‍♂️. Spending time on this app is spending DAYS of your life which you will never get back. You won't learn as much in school, you won't get to know people as well, you are missing so much by wasting your life on this app and most people can't recognize that. Furthermore, tiktoks algorithm for people in America is meant to display delinquent behavior, stuff that spreads stupidity, and information which is largely false. IT IS A CHINESE COMPANY. They are sucessfully invading the US without even touching our boarders. Most of you people are too stupid that warfare isn't just man-to-man combat anymore, its all cyberattacks and large scale infrastructure hacking. They have made such a large portion of the young US population zombia and honest unbreedable. I would never marry someone who is addicted to tiktok. I will hand it to ByteDance, they have created an algorithm which is yet to be beat, but YOU PEOPLE NEED TO GET OFF THIS APP",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-13T22:59:37-07:00

Listen I love tiktok, but just bring back the regular being able to pause slideshows, not going back and forth between the weird screen format change and muting the audio. It is not just me who shares this sentiment. I have seen many, many people complain about it and talk about how they just want the regular pausing feature permanently like I do. There is NO ONE who has said that they like or prefer the newer slideshow function better than the original. If it’s so necessary for tiktok to have this ugly newer slideshow function applied to users then at least give tiktok users the option to switch between the two slideshow features. ALSO, please bring back the friends tab, I am not saying to delete the discover page since there are people who like that but please add the friends page back somehow, I would like to be able to see my mutuals videos and stories and not have them be buried in my following page and filtered out by the stupid algorithm. There are plenty of other things to address here but I’m going to leave it at that.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-31T21:15:07-07:00

9812383214,ioscope,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1301682242,28.9.1,1,I’m so frustrated with this app,"I like this app when it comes to finding and consuming media, but making content is a PAIN, and my account is so heavily restricted because of my age. 
Sometimes I make videos over one minute WITH AUDIO OVER ONE MINUTE. If I save it to drafts, the audio deletes itself saying “This audio doesn’t support videos over one minute long,” DESPITE THE AUDIO BEING OVER A MINUTE LONG. Filming videos with multiple clips is torture so I have to use a different app to edit. 
I love cosplaying but have a hard time making friends, but theoretically with TikTok I can make friends around my age who like cosplay as well. But my account has limited reach because of my age, other people can’t duet/stitch my videos, my videos only reach like 5 people, and I can’t DM my friends. It’s so frustrating how I put lots of effort into my cosplays and barely anyone sees them. It’s frustrating how I can’t talk to my friends on this app even though there’s plenty of other apps that allows people YOUNGER than me to DM people. 
I just want to show people my silly costumes, talk to my silly moots, and be myself on this app, but I can’t do that because of the restrictions put on my account. Editing on this app is painful, and putting so much effort on a video only for that effort to go to waste is pain.

You click “clear mode” and it makes the “clear mode button disappear and brings up the menu for “playback speed” and “not interested”

I have a fairly large following on the app and love that the age limit is 13+ (for those of you leaving bad reviews because you’re younger, read the TOS) but hate that when I report VERY young kids having their own account sometimes it’ll come back “no violations found”. I’m talking 6yr olds just out here posting all their personal information. Also, there’s a HUGE issue with child exploitation on the app. I came across a live of a “father” bathing his 5yr old daughter once! Like fully showing everything! I reported it immediately and yet the report remained “under review” for months and nothing has ever been done about it. There are lots of parents & foster parents, or even older siblings, that include small children in their thirst trap videos! Why is this ok?! Lastly, please allow us adults to set our accounts to 18+ only. Not because there is nudity or whatever, but because honestly I just don’t like kids interacting with my posts. I’d prefer to have my videos set to an adult crowd only thanks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-01T19:44:49-07:00
8174861039,puppy's #1 fan,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id558266262,22.5.0,3,Great but needs work,"I absolutely love TikTok, this app has helped me laugh, learn, and so much more, however I do have an issue with the new privacy standards. TikTok randomly asked me for me to clarify my age, which I didn’t mind doing because I had previously done it. But after I did lots of things on my account changed. My account was getting some fame and I was gaining followers and even managed to get around 15k followers. However once I clarified my age (which I put my real age) nobody could comment, stitch, save, or duet my videos. And with the account I had those things were very important. TikTok has made it almost impossible to make any progression with my account and has given me zero motivation to keep posting. I just wish they would change the privacy settings back to the way they used to be. I understand that they want to make sure kids don’t do stupid things and are protected, however I don’t think this was the right way to do it. I should be able to put my privacy settings the way I want for my own safety and not have the app tell me what me and my followers can and cannot do. I will change the rating to five stars if this issue is resolved.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-27T10:09:32-07:00

Tiktok is a great app in all aspects of life, dont get me wrong.. we can be creative, we can vent, we can use other sounds to help express how we are feeling or just to get another laugh! This is a great app for me because it helps with my anxiety and depression everyday. It helps keep me calm and is one of my coping skills to get out of this mental institution/ rehabilitation center. Its not easy being wwhere im at. I just want to go home, but the thing i have bugging me right now about this app is that it wont show yhe correct ammount of followers that i have. I have gained over five followers within the pat week and i was at 198 followers and now it says 201 followers? Thats only three followers. I should have 203 followers. Please fix this to get a better rating in the future
Also personally, i feel that everyone shout get to be able to go live on tiktok, mno matter the amount of followers. 1000 minimum? Are you serious? Some if us Arent able
To come up with creative content everyday! Im in a lockdown nursing home mental institution

8065331075,n1yaZzzZzz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id879927779,22.0.0,1,I am very disappointed with tiktok.,"Tiktok used to be a very amusing app to me. I would enjoy spending my time following my other friends, making videos, and viewing other peoples videos. The thing that really ruined my view about tiktok is when they banned my account. I was absolutely disappointed, for a fact that I did nothing to get banned, also that the app didn’t alert me what I had done to get banned. I’m not the type to comment rude comments on other pages nor have I ever done that. I just got banned today, so in fact I’m guessing it’s something I did recently but I still have no clue. I have gotten one warning on tiktok which was for my profile picture, but I immediately removed my profile picture. I thought you would at least get 2 warnings before getting banned, however i got only one. In conclusion, i don’t have any clue of what i have done to get banned on tiktok and I am extremely disappointed in this app. After all the disrespectful, racist, homophobic, fat phobic, transphobic etc. comments I’ve seen people comment on this app, and I have choose to ignore those comments and be the better person, their account never got banned. Tiktok at least tell me what I got banned for and maybe that will uplift my thoughts on this app, but for now I am just so tired of this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-26T06:37:53-07:00
