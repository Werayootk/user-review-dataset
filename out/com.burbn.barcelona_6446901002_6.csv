However, this is just another Twitter with the same bozos from all sides screeching nonstop about the same topics as they do on Twitter to the mental benefit of absolutely no one except for said bozos sadly low self-esteem. And the fact that you can’t hide the constant pushing of Threads in IG is also a turnoff.  The whole premise of Threads was a less toxic Twitter, I call that unequivocally false.  Just the same echo chambers of vitriolic clowns spewing the same crazy rhetoric.

1. Direct messaging - being able to share threads directly to someone’s inbox and chat back and forth. We all love getting those relatable reels from our friends every day, so why not do the same with threads?

2. Multiple accounts - to truly unify this as a Meta app, being able to log into multiple accounts and switch between them easily is a huge help for independent creators/business owners that need to share content between several different accounts.

If these features are added, consider me a definite user!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-06T20:46:11-07:00
