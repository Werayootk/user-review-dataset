You’re out of luck the second that free trial expires, of course. You go back to playing against people with a 100+ level advantage, who are making those highly improbable shots and taking back all of that sweet, sweet elite coin. 
*Of course being an elite member doesn’t mean you’re going to win every match, nor does being a regular player mean you’re going to lose every match.

All six pockets make up between 7-9% of the table surface, yet the cue ball finds the center on a regular basis - including clipping off the corner of one pocket and rolling straight to another.
