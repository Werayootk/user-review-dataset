Very straight forward app layout an very easy to navigate. Another great feature about this app is when I enter the tracking number it knows the store the order was purchased from and saves them for you so if you want to shop them stores again you can by the press of a button. All in all it‚Äôs a great app for someone that orders off the internet and the packages have the option to be tracked it can all be done in one place an that‚Äôs this app. üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüòé,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-03T12:07:42-07:00

Of course, it linked all of my incoming orders from other places which in theory sounds amazing! However, if you order more than 2 things max good luck trying to figure out which tracking number belongs to which order. My 2 biggest complaints with this app are as follows:
1. Only lists the tracking number, no other corresponding information about which package it is so I have to go to the original shop just to figure out what they are
2. The tracking is out of date. As of current it shows I have 4 packages; 1 delivered and 3 of which are in transit. This is annoying considering I should only have 2 so now I have to dig through all the orders to figure out which ones are accurate and relevant to me.

For the future (and I know in your FAQ you mention adding other mail providers) but I would like to be able to add multiple gmail accounts to search for shipments through. For example I have a primary and secondary gmail account and I buy products through each.

But this could be the problem of the initial company who just hasn‚Äôt been able to fill orders so there is nothing to track - the reason I actually deleted the app was that I poked around to ses the information related to OTHER orders that had already been filled or I already was aware of their progress.

The piece that seemed to work seamlessly was the interaction with other sites to buy products.

Perhaps by playing around and linking more information into this system things would get more accurate - however it‚Äôs difficult for me to justify investing that time when most companies are forthright about shipping delays (in the event you don‚Äôt have a tracking number) and entering a tracking number through USPS / FedEX / UPS is simple and straightforward and provides all the info you need.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-25T01:41:26-07:00
