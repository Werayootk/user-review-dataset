Positives: I enjoy the visual tracking showing geographic locations of my purchases (They seem to be delayed due to delayed carrier updates and I‚Äôm sure COVID exasterbated the supply chain issues -not fault of the shop app). Great feature, you may be surprised by the route your items ship.

This is really frustrating, because I was wanting to log all my confirmed online purchases, regardless of their shipping status.

Previous review:

The designers need to take a page from Material Design or something. The interface is way too flat and busy, and it‚Äôs hard to tell separation of different orders. It‚Äôs also hard to find the information I need from a single order since it is often hidden behind more drilldown menus or in a place that is not immediately obvious. A big reason for the confusing layout is the lack of depth on orders and information blocks, it‚Äôs hard to tell where one ends and the next one starts. Different kinds of orders have completely different layouts as well (Shop Pay orders vs. simple tracking numbers), adding to the confusion.

Also the tracking data is consistently out of date. I always have to click through to the tracker website to get the real time data.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-20T17:11:25-07:00
