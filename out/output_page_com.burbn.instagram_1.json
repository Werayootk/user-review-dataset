First it was the removal of chronological feed, and, as of recent, the removal of the recent posts option under hashtags. While yes, you can filter it through recent top posts, it still only shows the top ones. This makes it much more difficult for smaller creators to branch out and build and audience, and I’ve also heard that people are getting shadowbanned for apparently no reason, but this is something I can’t verify. Basically, long story short, it’s nearly impossible for small creators to grow and get views the way they used to because their art is blocked by the top posts. There’s nothing wrong with having a top posts option, but instagram should bring back the ability to filter through recent posts, regardless of the amount of attention and engagement they’ve received. Every update it seems to get worse. It doesn’t affect my enjoyment of the app overall, but this is something that should change if they intend for this to be a platform where smaller creators have the chance to grow alongside other ones, and it’s something that is significantly impacting a large portion of their user base.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-24T01:19:30-07:00"},{"id":"8428538233","userName":"koolkool007.xl","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id899317333","version":"224.1","score":1,"title":"no help or support","text":"I have had troubles with the music feature on instagram for MONTHS now.

From my understanding I think it may be the quality of the audio recording. After making this hypothesis, I converted my audio recording to higher quality formats, which included flac and wav files.

The platform, which used to showcase high-quality photography, now promotes meaningless content that is more focused on vanity and self-promotion than anything else. The platform has lost touch with its roots and no longer values the art of photography. Instead, Instagram has shifted its focus to more superficial trends, such as filters and gimmicks, which have little to do with actual photography. It seems that Instagram is more concerned with monetizing its platform than celebrating the creators who helped make it popular in the first place. It is also disappointing to see that Instagram has taken to smearing other platforms, such as TikTok, in a desperate attempt to remain relevant. Instead of focusing on creating a platform that values its creators, Instagram is wasting its money and resources on trying to discredit its competitors. It's time for Instagram to wake up and start appreciating its users and the value they bring to the platform. Instead of focusing on advertising and gimmicks, Instagram should be investing in the creators who helped build the platform's success. By doing so, Instagram can become the leader in the industry once again and regain the respect of photographers worldwide.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-26T14:02:12-07:00"},{"id":"10126654374","userName":"Maria Bilen","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1547561221","version":"290.0","score":4,"title":"I really want to change my chat theme + I want to add music to my notes","text":"I’ve been having instagram since 2017 from where I met a lot of people and had a good experience of how to use the app to communicate with others even though I’ve been creating new accounts.

But a distinct issue with instagram is that some updates will just.. make everything wonky or sort of make the app lose its appeal. Even though reels are just straight up an accessible tiktok on the app, I don’t mind them. However, I’m extremely baffled with the recent update that changed the format of instagram videos. It’s like an IGTV/REEL format instead and it makes it very hard to save videos to folders- which in my opinion is one of instagrams BIGGEST appeals. Unlike other social media apps you can very easily sort posts into folders for later references. Making this feature that much more difficult to access is especially annoying when you are a part of the editing community in instagram where you’ll want to save certain edits to certain folders or save audios to an audio folder. If I’m scrolling through my feed it’s fine, but it’s very tedious to save a video if it’s something my friend sent me since I have to go into my account saves and manually move it.

Sharing your own pictures, and sharing friends or mutual’s work too. The newest update makes the latter impossible and tedious. Instead of being able to simply tap the airplane icon next to a post, and then posting it to your story, you have to back out of it, go to your story, set up a new “create” post, and add a reshare sticker. This makes resharing on the fly incredibly annoying. It slows the spread of posts, and is basically discouraging people from sharing others work in the first place. This is detrimental to communities like activists, artists (who you don’t seem to care much about anyways), content creators, and more. You are effective killing the main source communication and collaboration within your app. Whether you think videos are the hit new thing or not, you ARE NOT TIKTOK. Stay in your lane, or you’ll lose every loyal user. If you’re trying to be something completely new, then make a new app, and leave Insta alone! Nobody comes to Instagram expecting TikTok like content, and that will never change no matter how hard you push that type of content. If you actually care about the stability of your user base, and the Insta community as a whole, please return the old resharing.

Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts.

Between me and the people I know who also use Instagram for iPhone, im the only one who doesn’t have the “settings>account>posts you’ve liked” setting anymore. And I was willing to let go viewing liked pictures because I found out that reels had an option to view liked reels, even if it was buggy. But now, neither option exists so liking pictures or reels is pointless. I basically have no reason to come back to this app because I can’t even go back and look at the art or tutorials I’ve liked/might want to use as a reference. \n\nI’ve also tried to contact whatever nonexistent customer service there is with no answer back whatsoever. Seriously, if you Google their customer service contact list, the only option is to report an issue through Instagram. There is no email, phone number, nothing actually useful that lets you know that your complaints or questions will be seen by a human being. Heaven forbid something good ever comes back to this app, such as the fixing of the broken algorithm that makes you view the same posts for weeks at a time. I’ve had to unfollow so many people because it was the only method to fixing the issue.

I do. It’s a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it’s basically a second explore page and so you don’t see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.\n\nInstagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of “hinderances” might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I’m sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don’t. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-11-17T10:45:44-07:00"},{"id":"2908612466","userName":"andrew_colin_","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id512968344","version":"53.0","score":4,"title":"Maintenance","text":"I have had a frustrating issue for several months now where certain features either make the app crash suddenly, or do not work entirely. One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I’ve tried with just 2 photos. I’ve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I’ve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I’d neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I’ll see posts I’ve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order??

The email and number are from my experience never used, which makes both ways to contact them pointless. But another thing is is the biometric identification bot, is an obstacle to pass. I recently have been trying to access my account and it’s been a nightmare. So likewise I’ve been searching and watching online videos and reading sources on how to pass the “obstacle”. I feel like human review should be put to use more simply because it’s hard for an ai to understand something less perplexed. I think the ai  wants you to be perfect which is going to be hard for a lot of people. Currently writing this review I have not gotten fully into my account due to the 2fa which is the start of the problem, but hopefully I can get back into my account this week.  In conclusion, the app is great but there are some things that needs to be worked on and changed. For example the identification verification bot and a little more but that’s all.

I’m extremely disappointed. I don’t need to see posts like this and neither do 13 year olds who use this app. Most of the time, it’s meme/funny pages that are associated with these posts, but it’s not actually them because they’re tagged in it somehow so I can see it. So no matter how many pages I block, another one will pop up just because I want to see quotes! I can’t go through 5 posts on my page without seeing these things. Instagram, PLEASE take this feature away. PLEASE save everyone from seeing these awful posts. At the least, PLEASE give me a response to my reports.

For a while the updates were improving the experience especially as instagram grew in popularity. Probably in the last year I’ve grown to really hate instagram. It’s following the trend of all other social media sites, It’s 75% ads, and if you respond to ads saying they aren’t relevant or you don’t like them or whatever it doesn’t make a difference. For example I get a lot of alcohol adds, probably because I'm in my 20s, I’ve asked to stop seeing them a million times and I still see them daily. The algorithm is awful. My following feed is always in a weird order, I don’t see so many of my friends posts, and after every 2 posts it’s an add or a suggested account or suggested content. Doesn’t make sense. The popular page or for you page, idk what it’s called, is terrible. I was pregnant almost 2 years ago and my entire recommended feed is pregnancy related. But the worst feature by far is the reels. I despise the reels. It’s trying to be TikTok but it’s not. And it’s really just reposted TikTok’s or content that’s pretty unpleasant in my opinion. If I wanted to watch TikToks I wouldn’t have deleted TikTok. The app is a mess. It’s not fun, and I can’t stand scrolling for more than a few minutes. Also the amount of spam accounts in my Dms is ridiculous. I get tagged in spam posts daily.

I’m writing this review because my account has been wrongfully shadow-banned and action blocked over 6 times now without an actual just cause for it. Every time, it says I was allegedly “sharing my account with a service that helps me get more likes and followers” even though that’s blatantly untrue. I have 0 posts, 0 likes and well under 1000 followers. I have written 4 detailed reports explaining my situation but it has been to no avail. Every time this happens, I’m forced to change my password, I’m logged out of my account and then I’m action blocked for an entire week. Every time I try to like or comment, it gives me the option to report it if I believe they have made a mistake but nothing works. My account is never checked, my week long action blocks are never reduced or lifted, my reports are never acknowledged and I’m always getting wronged.

Not everyone wants to be a business and pay for followers and promotions. IG was already making enough with ad revenue. But killing the organic feed was about the most blatant sign of greed i’ve seen from a social media platform. We expected it from Facebook, and naturally everyone saw it coming with the merger. Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place. Remember what happened to Tumblr? The first IG? Yea its going in that direction. The censorship and bias towards trending profiles alone is going to kill this platform just like Facebook is suffering from.
