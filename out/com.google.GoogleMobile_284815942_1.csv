I had to say the entire process was slower than I thought. I figured I’d be back to full activities in a month. They ensured me it was a process. I was confused as to why they were working  on parts other than my lower back. Hamstring, quads. Calves,.glutes. They explained that the back pain is connected other areas. While working on the back they give you the tools going forward with hopes of preventing reoccurrence. You also have to do the homework as part of the process but it works. I’m thankful to not have been back for treatment.  Thank you keep up the good work!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T10:49:32-07:00
