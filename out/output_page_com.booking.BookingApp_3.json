Everything has been renovated to the highest caliber. The beds are all three like sleeping on clouds. \nAlthough, we were here only one night, prior to a flight to Newfoundland, we could have all spent a week. The restaurants in the area are great & so reasonably priced. We ate at Di‚ÄôParma, 2 blocks away. Fantastic fresh swordfish & risotto.

The initial booking travel was mostly easy. However, every issue or communication after that was a nightmare. \nIt took several attempts to address/resolve any concerns or inquiries about our upcoming trip. A lot of back n forth (most of it me sending multiple messages to get a real response-not automated) with minimal answers, that which took several days to finally get a conclusion/resolution. \nTwo times we were even charged for things that we still have not received a reason or reimbursement for, even after multiple inquiries thru messages within app and emails.\nFirst one, upon booking we were charged more than the agreed (and authorized) amount. Booking denied the additional amount charged, but my bank statement reflected otherwise. \nSecond one, came after our trip. No emails or messages, but a charge to my bank account (even tho I had previously removed it from the app due to the previous charge issue). No one could give us a reason, and when I requested a refund since there was no reason, the lines of communication stopped each time we‚Äôd reach that point.

I had the receipt, flight times‚Ä¶etc. Booking messed up. 2nd - they will not refund me for a rental car that was not picked up. We arrived late due to flight delays. Car company at the airport closed at 11:00pm. We arrived after 11:00pm. Nowhere was this made known to me and booking thought that I could just call while I was in the air. Had to rent from a different company and Booking will not refund me for the first rental when nobody from the rental company was even at the airport.

Because of some technicality even though I had called in advanced to let them know we were running late. This is something they could work on is the communication so people aren‚Äôt left stranded with nowhere to sleep! Next night I booked online but this time I payed online to make sure We had a place to sleep after a long day of driving. I call the hotel to confirm and they said I had to pay in the establishment, but I told them I had already payed ? So I ended calling customer service and they helped me thru the process! Only reason for 4 stars is because of the customer service representatives!!!

Great apartment","text":"I wish I could leave a ten start review! \nWe arrived late after a long trip from Corfu. The hosts were waiting for us at the apartment and showed us around. The apartment was spotless clean, the fridge was stocked with water, fruits and orange juice for the kids. They didn‚Äôt just recommend an amazing place for dinner but also showed us the way to it. Really the kindest hosts who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I was truly impressed and touched by their kindness! The apartment is also tastefully decorated with handmade furniture by the hostess. The location is perfect - just 200 meters away from Kalamitsa beach. We will definitely be back next time we travel to Greece!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-29T09:44:45-07:00"},{"id":"8637779063","userName":"Natebetrucking","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1213137097","version":"33.0.1","score":1,"title":"Do not use booking","text":"Been using booking for 3 years as a trucker it‚Äôs very convenient too see the selection of everything In your area well I booked a hotel on my home stay was charged double yeah twice after speaking with bank too confirm which it was follow by the hotel I then called booking who then informed me as long as I provided pictures and statements that it would be refunded which I did just for them too then tell me that they seen the charge but then say they don‚Äôt do any charges that I would have too wait for the hotel too post the charge which I spoke with the hotel because I‚Äôm very good friends with this hotel I stay on a regular every month which I was informed that any charges was through booking needless too say my bank has filed fraudulent statements and the hotel has sent proof too my bank so I can get refunded in the morning so thanks too booking for not caring about wrongfully taking people money","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-04T16:18:41-07:00"},{"id":"2186304113","userName":"GumpDrvr","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id136371885","version":"16.1","score":2,"title":"Muscat Hills Resorts","text":"Day 1: Upon arrival we were not even welcomed at the gate. Security was very rude even though we arrived in an airport taxi. There was not even a hotel buggy to take us to our quarters. Dinner that evening was great we had a wonderful hostess from Myanmar and in my opinion absolutely professional beyond measure. \n\nDay 2 : The beaches and the breakfast were wonderful. The views were simply and breathtaking. Dinner that nights was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The hostesses were very pushy in trying to get us to place our order.  Then after that didn‚Äôt work they ignored us until we had to signal them to come over. The kicker out of the whole night was their manager Ricardo. Me and my wife watched him greet every other table and guest that night twice while only glancing at us. I guess we had to either be Arab or Caucasian for him to even greet us in his Resturant. Horrible experience never would I recommend this resort to anyone.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-02-09T03:23:44-07:00"},{"id":"1814878993","userName":"Solo Vagabond","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id535822289","version":"15.2","score":2,"title":"Less than expected","text":"Location proximity to Oktoberfest was only good thing. Well the check-in staff were friendly enough. The place was dark and grungy with several lights out. My first room was okay, but missing furniture.\nThere were not adequate outlets either. I had to change rooms for my two night stay. This made me quite upset, as I was traveling for business and it meant leaving everything in luggage storage all the time. The luggage storage did not seem secure as it was in in an outside building and not monitored. It was also a ransacked mess. The breakfast, that I thought was included, was not. It was an okay assortment, but the breads did not seem fresh.\nMy second room was worse than the first. But at least it had all furniture. The bed was about the least comfortable I've been on in a while. All night long people were knocking on doors and making loud noises. Broken beer bottles in the hallway. It was just a mess.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-09-28T06:15:27-07:00"},{"id":"10471948975","userName":"Tim AZ.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id891108571","version":"41.3.2","score":1,"title":"Marriott - front desk Claimed never received reservation","text":"Marriott louisville east claimed to not receive my reservation. I arrived at ~10pm family vacation driving all day. They say nkt in system it happens all the time with all 3rd party sites and sometimes gets booked under other names etc. turned us away  to find another room late night‚Ä¶meanwhile i try to contact booking both phone calls which said technical glitch and disconnected and through chat which says will be responded to within ‚Äú24 hrs‚Äù. Which i never got a response. I emailed and tried to chat 2 more times no response. I then get a charge from marriott from that site. Not happy with booking their inability to provide customer service as they say they do ‚Äú24 hrs a day‚Äù made a nightmare of a night for my family. I understand Marriott's part as well and will be contacting them also. The 1 star is for terrible actually ZERO support for me. Very unhappy. .
