Gone are the days of high foreign currency exchange rates or running out of cash in a foreign country. I’ve just made a transcontinental move and having this app has made life so much easier by allowing me to hold different currencies and somehow just knowing which currency to deduct when I’m in each country (ie. I was originally worried it would use AUD when I was in the States but this isn’t happened).

In my case, the sender initiated this transaction (gift) 2 weeks (!) ago and still there is no sign of it. Money was collected from sender`s account, but I have never received the notification about the gift to accept.

Revolute help had no idea how to handle. I simply asked them to resend the notification -which as mentioned I have never received- to be able to accept the gift OR send the money back to the sender.

I use none of the services, I haven’t been converting money or honestly using the card much at all since March. 

They sent it to their “team” for review. It has been hugely inconvenient. I can’t begin to understand why it would take so long - I don’t have that many transactions to begin with.

Although this company seen that after this company cancelled my flight 2 days before leaving Bogota I had to pay for a last minute ticket paying double of what I already paid before. 

Please stay away!!! What is the purpose of paying for fees when you receive mediocre customer service. No one that deal with real time issue and everyone pass the blame on everyone. 

Now this is my last straw with this company and I know I am the fool with this one. But I will be closing this account asap. Recently I order some grocery on a platform.
