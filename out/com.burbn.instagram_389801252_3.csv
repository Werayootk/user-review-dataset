I‚Äôm so disappointed and angry with their constantly bothering me. Nobody emails me or messages me or gives me any explanation and my other account works fine. Might just have to start using Facebook again instead because Instagram is getting worse every single day.

The food was excellent and the presentation was excellent.  They must have the best chef in town as I have never seen anything in the Duluth area presented anywhere near what we were served.  The waitress was very good but no name tags?  Management too cheap?  How do I request a table next time with the same server?
Now the downside.  The bar area was nice and cool on a hot day, BUT the dining area facing the Lake where everyone ate was WARM and uncomfortable.  I asked if they could do anything about it and the gal in the bar area agreed that it was warm and said she would ask.  Ask?  She has to ASK when it is obviously uncomfortable?  The thermostat was on an inside corner of the dining area.
I also noticed that the whole Fitgers shopping area on the street level was warm!  They must not be able to afford air conditioning?  Not sure I would want to shop there.
Parking was on the street.  Because the Boat House is understaffed and service is very slow I had to go back and put another hour on the meter and that was barely enough.

I never see my friends on my feed anymore unless I am scrolling for 10 minutes and people‚Äôs pictures are not getting as many likes. I can speak from experience because I have watched my likes go down as Instagram has changed their algorithm. People like things which are unique! Keep Instagram different and unique and make other platforms want to be like you, not you wanting to be like them. If the changes are based off of Statistics, realize the functions of other apps. Snapchat for instance, people like it simply because it is very private. On Instagram you are able to send pictures to people however they can be uploaded from the camera roll and used to look like the picture was taken just then.. this makes Instagram very user friendly for catfishes. Just keep the traditional Instagram aspects and forget about conformity. Make it so dm pictures- if uploaded from camera roll, it states that. Additionally, make the feed tendered to followers which a users look at most frequently.

I want to be able to post all of them into one post and have all of the pictures be the original size. This would be great for photographers like me who go out on photoshoots and want to put up one post with their best photos. It is hard to do that when all of your photos are cropped the exact same way. It should be the same way as Facebook. I am not saying we make Instagram exactly like Facebook because they are two different social medias, but I think it would be nice if we could upload photos on Instagram the same way we can upload them on Facebook. With Facebook you have one post with multiple pictures that are all the original sizes. You can then click on them and look through them individually before exiting and going through the rest of your feed. Instagram should allow us to have the option to upload our photos like this.

High engagement is difficult to come by and it seems as though the creators of Instagram are working their hardest to make this app the hardest to work with. Now that creating reels are what you need in order to be seen on this app, it would seem as though the app works against its users as making reels has become glitchy and difficult. Whenever I upload my own videos from my camera roll to the app, the videos visibly glitch or shake even when they don‚Äôt do that in my camera roll or in the reels preview. Additionally, when I have texts or captions timed perfectly on my reel while creating it, after I post it the texts all collide and overlap each other and all of my texts that I spent time on precisely timing are all unreadable.

I had 600 hundred followers and was averaging 100 followers gained a day. The first thing they did to my account was make it unable to comment but that was understandable I guess because I was commenting a lot. They then lifted this after one day. I started posting again and realized my hashtags didn‚Äôt work because now they shadow banned me because (and I‚Äôm guessing) they believed my account was a bot. This got me mad but my account was still thriving so I did not care. They than started deleting some of my post claiming it went against their guidelines which I read later on and saw that it didn‚Äôt.i also made a promotion with one of my vids and had no problems and the next time I tried doing it with the same vid They said it went against there ad policy. Yesterday at 9p.m I went to check how many followers I had before I went to sleep and saw that they had banned my account all together with no warnings what so ever. They didn‚Äôt give me a chance to do anything.

Quote from Zuckerberg‚Ä¶free expression, he said, has always been part of his company‚Äôs mission‚Äîbut sometimes people use their voices to put others in danger. Meta shouldn‚Äôt be making so many decisions on speech by itself.‚Äù So Meta created an Oversight Board, & Zuckerberg gave that board $150 million dollars to continue it‚Äôs work through 2025. I don‚Äôt think you can say the oversight board is independent if Zuckerberg paid to create it. If you want some entertainment, go read the bio‚Äôs for the current board members & tell me if it‚Äôs a diverse group of independent voices, as Zuckerberg claims. It‚Äôs clear that the board was created, not for the purpose Zuckerberg claims, but to ensure Meta can continue silencing who they want, & can blame the board if their actions are ever called into question. I see posts/videos CONSTANTLY from people inciting hate & violence, but they‚Äôre never taken down or have their accounts restricted. No Democrat politician who openly called on the public to intimidate & harass political opponents, & they weren‚Äôt silenced. 

My grandfather, who served the US military for 30 yrs, said that this country would begin losing it‚Äôs freedom if one political ideology ever gained control of the flow of information to the people.

The ad experience is now really intrusive, placing ads - sometimes multiple in a row - even when you are browsing one particular account‚Äôs recent posts (ads used to only be placed in your overall feed). The ad load is so incredibly high now that you very frequently see back to back ads separated by very little user generated content. Auto play for videos has always been annoying and now they‚Äôve implemented auto scrolling through multi-image posts. Why? If I‚Äôm interested, I will scroll to see subsequent photos myself. Sometimes the first image is a warning that a news story has graphic content so I opt not to look through the rest, but guess what? Next time I open the app, Instagram forces me to see the second graphic photo that followed the warning because it‚Äôs hellbent on making me consume that particular post until I have seen every photo in it. The app is now on a maniacal autopilot. It‚Äôs also unnerving that it favors showing you a post from a week ago over something more recent.

It‚Äôs a really fun app to use, and I enjoy posting my photos to it. But lately, I‚Äôve had many more complaints than positive notes. 
To start, Instagram‚Äôs inability to listen to the problems that its users have or try to fix them is incredibly frustrating. I was attempting to make a birthday post for a friend of mine; with a large number of photos selected and many tags. It took me well over forty-five minutes to make this post. It told me that my photos couldn‚Äôt post and that they would try again when they had a better connection. Naturally, I went to the internet, searching for a solution. I realized, after scrolling fairly far back in Reddit feeds, that this problem has been existing for over four years and Instagram has done nothing to fix it. One of the troubleshoot ideas a Redditor suggested was to log out and back into my account. When I did so, it deleted the post I was attempting to make and all of my drafts. The fact that this app can‚Äôt complete a basic function it was made to do- the creators chose the photo and tag limit, not the users- and then deletes the entirety of my work and my drafts is absurd and unwelcome.

Artists in particular are constantly brushed to the side to make way for unerage girls shaking their backsides and guys doing stupid parkour tricks that we‚Äôve seen a thousand times.
Recently I discovered that they AUTOMATICALLY put a sensitivity control on our accounts. The default is the ‚Äúlimited‚Äù option and it limits what ‚Äúsensitive content‚Äù you see. There have been posts made about how to turn this off. Howeverr for some unknown reason, I cannot. I can‚Äôt even get an explaination as to why I‚Äôm being treated like a child. So I‚Äôm conveniently stuck on the limited option with no app update and no way to turn it off. I‚Äôm undeniably angry. 
To further this, Instagram, and Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, has also come out and said they will be turning more into TikTok than focusing on being a picture-sharing platform like they‚Äôve always been. Mosseri posted a video on Twitter explaining this. So artists, once again, are being brushed aside and left in the dust so Instagram can try to be more like TikTok.
What I‚Äôm trying to say is if you are an artist or you want to share pictures, and you don‚Äôt have time to make Reels every single day to keep your head above water, do NOT get Instagram.

First off, after you post multiple pictures in one post, you should be able to delete some pictures out of the post without having to delete the whole post. This would make so many users more happy because there are countless times when you accidentally post one picture in a group of pictures that you don‚Äôt like, but you didn‚Äôt realize it in time and you already have many likes and comments so you don‚Äôt want to delete the whole post and you just stay stuck on what to do. Also, if you creators made a way to preview certain pictures on a private account that the creator of the account puts up that would be amazing! It‚Äôs difficult to tell who some people are sometimes when you are only able see their profile pic so if you were able to select a few pictures from camera roll to put up (no likes or comments involved) it would be a huge help.

 Thank you creators for the amazing app:)

I do have huge problems with the way the algorithm decides to filter, information or filter responses from people.  
Having an algorithm, take care of such a human necessity is a problem in and of itself, but I understand that a platform this large can‚Äôt possibly regulate in an accurate way the things that being said that should be regulated. 

For now, I think the irony of having community standards, and still being able to find videos of blatant things that are against those standards will have to do, but I do believe now that the good that can come from Instagram supersedes the bad.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-06T12:28:01-07:00

You would think this problem would be fixed by now because as it has come to my attention it‚Äôs not a small group of people suffering from this but instead A LARGE AMOUNT. I love Instagram but this small bug has really irritated me, because reposting and sharing posts to my story is important to me, especially in this time. 
I‚Äôm only 15 and I might sound naive but I can say that I am very, VERY disappointed that the company of Instagram, or whoever fixes these bugs has yet to fix this one. It is a big deal considering it is one of the MAIN features of this app and it can be fixed, I know it. SO, like any other bug, it needs to be fixed NOW!! Before everyone gets angry and starts to put negative ratings on this app. 
I‚Äôm rating this a four star because I have pity on the app itself. If it‚Äôs not going to be fixed and eventually ignored, I‚Äôll just delete it and put my rating lower. I know Instagram will see this because there are others who‚Äôve complained and have yet to be responded.

The app also chooses to implement other features that don't need to be added like changes to the profile page and making it more likely to mis-tap and hit a story button when trying to go back from messages than before. It chooses to implement these kinds of features instead of ones I, personally would really like like a feature to read all story's or better privacy.

I don‚Äôt know if I was supposed to go through all the videos but that‚Äôs disgusting to have to do that. The videos were of people having orgasms and a lot were of children and it looked to me that they were being raped. For one, nobody in their right mind, wants to look at that and for another if you took down so many of the videos on that account, I don‚Äôt know why you wouldn‚Äôt just delete the account altogether. This is children we‚Äôre talking about and these things should be taken care of as much as you can as an online website. I also noticed that your main page has so many Black Lives Matter posts, which is great, but what about the black lives being human trafficked. And there‚Äôs pages on Instagram that clearly show something is wrong and children are in danger. So what about promoting the fight against human trafficking??? It‚Äôs a bigger issue than you are presenting. Please make a change and help the world to be a safer place.

I had it for a few months and eventually my posts totaled to about 80. I had taken pictures of holidays, trips, vacations, my family, and my dog. For a while, everything was fine and I loved the app, but then I made another slime account. I made this account and started using both of them. After a few days, I was asked to put in my age for some reason on my first account. The one with all my memories. I put it in and the age said I was 12. I then had to try to put in my age a few more times, but I put the same age in. I then was forced off of my first account. I clicked the button to save my pictures, but it didn‚Äôt work. I was so confused because the app said I needed to be 12, but I got an email saying I  had to be thirteen. The app said YOU NEED TO BE 12 NOT 13!!!  I was so mad and upset. All of my memories were gone and I couldn‚Äôt recover my photos.  This needs to be fixed and I want my photos back. 
Another problem with the app is that you can‚Äôt have more than 1 account with one email. I had to start using my family‚Äôs email with their permission so I could have 2 accounts. I don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt have 2 accounts on one email. If o want 10 accounts, I will need 10 emails. That absurd.

It‚Äôs a great app for pics and stuff but good luck actually trying to contact a person if you need help. You will never talk to a human at all. And not only that, but they don‚Äôt tell you what happens for account errors. Just always some generic crap. On their support page it asks ‚ÄúWas this information helpful?‚Äù.... um, NO it was not. Connect me to an actual human. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs via phone, email or live chat. Just stop with all the robotic generic responses and let me actually talk to person that will (MAYBE) actually give me a reason for errors and stuff because the support page doesn‚Äôt cover some problems.

And for artists, despite being a platform *dedicated to sharing images* the quality of the drawings often get crunched. Instagram refuses to do anything about these problems. They could easily fix them yet they don‚Äôt.
Another thing is that it‚Äôs trying to be TikTok, it puts down every regular post in favor of reels. That‚Äôs a major issue if you‚Äôre an artist and don‚Äôt know how to animate. Circling back to the awful quality, it‚Äôs like compressing the image to its lowest form, I‚Äôm somewhat adding hyperbole but the quality is still awful. Bots are an INCREDIBLY large problem. I recently shared some art a few minutes ago and within a minute I got 5 bots telling me to ‚Äúüòçdm here at *insert huge NFT account that‚Äôs stealing art* ‚Äú there‚Äôs almost no way to stop yourself from getting these bots either. 
Another thing about the algorithm is that it hides posts from people. You could only be following one person and one hashtag but that persons post would be covered by reels and ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù posts. Absolutely awful.
In conclusion, it‚Äôs quite a bad app. The only reason I‚Äôm staying is so that the people who somehow DO see my art despite the horrid algorithm, can enjoy it if they don‚Äôt have Twitter.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-16T17:27:20-07:00

I try to contact them through the help forms almost on the daily because of bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed. I first want to talk about the image quality. It is a KNOWN Issue and has been for a while now. It should have been fixed long time ago. Second is all the glitches. I cant even count the times I have reported the same things over and over again. With no help of response back. If you dont care about your consumers just say it. Ive had to even google help forms to try to resolve the issue and there are hundreds of people with the same issue as me.. and guess what? No help from Instagram. On the daily it kicks me out of my account, tells me to verify, and change my password. Ive changed my password 20 TIMES in 2 months. I dont know how much verification you need. Ive even linked a tumblr and facebook to my account. Like it‚Äôs frustrating. Then a new thing is the ‚Äútry again later glitch‚Äù pops up every day and doesn‚Äôt let me see any of my followers list or other people‚Äôs follower list.

First of all, I know that there‚Äôs a highlights section for your stories, but I wish there could be a folder to combine posts. For example, I have a drawing account and it would be nice if I could have a place in my account where I could combine posts from past months. D‚Äôya know what I mean? I tried to screenshot all the posts from the past month, but it was just too much work. 
My second point is about stories. I know that y‚Äôall have added polls and ‚Äútype something‚Äù features. What if you added another feature like those two but the responses were anonymous to the person who posted the story. Sometimes I wanna respond to one of my friends, but I feel embarrassed or insecure about my answer. This feature is not a necessity, nor a need, but it would attract a lot of attention to the youth, like me. Anyway, I believe that these pieces of feedback will liven up the app. Hopefully y‚Äôall add at least one of these in.

It is a source for a lot of my creative inspiration and I love that aspect.  All the new tools that Instagram has incorporated into its app are so amazing and helpful. I look forward to the new features that they will one day include in the future.  One that I hope they include is the ability it add/edit postures once they have been uploaded.  This is something that I struggle with all the time, whenever I'm posting multiple pictures at a time using their sliding picture format, I cannot add onto, delete, or rearrange the order of these photos. I recently just uploaded a pair of two pictures to my page only later to realize that I forgot to add a third photo that I was planning to put.  I think it would be helpful if Instagram added an option to edit pictures in such a way that we are permitted to edit captions.  I do not wish to delete the whole post, but to simply add one more photo to my post.
