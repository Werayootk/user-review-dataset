I hope this never happens to me when I‚Äôm going to pick up an order and need to show it to someone in a store and swipe in the app to collect.\n\nAnother issue is that the distances shown in the map are straight line (or ‚Äúas the crow flies‚Äù) and don‚Äôt take into account the street grid or bodies of water such as rivers. While this approach might work fine for some areas it isn‚Äôt best suited for a dense urban environment where there are numerous businesses. Even when I have the filter set to the minimum 1 mile distance I see locations that are actually much further away because they would first require walking to a subway station or to a ferry landing to cross a river.

My problem is lack of selection - only the same 3-5 places show up within 2 mile radius and I‚Äôm in a dense area just a few blocks away from a very big and famous university with tons of restaurants in the area. The description of what might be offered is often very vague and we have no idea why places get the score they do.

It‚Äôs still a deal, but it was definitely disappointing and it made me wonder if maybe I wasn‚Äôt the first person to show up so they ended up loading the bags of the first few too good to go orders and then I was left with the scraps. It could be that the first visit I got super lucky but there‚Äôs no way to know.

If there was a catch, it would be that you have to be on the app right when the restaurant availability pops up or else they get sold out quickly if they‚Äôre popular. I‚Äôve used this many times and have gotten an outstanding amount of quality food for $4 in every instance. \n\nIt‚Äôs a win-win-win-win, for users getting a cheap meal, for the restaurants making some extra money by selling food they wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise sold and needed to throw away, for 2G2G for making a fee paid by restaurants, and humanity in general for reducing food waste. Absolutely no downside for anyone involved in the transaction that I can see. \n\nI never write reviews on here, but I am writing this  \n\nto help the app continue to expand its reach to more restaurants and continue growing and thriving.

The app says to check back at 7:20 pm and each day so far nothing has been posted from the place even when checking throughout the day just in case. I wouldn‚Äôt have as big of an issue with it if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that the app then has it shown that the surprise bags from the store were sold out even though none were ever posted.\n\nI figure the app will get more places over time so I will keep checking it; however, I really think they need to make a change that simply says the place didn‚Äôt have any surprise bags for sale for that day if that is the case instead of claiming they sold out for that day.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-15T08:34:45-07:00"},{"id":"9115298285","userName":"Wanderlust73","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36297695","version":"22.9.0","score":3,"title":"Good idea but not fully there yet","text":"This is an excellent concept from and environmental and economic stance. However, many of these places already offer discounted food in day old items and therefore the savings is not accurate. I have bought three bags now and another with my wife‚Äôs app, and I can tell you that the money it says you saved is wrong because the price shown is the value of what you‚Äôre buying. So you need to subtract what you paid to see the actual savings. Also, some places are just\nNot worth it particularly when you give up warmth, freshness and choice. I got a bag of say old Jalape√±o bagels for $3.29\nWhen I could‚Äôve paid $5 to pick the bag of day old bagels of choice.

But unfortunately the developers of this application cannot guarantee the quality, quantity and freshness of the food that buyers get from sellers. I had a bad experience - I bought surprise bags 3 times and all 3 times the food was very stale, tasteless and it was a very ridiculous amount! for example, in a pizzeria, they gave me 2 slices of a small pizza for $5, which are supposedly $18 at the original price, as said in the app.  The price of a whole pizza in this pizzeria is $12-13, I could just come there without an app and buy the same 2 slices of pizza for the same money, at any time convenient for me. In general, this application plays in favor of sellers, buyers do not win anything, they just buy not fresh food, which is most often a place in the trash can!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-14T18:09:47-07:00"},{"id":"7807257339","userName":"BeeVixen","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id397828371","version":"21.6.4","score":1,"title":"nice in theory, but....","text":"...it needs work.  a lot of work.\n\nthe rating system seems intentionally misleading and vague.  they interchange metrics (3 stars vs 4 stars) and hope you won‚Äôt notice.  for instance, ‚Äú80% of customers rate this place 3 stars or more‚Äù could mean that 80% rate the restaurant at 3 stars, 20% rate it at 4 stars, and 0% rate it at 5 stars... OR it could mean that 100% of customers rate the restaurant at 5 stars.  just use a star system like every other rating website does?\n\nadditionally, it‚Äôs super easy for restaurant owners to game the system.  i paid $5 for a bag valued at $18.. i got a reheated can of Campbell‚Äôs soup that probably cost the restaurant less than $1.  i lost money on food that i didn‚Äôt even eat (i love clam chowder but not old canned chowder) and i lost money on gas driving over there.  i reached out to the company via the receipt for a refund and did not receive a response. \n\nfor this to work, it needs to be fruitful and fair  for both restaurants and customers, there need to be consequences for restaurants who cheat customers and they need to have a responsive customer service team for when these things happen.  buying a ‚Äúmystery bag‚Äù of anything requires trust and i don‚Äôt feel like this company presents itself as being very trustworthy.  i hope they get things ironed out.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-09-14T20:02:36-07:00"},{"id":"9139976929","userName":"dghsvshs","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id885483323","version":"22.9.10","score":1,"title":"Waste of time and money","text":"Businesses partners don‚Äôt have hours of operation updated.

The other 2 ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù bags I claimed the restaurant was closed upon arrival and the company has a long behold process to refund the money you pay for this junk. It‚Äôs a great concept but it needs a strong desire and partnership between the app and the restaurants.
