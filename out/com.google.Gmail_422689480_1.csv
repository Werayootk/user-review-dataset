First, when composing an email, you can‚Äôt swipe it down to refer to another email in your inbox. You have to copy what you‚Äôve typed, tap X to cancel the new email, look at the other email to get your information and then start your email over again by pasting onto a new email because it often doesn‚Äôt save the draft of the email I started.
Second, it‚Äôs more difficult to copy a photo in the body of your email or add as an attachment. Sometimes it will do neither and ask to add it as a file or on Google Drive.
Third, and most importantly, it seems to have nowhere near the storage capacity as Hotmail. I‚Äôve used Hotmail for over ten years and never had a notification that I was running out of storage and that I should buy more. I‚Äôve only used Gmail for about five years and I‚Äôm getting the notification that I have 83% of my storage used. I also have Google Photos app, so that may have contributed to that, but I have a number of photos and recordings on Hotmail too.
