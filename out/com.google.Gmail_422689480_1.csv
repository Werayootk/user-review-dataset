First, when composing an email, you can’t swipe it down to refer to another email in your inbox. You have to copy what you’ve typed, tap X to cancel the new email, look at the other email to get your information and then start your email over again by pasting onto a new email because it often doesn’t save the draft of the email I started.
Second, it’s more difficult to copy a photo in the body of your email or add as an attachment. Sometimes it will do neither and ask to add it as a file or on Google Drive.
Third, and most importantly, it seems to have nowhere near the storage capacity as Hotmail. I’ve used Hotmail for over ten years and never had a notification that I was running out of storage and that I should buy more. I’ve only used Gmail for about five years and I’m getting the notification that I have 83% of my storage used. I also have Google Photos app, so that may have contributed to that, but I have a number of photos and recordings on Hotmail too. The storage issue is the reason I am going back to Hotmail.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T15:38:05-07:00
