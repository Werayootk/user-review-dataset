Now I’m addicted to them, I’m on order five or six already. The shipping is not like Prime, so be prepared to wait a bit, but so far nothing has taken more than about ten days.

The prices are great and to hard to pass up. I love the extra discounts I get and coupons they send me. The biggest compliment I have is how they ship items. I have had several items come in damaged and had to get refunded. I hate when They send merchandise in the bags instead of boxes. But even when it’s sent in boxes the packing isn’t the best and things come in damage. That being said their return procedure very easy to do. The prices are unbelievable. And I love that they give you a price adjustment if the price goes down after you buy. However you have to check your orders daily to see if a price adjustment is available and you have to request it because it is not automatic.

Unless you have dozens of people who have never played before and download the app for the first time, you’re out of luck. I understand that it shouldn’t be easy to get the rewards, but they also do not allow you to “pay the difference”. You either win it all, or get nothing and have to pay full price.

A lot of the so called “offers” from the app were fake offers trying to get you to buy more or capture your data. For example, 1 offer was “free item for new user” so it asks you to pick an item. But after doing so, you are required to buy/select 6 more items at cost to get the 1 free. So it’s not really free.

This can result in increased revenue for the company, which can be used to fund research and development of new products, as well as improve their current offerings. \n\nSecondly, by shipping to other countries, Temu can gain valuable insights into different markets and consumer preferences. This can help them tailor their products to better suit the needs of their customers, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. \n\nFinally, by expanding their shipping, Temu can establish themselves as a global brand, which can lead to increased brand recognition and awareness. This can help them compete with other companies in the same industry, and can also attract potential investors and partners. \n\nOverall, I think that expanding your shipping to other countries can be a great opportunity for Temu. However, there may be challenges and obstacles to overcome, such as shipping costs, customs regulations, and language barriers. Nonetheless, I believe that if Temu approaches this with a strategic and thoughtful plan, they can successfully expand their shipping and reap the benefits that come with it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-15T02:34:29-07:00"},{"id":"10261201065","userName":"HeartBrokenByKlarna","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1529741730","version":"1.96.0","score":3,"title":"Minor flaw… and Yet please take my review in to consideration and add this feature.","text":"Temu needs to add a reporting option within the app. If an item is missing or damaged during delivery or an item or items never gotten delivered , a help option should be available for customers being able to scroll and go right to and not just having found out months later that hey if I leave a negative review I can then and now be given an option to ask for a refund… New customers like myself and I’ve just experienced what I just stated shouldn’t have to go threw the difficulties that I have just to report an issue.\n\n I love the listings and I truly appreciate the reasonable and affordable prices on a lot of items I’ve seen so far. Stay reasonable and please add a customer service help option within the app.\n\nGreat work advertising by the way.
