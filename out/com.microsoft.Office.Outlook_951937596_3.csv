7250543859,scenographer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38101327,4.2115.2,5,Took a little getting used to but now I love it,"Initially I had trouble connecting SMTP mail servers. I kept getting password error messages and occasionally connected email profiles would disconnect and the problem would start all over again. For no reason that I could fathom, the exact same credentials (pasted) would then suddenly start working again. This seems to have settled down now and things are working as they should. 

At first the interface seemed clunky but after getting used it it feels very efficient. 

Pros: 
Spam control!
My biggest complaint against Apple’s mail app is complete lack of spam recognition. No matter how many times you junk spam emails, the same stupid emails keep showing up in the inbox several times a day. Blocking senders is pointless because every junk email has a unique sender. The Outlook app did away with most of them after just one junking session! Sweet!

Functionality
Although the app takes a little exploration to find where things are and how they work, it has many of the bells and whistles of the desktop app. 

Cons:
Inability to sort threads from newest to oldest. Judging by forum posts spanning many years, this is a long standing gripe among users. But I’ll trade it for spam recognition any day.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-22T04:20:14-07:00

Number one, the search function is garbage. You can literally search the same term in the desktop version and in the app version and get utterly different results. My main result using the app search is literally nothing, even when I’m using sender email or contents of email. I guess it could be worse but if you are without desktop access and need to find an email older than this week or month, good luck. 

Number two, there is no interoperability between iCal and outlook. If you’re using a secure email system and can’t link the account to your mail app, you have no way of using the calendar. So you end up having two calendars on one phone. I’m pretty sure not having to do this is one of the main benefits of a smart phone, but i guess Apple and Microsoft still hate each other more than they care about customer service, so you can’t get outlook events in your Apple calendar. Or vice versa. Has led to me missing several appointments as a result.

Finally, for whatever reason printing and PDFing within this app is extremely clunky. You basically have to trick it into triggering apple’s native pdf creation in order to get it to work properly. I don’t know why it’s so difficult to just forward attachments or other documents but it’s not great. 

It does the job so I’m not giving it 1 star, but the user experience vastly underwhelms.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-21T07:36:13-07:00

The other is if I copy and paste something else into the email that is a different font color/style or comes up as a different font color/style, I can’t change the font color/style to match everything else.

Then if you are silly enough to try to edit your archive, or really any of your folders, don’t select more that two or three to move or erase at a time, because the app can’t handle you selecting more than that.  It will crash and you will have to start all over.

And yet I use it infrequently, only when I really need its capabilities.  I’d love to use it exclusively.  So why don’t I?  Three big reasons.  (1) it’s slow to start.  When I open Mail, it’s always there. No load time.  When I open Outlook, I can wait 1-3 seconds for the darn thing to load if it hasn’t been active recently.  That’s a drag. (2) what’s worse, the messages are not auto downloaded.  So I open the app, then wait for 5-10 seconds or pull down to refresh and wait 5 seconds to see new messages.  What?  Why?!  (3) minor... but I’d like to have calendar and mail separately so I can look up my calendar while responding to an email.  

Microsoft, please, please solve at least issues 1 and 2 and I will happily carry the banner of Outlook for iOS.  Until then you are just upsetting me but giving me such a fantastic app that I can’t use effectively due to these major flaws.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-09T19:21:51-07:00

Just reinstalled Outlook again and I see where after what is now approaching nearly nine years, one still can’t sort conversation threads properly. Uninstalling and reverting back to the default iOS Mail app. Fingers crossed it’ll be fixed when I look again in a few months. 

We're two days away from the six-year anniversary of Microsoft's rebranding of Acompli and theystill haven't fixed the sort order within a conversation thread. Newest emails belong at the top of the thread as it is in the desktop version (and as it was in WM as well). Even the default iOS mail app gives you the option. And why does your account icon show a picture when you have contact photos enabled and only one account but a letter when you have more than one - both my work and personal account descriptions start with same letter (I'm supposed to remember which color refers to which account - and yes, I can change the account description, but I shouldn't have to).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-27T09:30:05-07:00

To my surprise, however, unless Exchange is being used, there is no syncing with an Outlook calendar on the PC. I am not using Exchange, so my workaround was to add my iCloud account and then have it sync with my PC running iCloud for Windows. No joy. Syncing of ""all day"" events was random and arbitrary at best.

Nor does the app support syncing with the PC's Task list even if (I believe) the user is on Exchange. This is a major issue for me.

Finally, the app does not play well with IMAP email accounts. First, it took a ton of time to set up the account because the ""automatic"" setup did not work. In the end I opted to set the account up manually, but it still took several tries. Once up and running, receiving emails seemed ok, but on average over 45 seconds would elapse before I heard the chime notifying me that my email had been successfully sent. Repeated re-adding and re-setting of the IMAP account did nothing to move the ""sent"" elapsed time any closer to the normal 5 seconds needed by the native IOS Mail app.

In summary, if you play in both the Apple and Microsoft worlds, there are better alternatives out there. That said, the idea of Outlook on the iPhone is a worthwhile one.

And, finally, an incredibly annoying and problematic problem:  if I’m drafting an email and move to another screen or app and come back to edit or continue writing, and try to place the cursor where I want to write, the cursor jumps to the very bottom of the screen even if the email chain is 10 emails long. I can’t get the cursor back to where I need it. Sometimes if I close the email and reopen it, it may work but only sometimes. Unbelievably frustrating. I haven’t talked to our company IT team about it yet, but this is becoming very problematic. Must be fixed. All this on iOS 13.3",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-13T18:34:34-07:00

I could wait for WEEKS and the error still wouldnt fix itself. Ive found that when this happens the only way to sign back in is to completely delete the app then redownload it. Sometimes even that doesn’t fix the issue until I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app 6 times within one day. Extremely unreliable and annoying. So glad I graduate in four months so that I hopefully never have to use this crappy excuse for an email service ever again",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-05T14:27:07-07:00

It took four days to get (almost) everything back. The calendar is definitely a downgrade from the native calendar. Contacts have to be re-imported and even if you have photos attached in Outlook on your PC, they don’t carry over. If you try to add a photo to the contact on your phone you find out that “photos are not supported”.  Really?  That should be an easy fix. And you can’t edit your contact from the contact list. The fix?  You have to create a second contact on your phone, add a photo and then link the two together. What a pain!  And don’t count on your notes from Outlook coming over. Nooooo, you have to download OneNote and connect to that so you can view them in the Sticky Notes. Come on Microsoft. This is why Apple continues to dominate the market.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-15T05:19:00-07:00
