If you‚Äôre just reading emails and never need to send, I guess the app is fine for that. Writing emails is an exercise in frustration for me with this app!!!

The app works okay but writing emails on it using an iPhone can be very frustrating. It is trying to do its own spell check and grammar check while the iOS native spell checking is also functioning and these seem to me to interfere with each other. The same goes for when it makes ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù about completing a word or phrase. It appears to me that it is not well integrated with same functions native to iOS.

11023188468,Shaniebanannie,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id438662239,4.2408.1,1,Minimal Functionality,"I‚Äôve had this app for years and it continues to disappoint. Why does Outlook desktop, web app, and mobile apps refuse to work together and provide users with a unified experience? It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard with a software service that‚Äôs almost as old as I am. 

Keeping my inbox organized in an automated way is nearly impossible while using this app. The rules you can apply via the web app don‚Äôt have commonality to manipulate when your emails can be moved. For example: I can‚Äôt adjust categories, flag state (except to clear it), or level of importance in the iOS app, but those are a few of the things I can build rules around in the web app to help me keep my inbox sorted. 

Its not so hard to think that once I‚Äôve read an email, I would like and file the email away in a folder based on the parameters I‚Äôve programmed unless I‚Äôve added a flag OR pinned the email. Don‚Äôt even get me started on why Outlooks logic statements only have ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù as an exception instead of or in addition to ‚ÄúOr‚Äù.  Its a very basic concept, and yet outlook lacks it entirely. Or even just a rule that can apply more than one category or change the status of flags. The only way to program these types of rules is to use the desktop app, and most people don‚Äôt even have home computers these days, so what‚Äôs the point? 

And it makes me cringe when I see so much effort put into the whole ‚Äúfocused‚Äù inbox or moving unread emails to different locations, which inevitably makes me miss emails. Outlook clearly doesn‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù that a huge population experiences and needs to get with the neurodivergent times to provide more flexibility to keep users email organized while streamlining the visual experience so users only have to check 1 location that isn't clutter by the 50,000 emails that the users don‚Äôt have time to manually move once they‚Äôve been read.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-08T15:03:02-07:00
