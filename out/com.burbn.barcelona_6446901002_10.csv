Threads seems to favor social discourse and sexual content over the wellbeing of things. I know Instagram seems to have a lot of censorship towards certain topics, and I can find this to be the case here as well. This is basically an even worse version of twitter before Elon took over.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T23:50:21-07:00

My only complaint is that there isn’t a fleshed out desktop version, but considering how new it is, I’ll give it a pass.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-15T11:05:45-07:00
10230512580,Queen lady human XIII,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id465508298,294.0,3,let me see people I follow!!!,i would love it a lot more if i only saw the people i followed. or if there was a way to separate “suggested” from “following” and i could switch between the two when i wanted. because otherwise i stop scrolling after only a few posts because i’m realizing it’s not anyone that i actually follow.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-07T09:46:58-07:00

The only way you can “keep” something you like it by re sharing it . So maybe like do a private like just how Instagram is . How you have to go into settings to see what you’ve liked .",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-30T02:37:18-07:00

I hope we can make this all into something and not ruin it politically like Twitter. It is missing a lot of key components like personal messages and general app customization. But def had potential,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-08T21:57:13-07:00

10119017158,Nateh128,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33655078,289,3,Great start,"I’m hoping this can be a permanent replacement for Twitter. Main points of annoyance:
 - Whenever I open the app, rather than letting me start from where I was it jumps up to a random point in the feed 
 - Badly needs following-only chronological feed
 - Recommendations are random, like influencers I wouldn’t care about, vs driven by the people I follow 
 - No desktop version",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-08T16:59:04-07:00
10114042598,Kate Michele,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1171308584,289,3,Meh. Potential but nothing special yet.,It has potential but they didnt fix what the issue was with twitter. You still can not edit a post after it has been shared. You also see a bunch of posts of accounts you are not following. Which defeats the purpose of trying to control the feed with things you chose.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T08:11:24-07:00
