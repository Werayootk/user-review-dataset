I love your app, I love the fact that you can edit sounds, add text, do voiceovers, and the fact that it is free and easy to use! However, I do have some simple suggestions. \n\n1. The spaces when you put apostrophes are to long, it looks as if there are a couple spaces between the characters whenever an apostrophe is added.\n2. Sometimes, the background of a photo isn‚Äôt a png whenever you try to make it a png, and blends in with the object you‚Äôre trying to keep (EX: Like an emoji blending in with the background and some of the emoji falling out or some of the background blending in with the emoji and not getting removed.)\n3. Sometimes, the voiceovers aren‚Äôt able to be slowed down and sometimes you can‚Äôt hear them. This is really rare though and has only happened one time.\n\nI love your app and I love almost everything in it. However, i think these suggestions need to be added in game.

If I try to move it after the overlay was added, the thing on the main track moves out of the centering and I have to do the centering all over again. Not to mention the sizing messed up as well, when the blue bar on the side of the image is supposed to turn white and snap to the edge, it doesn‚Äôt do that. Instead, what it does is snap to random parts without the edge of the image on the edge of the format. I hope you fix this soon, cause I have a video I‚Äôd like to finish without any of these issues.

It is easy to use and supports many apps. I love the easy key frame usage and everything else about it. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that you can only use 5 overlays. \n\nThe reason this is a big problem is when I save it and transfer it to another draft I can‚Äôt fix any issues that I notice later on and I have to go way back to the other videos to fix it.\n\n I would be so grateful if you could add other overlays, that is the only thing that I can find wrong w/ the app. Please fix this so I can make better edits. Thank you and goodbye. ü•≤","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-08-02T20:11:27-07:00"},{"id":"8800891789","userName":"someone._.unu","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1117091246","version":"6.1.0","score":4,"title":"Please solve this issue","text":"The app is great and all the overlays and the effects and everything like audio speed and stuff like that worked all fine for awhile until I came across a bug or issue that I would really hope to be fixed asap.
