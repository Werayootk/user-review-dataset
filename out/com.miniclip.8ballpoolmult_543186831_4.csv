The 8 ball reappears & “Hasan” gets the ball & ends up “WINNING”   No integrity in this game that’s why I’ll never spend a penny on this fake game run by BOTS!

I would like a to make a request and this is the only way I know how where someone might notice. I hate how the matches default at the highest possible bet. This is very annoying because on mobile a slight tap instead of a scroll can match you up with someone for an amount you did not want to bet. I have had times where I accidentally pressed just a little and ended up in a game for 1-5 million coins instead of a simple 50 match. This is also the same with the other playlists where you choose your bet. The default is the highest amount of coins you can bet. I really think making the default the lowest amount you can bet would be a million times better. Additionally, it makes more sense to just have it go from the lowest amount so I can scroll to the right and play for more if I want without worrying.

My only problems are that there is a dumb rule and an annoying glitch. There is for some reason a rule that if you do not hit one of your own balls with the cue ball it is automatically counted as a scratch even if you make a shot. This occasionally leaves me with situations where all I can do is try to do some insane shot to get my cue ball around my opponents ball and tap my own or else they can get an easy shot. My other problem is a glitch where I will sometimes lose matches for no reason. At one point I lost three matches in a row and lost in game money as well as trophies even though I had won all three matches. Other than this I would give it four stars because it is fun and not pay to win yet not a revolutionary game that is good enough to play over pc games and spend a ton of time on. Overall I would recommend it.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-11T14:44:29-07:00

I realize I need to hone my skills but when I am rank inked in single or double digits keep getting pitted against those in triple digits I just have to stop playing altogether for a while which isn't letting me enjoy the game. Also the fact that the emojis are used in an irritable manner to goad  you and distract you from making your shot. Good players  have respect and don't need to stoop to such tactics. I do wish  these points could be considered and dealt with. Giving of emojis and chat packs to try and diminish another's capabilities is in bad form  from the developer and the use of them  is juvenile and just plain rude and annoying   
Other than that I really do enjoy playing on a daily basis. 
Oh and what's up with jumping all over the place with the giving of cue prices. Can we not  just strive for pieces of a cue then after being granted a cue go on to another ? I cannot get one I  want nor want the ones I get and cannot buy the good ones because I just can't afford it on a pension so I am at a disadvantage from the start.
O.k. Now writing this review has mad me  upset with the casualties of gaming and distracted me from the  pleasure.

I don’t normally but when you find yourself in a great run basically a skunk match to beat the opponent the physics of the game changes to give you a disadvantage and give the loosing opponent an opportunity to catch up. I really get frustrated when the que ball will continue to roll further then it was able to in previous shots to make you scratch and give the advantage to the loosing opponent. It’s extremely unfair for the game to do so and I’ve played enough to know and be comfortable with a winning shot no reason for any kind of error yet the ball scratches. It’s pretty messed up they would do so when u add the slightest bit of power to a shot.

Then out of nowhere I get 3 2ks. And I don’t no why we have to recharge a cue. Because in real life it doesn’t take 100 coins to recharge a cue. You don’t even recharge cues in real life. And don’t even get me started on how fast they run out. When it says cue has to recharge I felt I just charged it like 1 minute ago. The pass is OK.

Unfortunately, this means that in many (most?) games the winner is predetermined. If the game wants you to lose, you WILL lose. As others have mentioned, you line up a shot that should be straight into the hole and it misses. Not by a little - by a lot. I mean hitting the cushion outside the pocket and on the rail. Also, you might be beating an opponent that is struggling and all of a sudden they make 5 shots in a row to beat you. Even difficult ones. The last straw for me was that while I was playing well, building coins and increasing levels, I was playing opponents who were at very similar levels. Then I started playing in the more expensive rooms (higher bets) and suddenly I’m matched against players who are 30 to 40 levels above me. A couple of times they cleared the table and I didn’t get to shoot. I felt as though the game wanted me to lose a whole bunch of coins so that they could sell me more.

It constantly tries to get you to spend money in about 100 different ways (ex: scratch off tickets, wheel spins, crates, elite status, vip, coins, cash, and many many more). To do just about anything in the game you have to spend in game currency (ex: new cues, upgrading cues, different avatars, messages emotes, etc). The crates that you get from winning sometimes take upwards of 8 hours to open and I wouldn’t be surprise if later on they take even longer. Every single game you have to pay credits that you’ll lose even if you just want to play a casual game. God forbid you want to play a single player game to practice you STILL have to pay credits. Ironically it’s a pretty decent looking game up until you lose OR win and then it goes back to spamming you with different offers in an attempt to get you to spend money.

Its unfair when people have these god sticks with time added to there stick. 9 ball is based on speed, so every shot you make chunks the timer. But people with time on their sticks get plenty of time to take there shots. Then after they take there shots there time gets almost reset entirely. Its not fair to use sticks that add time to a game that is time sensitive. Another thing that makes the games so unpleasant is that there needs to be a call 9 ball shot. Sick of games where people are just slapping balls around and just so happen they get lucky and sink the 9 ball by mistake. Its a good game mode but completely unfair and not balanced what so ever.

Problem is during 2023 Christmas event I was robbed of some cash from buying surprise boxes, I’d only be able to open 2 of the 3 that I buy with my cash which was upsetting. It’s like the second I opened would glitched out and not give me anything. I usually save my cash but I really wanted to complete the challenge.

I’m not really into strategy games, but the tables are a different. You are supposed to adapt to your surroundings. Your opponent effects the field as much as you do. This game taught me a lot where I want to hit real tables. These are real virtual scenarios just without the exact frictional physics. You can’t accurately calculate that with every mechanic in this game. This game will go really far. Developers a salute to you & the upmost respect. I have other ideas for this game I’d like to pitch.

That being said, I’d give it 4 stars for the motivation of improvement. To the future players save the coins, tournaments are your friends, add friends who defeats you (networking also helps build skills & free coins); don’t be so quick to build your sticks unless you want cue power rewards and saved for trophy tables. ‘Cash is king’ you need it but it’s useful if you spend it strategically.

It makes more sense to get rid of any low tier boxes to keep the player in the game if all he wants to do is get higher tier boxes.

3. Please get better chat packs. Out if all the ones i own i only use 10 of them. They are horrible. Or just give players the option to chat in match or to mute them.

This way it does make it more interesting i guess but the stupid slot thing gives you a chance to win 50,000 or more pool coins and I have tried hundreds of times and never got more then 500.. It is set to give you less and that makes this kinda bs.. What would it hurt them to give you 30,000 pool coins? I am sure many people pay for money and keep them in the green.

UPDATE because they won't stop asking me to rate it even though I already did...
The wheel thing to win money or stuff is worse now.. I have seen the thing slowing to stop I a big number and the go past it REAL slow. I would rather not even have this unfair wheel thing.i did get 1000 on it one time but most the time I get 52 or 12.... Fun game though.
UPDATE AGAIN!!They keep asking me to update so here it the newest scam they are doing. When you watch a video to get 150 coins it gives the 150 a few times and lets you keep doing it but then only gives 15 coins even though it clearly says watch a video to get 150 coins. They have also added something that you can challenge your friends, friends. It will pop up looking like you have a challenge but it is telling you someone is on line and you can challenge them.
I still play the game and like it but all this extra crap makes it worse. I would GLADLY pay $5 to have no ads and no pop up crap!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-13T09:17:19-07:00

It was like there was nothing I could do about it and I went from winning all the time to losing all the time. So I deleted the app feeling cheated. After a couple years I started playing again. The exact same thing is happening! It’s bizarre. I watch the opponents ball hardly roll. I can barely hit the cue ball and it will roll right in to a pocket across the table repeatedly and I will lose. It doesn’t matter what stick I have earned or bought. As a matter of fact the better the stick the worse it gets. 

Also I noticed I am missing close up shots that are clearly aimed dead center into the pocket. Once the money and earnings are diminished the first thing that pops up is purchase more coins.

And when you play a game and the person each person breaks and runs all the balls and shoots in a ball and you don’t get a shot they should make you play again or something I don’t know it just seems unfair to me so I’ll be debating this game thank you have a wonderful day.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-20T07:52:23-07:00

If you’re a competitive pool player though, don’t expect real physics.  The ball can move at impossible speeds and you can shoot at impossible angles. Size of the table isn’t realistic leading to many more scratches than in real pool.  Unfortunately, the developers did a lousy job on the precision of the shot controls which you must use to aim.  They will sometimes fail you at the most crucial moments - all of a sudden the aiming slider mechanism stops working precisely causing you to miss otherwise easy shots.  Finally, if you advance to the highest levels (mostly at Paris and higher, 2.5M+),  mostly you’re playing robots with fake stats who are there to cheat you out of your coins.  Your perfect break technique will stop sinking any balls and the shot aiming mechanism will suddenly fail to aim more often.  Very often, the robots will “win” the game without you getting a single fair turn to shoot.  Does that sound like a fun experience?  Would be more fun to play other people instead of fake cheating robots.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-02-02T12:01:44-07:00

All the spins give you is the lowest priced coins on the wheel. And it is really annoying. And the lucky shots are also stupid. I try to aim for the red or the gold, and I do sometimes hit the gold but it's useless. WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH 5 CASH?!?! WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH 500 COINS OR 1K COINS?!?!? Absolutely nothing. So if those mini games weren't so darn useless and annoying and give will actually give you high priced coins when you NEED THEM, especially when you lose high priced tables, you'll lose lots of coins.

The most obvious problem had to be the Spin and Win. Out of the entire time I’ve played this game, I can only remember one time I got something higher than $500.
The new “ Lucky Shot “ is an absolute joke. The game sets you up in the craziest ways ( ball blocking other ball, etc ). Another issue is the power control. I play this game on a phone, so the power slot is on the left of the screen. I am clumsy some times, but often  when I’m positioning my shot ( pulling cue downwards ), my thumb slides the power which shoots the shot. The cue ball more than not, won’t even strike another ball, which means I’m then awarded a penalty. I absolutely hate the cue recharge. It’s not even a realistic concept. I also do think that the packs are kind of overpriced, but it’s no big deal. The game does have good graphics and an easy to navigate menu. Clubs are a fun concept and the boxes are good rewards.

5906361422,timwalker2001,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id172287682,4.8.5,3,Rigged,"This game is ultimately used to get over boredom. The only way to achieve success in this game is to buy into it. Lucky Shot is awfully rigged, one time you can pull the cue to a certain point and it send the ball flying. Another time you can pull the cue back just as far and it barely move. The games are just as rigged. You’ll shoot a perfectly in like shot, and somehow the ball will curve when the cue, ball, and pocket were linear. This game can be fun, but in order to do good past a certain point, you need to buy credits, bucks, lucky shots, scratchers, etc. It’s a waste of time. Deleted the app at Level 61. 

UPDATE:
Redownloaded it temporarily, and won a scratcher for like 100K. Bet it on 1 game, went for the 9 ball shot, and pull the cue ALL the way back, and it barely struck the ball, moving it hardly any at all. This game is extremely rigged and designed to take your money. You will NOT ACHIEVE success in this game if you don’t buy into the pool pass, the coins, bucks, extra scratchers, extra spins, etc etc. Huge waste of time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-05T08:13:43-07:00

The physics are solid (unless you count not being able to scratch the cue off the table as realistic).  The angles, and the banks, are fun to achieve.  My problems have been random crashes- but only during selections of items from the main screen, never during gameplay gratefully.  Also, there are some minor tweaks I believe would make it more fun- like auto selecting the same venue after winning a match to run on a ring or achievement, instead of having to scrollscrollscroll to get back to the same venue repeatedly.  But all in all, exactly the type of PvP challenge I was hoping for.  Even offline playing is great for being away from Wi-Fi.  Solid!  *****5 stars*****",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-05T11:26:02-07:00

The relaxing sounds and ball movement is accurate and therapeutic. The skill cap for players who want to become the next Efren Reyes is right at your finger tips. However, for the past several months there has been a cheat that is ruining the game entirely for the players who have spent years building their skill level. Miniclip has refused to comment on whether they are going to patch this cheat. To put it into perspective, some tables that are meant for the top players are now unplayable, infiltrated by these hackers. At face value, this isn’t a huge problem because you can simply play lesser tables, but the problem is that for high ranking players, earnings equate to rewards that are being taken by the cheaters. While I’d love to rate this game 5/5, the lack of transparency for months on end by miniclip is beyond unacceptable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-18T03:52:42-07:00

While the game can be fun if u don't pay u are never going to go to that next level u as a competitive player want to reach. There have been times where Ive won 8 games in a row and WITHOUT paying a dollar Ive been able to earn up to 1M coins however once u have reached that level for some reason you will start loosing games. Somehow your ball will land in a bad spot that will not allow u to hit any of your balls and this will happen towards the end of each match even though I hit the ball with certain force and spin to make sure it lands in the right spot u know like good pool players do. This will cause me to loose at some point 7 matches in a row and while I am not taking away credit from my opponent it’s obvious the game is doing this on purpose so u can lose games and be forced to spend real money which I’ve never done just like other games like FIFA, Madden Do. Its a shame bc its a good game made pay to win",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-05T11:53:00-07:00
6757505219,Nakakakkaksjsa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id416921433,5.2.3,1,Scammed unfortunately,"This game is not about if you are good unfortunately. This game has been programmed to mess with us, sadly. I’m still investigating this but so far I have noticed that there is a algorithm. The game will know if you have been winning constantly and once you have hit a good amount of winning streak you WILL go on a losing streak no matter what. You can be curve ball perfectly and place ball perfectly but somehow it will put you in a difficult position and make you lose your opportunity to win and then make the other opponent win. It is a cycle you just have to wait until the program will finally get you back on that winning streak. 

If you look at other reviews they have similar issues where if you mess up once the opponent will sweep up the table and you will lose (most likely computer opponent, not real player) or the game will make you lose to the point you lost enough money and finally get you some big wins. 

As a programmer I am going to look More into this because this is absolutely not fair and a scam. Please do not play",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-15T15:57:28-07:00
