1. The cueball will get sucked straight into a pocket
2. You barely have the break 
2. You will rarely pot a ball on break
3. If you do get a ball on break the cueball will be stuck behind a different one which is almost always impossible to get out of to continue your turn 
4. If 1 thru 3 didn‚Äôt happen then a target ball will just bounce side to side in front of a pocket even if the shot is clear as day
