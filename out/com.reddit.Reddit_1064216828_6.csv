Friendly UI - Reddit’s form factor is strong, being that users can surround themselves with not only the media they wish to consume but what its vast and diverse user base promote and demote on a daily basis.

Reddit is still among other existing social platforms. If the form factor of all existing social platforms were to be condensed, akin to the newspapers of old, human consumption of media would be far more organized. Reddit is a crude go at that- a majority of the communities are informal and leave moderation to users who take personal stake in the guidelines of their “sub-Reddit”. Alongside the informalities of Reddit, I scroll by improperly sorted posts reaching popular status daily.

All of that taken into account the platform itself is incredibly useful when seeking trusted information which allows its users to formulate their own opinions on subjects presented to them. If given the proper support (higher clearance), Reddit could open our planet to properly presented information based on its karmic infrastructure.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-17T11:09:03-07:00

Other than that, the reddit video player (as in the video is uploaded directly to reddit and not linked from another site)- the reddit video player will freeze or just not play my video.

Now with this video update, it’s a worse experience than having to hit “back” to confirm selections in iOS.

I prefer to swipe left/right to go between posts. When you get to a video though, you can’t scroll through the comments and have the video pause and scroll away. Instead, it sits there playing with the audio blasting. Want to quickly mute it? You can’t. You need to tap the video which expands it, then mute it. One you tapped the video though, the UI functions entirely differently. If you swipe right, you don’t go to the next post — it jumps you back to the list view of posts. Want to go back to the comments? Swiping up doesn’t return you to the normal video with comments — it goes to the next video, not even the next post!

However, a lot of the time it just brings you to the apps home page and not to the thread in question. It’s really irritating primarily because the search system in the app isn’t always productive.

• The search is ok for finding subreddits, it’s not useful for finding specific threads.

• When you’re viewing a thread you used to be able to hide comment chains by swiping right. A recent update changed this to now you have to tap to the right of the commenter’s name. If you have a smaller phone it’s very easy to fat finger and go to the users page or just not do anything.

Reddit is free as a service. So the ads DO make sense. They need to pay their bills to keep the servers running. Add that in with the post and comment awards and Reddit gold and you would think it’s enough. But the ads are obtrusive and the app tracks everything you do in a way that doesn’t make sense. 

Then, when you think that Reddit can’t do anything worse, they increase the price of their API so much, that it literally makes it impossible for third party applications to survive. Why? Because they know that this app is inferior to the others and this is an easy way to kill those apps while also making more money. 

And with all of that, you can just look at how this app is laid out. The UI/UX of this app is just bad, and that’s coming from a professional UI/UX designer.

Sometimes the app just restarts when I switch to another app while writing a comment or post, and it deletes whatever I’ve written when it does so. Even if I switch to one other app for less than a minute, the reddit app will restart and there’s no autosave function.

Some interactions use a side swipe, others vertical, and it makes no sense. 

Sometimes chats just don’t sent. Sometimes chats just don’t show up. It’s incredibly weird. 

Navigating the mod tools and controls in the app is a nightmare. So many functions are hidden behind different screens, like why can’t I edit the subreddit rules on mobile?

If I click too soon on a new notification, the relevant comment just won’t appear. I have to back out of the comment, wait a few seconds, reload the notification, then click for it to load. 

Some subreddits require flair. For some reason, i have to select the flair, go back to editing the post, click “finalize” again, and then submit my post for it to go through with flair.

When in this loading mode the app is non-responsive.  It is frustrating when this happens and degrades the experience.

The layout has changed requiring 2 extra taps to go to from on subreddit to another.   I don’t get ui designers and this theme….my app ui designers did the same…. Economy of taps people….  I don’t want to go to ‘home’ , tap hamburger then tap the desired subreddit.   I guess they want to push other content maybe?  

Another aspect is the swipe navigation.  When in a subreddit some time I end up at home due to a perceived swipe, maybe I did however I have no way to get back to where I was in that subreddit.  This stinks in very active subreddits (I generally browse by new not hot) and requires scrolling back down to get to where I was.

Hope the app devs are listening and the ui designers too.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-07T10:49:15-07:00

-have an idea if what sort of community/subject you’re interested in, as this site/app operates as a collection of groups called subreddits you can join and see posts from on a variety of topics

-like a less user-focused/anonymous type of social media. You still certainly have a lot of personal posts, and accounts, but unlike something like maybe instagram, less focus is put on individual timelines of most users. 

Regarding the app itself: it works. It’s pretty conveniently designed, especially since subreddits now give you steps with some directions if your posts need to adhere to some rules.

The mod took my post down for “asking how to identify drugs by look”, then when I messaged asking why, debates the validity of my personal story, demanded a drug report to confirm it was coke and not heroin, and was generally incredibly rude and obnoxious while refusing to answer why my post couldn’t be made and why they were being so rude about such a sensitive topic. Why does Reddit allow mods to be mini dictators with no possible way or reporting them when they violate their own sub rules and blatantly bully users/silence them?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-18T22:21:59-07:00

There's a sub for everything, I moderate a sub, I spend hours browsing. But every other day or so it decides to not work, and all I get is a ""sorry, try again later"" message and nothing loads. So nearly half of the time, the app is completely unusable.

The other thing is that in the last year the amount of censorship on Reddit has skyrocketed. While they've made some progress in cracking down on racists and Neo-Nazis, they take two steps in the opposite direction by censoring stories about the Chinese government. Some of this could come down to the fact that hundreds of subs are run with an iron fist by a total of 12 moderators.

Until they sort out the technical issues plaguing their mobile app and fix their broken moderation system to allow more people to participate in running the content, 3 stars is all they get from me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-10T09:14:34-07:00
