The only way you can get ‚Äúrid‚Äù of the account is just to log out and hope that you don‚Äôt remember your username and password. I wish they would make it easier for me just to delete my account easily without having to go through step-by-step.  

With that said, if you must use Reddit, use it with caution. It‚Äôs a democratic site and I‚Äôm Republican. you will get banned very easily for triggering someone who has a different opinion than you and will refuse to take your opinion to heart. My advice: there are far better apps to use that are not as toxic, DONT USE REDDIT",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-07T04:17:59-07:00
