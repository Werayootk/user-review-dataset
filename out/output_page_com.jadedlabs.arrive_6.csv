The stitching seems strong and the fabric seems very durable and should last longer than most . I will be buying a rain proof back pack cover . Nice product. Yes I’d buy again . Plus I’m fussy when it comes to comfort and size of my pack . These actually fit great . They don’t hang down on your but . They are perfect height just above the belt line . Mt.

So they’re showing as not delivered, but asking me to rate them. The most recent order I placed yesterday, on February 7th. Company shows as being based in same State as me so shouldn’t take too long? Only thing app showed me was estimated delivery date of September 1st for a few seconds then it went away and I can’t pull up estimated delivery date anywhere. Maybe some kind of a bug? Plenty of other companies have tracking numbers emailed, or at least send an email saying something like shipping label created, order not yet shipped.

One was there for over SIX HOURS because I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY NOTIFICATION that the very expensive package was delivered without ANY ALERT WHATSOEVER. 
Is it not the job of the delivery person to , as a courtesy and responsibility, to knock and notify the customer that package is on the premises ⁉️ Is it not just being professional and considerate to do as little as ring the doorbell ⁉️ 
I have THE RING and it didn’t detect the delivery because the driver barely came with in range of the RING security video. 
As stated above, this is the sixth, possibly the seventh time this has happened. 
In addition, drivers not wearing masks. 
PLEASE address these issues with your delivery people. Vast number of thinks are occurring and I feel blessed that I was not victimized by others who have no social moral compass. 
The drivers, however, have an absolute responsibility to do their jobs and follow DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS THAT I PURPOSELY ADD IN DELIVERY COMMENTS. 
Thank you for your time and consideration. 
It is not lost on me that you are all under tremendous pressure and stress but being conscious of how you deliver orders will in the long run save money, time, energy and any hassles that customers may incur as a result of a driver putting 3 extra minutes of work in.

A number of improvements could be made:
1)  Revert back to the old Home page.
2) Revert back to actual dark mode (black)

The autofill feature in web browsers has been doing this just fine for a decade. Package logistics for the company? None whatsoever. Shop doesn’t actually DO anything for anyone involved in the transaction. 

As an app, Shop is even more useless than the company that made it. Does it provide tracking information like a tracking number? No. Does it even tell you the shipping carrier? No. The date your package shipped? No. Expected arrive date? No. Does the shop app ask for all sorts of permissions to get into your email and track browsing activity as soon as you open it up? 100% yes. 

The reviews for this app are way too high. Look around at other app stores with Shop and you’ll see the real reviews: all one star. All saying the same thing.  Shop must have paid for all these random 5 star reviews. 5 stars? Definitely not for crapware like this.

Shop does not offer anything helpful, new or different. Somehow they smooth-talked some small businesses into using them and now we all gotta suffer.

If I waited until the app notified me about my deliveries, they would all have been stolen. It also has a problem with recognizing DHL tracking.

The app actually still shows the shipment as “Out for Delivery.” A lot of times, my shipments can be as much as a day off and out of sync with the app. Also, as much as I’m for helping the environment with common sense solutions, the Shop app came on really strong trying to sell the concepts of carbon of-setting while bloating a once great/simple shipment tracking app with a shopping app and overly aggressive info about their supposed concern for the environment.
