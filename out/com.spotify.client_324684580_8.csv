Spotify also took down one of my favorite podcasts with no warning and wouldn‚Äôt tell them why until a bunch of angry people started calling them out on social media. Then the podcast was put back up, and they were never told why it was taken down. A multi-year catalog of episodes was gone and they never accepted responsibility. Some episodes are still missing, but no copyright issue was ever revealed or any other answer. 

Very disappointing how they also keep rearranging the Home Screen, changing the way the queues work, etc.
