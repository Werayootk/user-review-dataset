I figured this out when me and a friend was playing together. When I broke the balls what happened on my table is not what happened on their table then it would flip to what was on his table. Next, you need to figure out a way to stop people from potting the cue ball at the end to avoid losing a game. I feel like there should be some kind of way that if you do such a thing you automatically lose. The ratio between win and loss between friends are never correct. This game needs fixed.

Second, when I took a shot with the clock ticking. The game accepted my shot, then it took it back! And, went on with next player. Third. I purchased a cue stick. But, this cue stick needs recharging like after 6 games! Why? Should I have to recharge my cue all the time? Its 400 tokens every time I charge! Each game should be call your pocket!

I bought the pool pass deal because it's a fun little side quest to keep you interested with challenges and rewards. Problem being a lot of the paid rewards don't open so I never end up getting them. Any of the pro/elite boxes that I'm supposed to be getting as prizes shake like they usually do when you open them.... But then nothing happens and they're marked as 'collected' without antiquity giving you any. Really annoying to spend money on something and not get what you paid for... And then to have no answer from their support crew when you email them about it. Hoping they monitor their reviews and fix this. I saw another review mentioning purchasing coins and how they get ranked against people 2x their level constantly and do nothing but lose.... I've also had this problem.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-20T05:49:32-07:00

I would watch the ball bounce out of the hole, the cue ball would pot at almost every turn, and when I thought I was about to win and would shoot for the 8 ball, the cue ball would pot and I would lose. I feel they do this on purpose to get you to buy the coins.  I will never purchase anything from any game ever. It was so aggravating watching my coins go from almost 50,000 to 0!

As you level up, more expensive matches/tournaments are available and you have to scroll through matches to select the one you choose.  If you touch the wrong one, you are entered into it whether you want to be there or not.  The coders were smart enough to not let you enter a tournament where you don‚Äôt have enough coins, but clever enough to not allow you to verify if you selected the correct match so you can erroneously be entered a match against players 20-30 levels higher than you.  That way, you lose all your coins and have to wait to purchase more.

I contacted Miniclip, and they said they don‚Äôt refund coins and to lock my screen.  Now how can you lock the screen and select a match at the same time?  If they don‚Äôt refund coins for a game error/glitch, you should never spend real money.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-13T12:31:15-07:00

Update: Since I upgraded my ipod air to latest IOS, your game is almost unusable, crashes all the time when I scroll right or left to access other 8 ball screens. Hey geniuses, did you know apple uses right or left swipes for other functions? SMH

PREVIOUS:

Great game, but I wish the game played more like real. Your version of english does not follow physics. If you are a free loader like me (never spends a dime) AND you are good (above 60%) you program the algorithm to make you scratch. So not only do you have to play against the opponent, you have to play against miniclip. If there was a better game, I‚Äôd buy it. 

Also I would pay for an option that lets me watch the other matches while waiting for mine. I would get to see how the opponent plays and possibly change my strategy.

Wouldn‚Äôt it would be nice to hit a button and the game sends the last shot to facebook or save it some other way? You would get a lot more people posting on social media.

I would pay for a premium version with good features. I can beat anyone with your basic stick, so your fancy sticks really don‚Äôt float my boat.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-03T05:07:07-07:00

The biggest complaint I have is the cost of cues and the little amount of pool cash you get when leveling up. It would take years to earn the cues without spending actual dollars which I have done but that is beside the point. I'd be more apt to spend real money if it were easier to earn money.

I‚Äôve been playing for almost a month, and currently, I‚Äôm a level 26 in the platinum league. It‚Äôs an amazing game, and I‚Äôve spent a few dollars for the piggy bank. However, there‚Äôs been a few flaws I‚Äôve encountered.

I played a few games in Las Vegas, which is 20k, and noticed for 3 or 4 games, there were two 8 balls! One of them were odd, however, because the person I was playing against accidentally sunk one, yet it did nothing. I haven‚Äôt had this issue ever since but it definitely was really confusing.

Next, I would like to talk about how rigged the Spin-to-wins and the Scratchers are. You have an ability to win so much money on both, yet every time I do them, I win such little money. I‚Äôve also asked my friends and family that play this game, and they have the same report. They never win anything good, even if you spend real money on it.

Next issue, is that every day, I get numerous pop ups saying that my friends are online, or that they were online recently. It‚Äôll ask me if I want to challenge them, and when I press later, it still challenges them after I declined.

Also, I would like to see the push-out option in 9-ball because that is how the game should be played, and it‚Äôs pretty unlucky if my opponent breaks dry but the cue ball is left in a position that is an impossible kick to hit the 1-Ball. My last suggestion is the three-foul-rule in 9-ball. Another thing that gets on my nerves is when a player keeps purposely fouling because I can do nothing with ball-in-hand. In 9-ball rules there is a three-foul-rule protecting that strategy.

on the break - I never pot a ball ... ever ... and half the time the cue ball scratches.

If I get a shot on my turn ... and if it is not completely blocked ... I will scratch no matter how or where I hit it. 

The quote, unquote opponent I play never scratches and is never blocked. 

They used to do their normal cheats ... like everyone goes thru when u don‚Äôt pay any money for ridiculous things ... like losing the connection right when ur about to win, but now I have achieved the highest honor anyone can be bestowed in mini clip 8ball pool ... the complete lock down cheat!!!
