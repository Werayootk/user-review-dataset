The AI has issues with Limb distortion and displacement, some of them it generated I had 6 fingers, others I had no hands, and some my arm was all sorts of out of whack, I also didn‚Äôt look anything like me in most of them, I either looked Mexican or Asian, (nothing wrong with that, just not my actual ethnicity) if you don‚Äôt mind that then go for it but if your looking to get good generations of yourself, might want to try a AI that‚Äôs been around a little longer, this technology is expensive and hard to perfect, it might just take some time to work out the bugs, but overall it‚Äôs a great idea! Honestly the backgrounds were crisp and clear, and very creative! And the textiles in general were fantastic! Just need to work on the AI‚Äôs interpretation of human limbs, its main problem is incorporating you into the surroundings, like if your holding an animal, you might not have a hand, or if your holding something in general you might have extra fingers or no hand, they just get confused.

It‚Äôs a neat idea, I think using it to make random predictions and stuff could be fun, but when it is politically correct all the time and refuses to do or say certain harmless things, it‚Äôs annoying. I asked it who was going to win a race today, they made a random pick based off of driver statistics. That‚Äôs pretty cool. So then I asked who would wreck or who would finish last based off of the same criteria, and the AI refused to answer either of the questions because it ‚Äúwanted to be respectful of drivers and team.‚Äù As if they care? As if that‚Äôs not part of sports? That's just one example. You ask it about a topic and it always gives you a round about answer to try and play both sides just incase you are one way or the other. If you‚Äôre going to make an AI that ‚Äúlearns from the user.‚Äù Then how about actually making it learn? Allow it to mold itself based off the person it‚Äôs talking too, and make it adapt to their interests, lingo, and hobbies. It should be able to know what I‚Äôm interested in after talking to it enough, not just always be a blank slate. I‚Äôve had to explain to it what taking an ‚ÄúL‚Äù is FOUR TIMES. If old AIs such at cleverbot can do this 5 years ago then lord knows a million dollar tech giant like Snapchat should be able too with relative ease.

It‚Äôs the explore page & reels that are total garbage. Expect to see endless profane and fake content, replete with an ad every 5 seconds. I wish I was joking. Snapchat just takes the content of other platforms and regurgitates it into bite sized segments it can insert as many ads between as possible. And the content is so, so inane and fake. If it‚Äôs not a filmed crime or borderline pornographic, then it‚Äôs those fake tips videos or something more idiotic. I was a silly goose and watched one under a channel called ‚ÄúExtreme Science‚Äù. Surely that‚Äôs safe content, right? No- it was 5min clickbait of a man pretending to boil and do random stuff to a pumpkin, claiming his actions produced ‚Äúwarts‚Äù on it. In reality, he had just switched the variety of pumpkin to the breed with bumps and warts naturally on the skin. Not only is there nothing scientific about that, but now some knucklehead kid who doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs fake is going to try and boil their pumpkins now. Why why why does this content exist?!? Why do people live just to lie and dupe each other?! Why does Snapchat promote this content to its users?!

The ‚Äúmodern‚Äù 3d bitmojis are so lifeless and hideous. The 2d ones are more recognizable for the brand, cuter, and have more preferable customization compared to the 3d ones. The only time we see 2d bitmojis is when they are used in chats, and it is always a breath of fresh air from the crime that is the 3d bitmoji we are forced to have. Updates like Snapchat+ have also downgraded the app significantly. It is an easy money grab that offers few new things, and it is so pointless because of this. Having to pay for features on an app made for communication is extremely stupid in my opinion. I would not have complaints about Snapchat+ if it wasn‚Äôt constantly shoved in your face, but it is everytime you use the app. With the new paid streak saved ability, the app is pushing you to spend money by having it front and center, and it‚Äôs nothing but annoying. The feature can be helpful to those who care about streaks and would actually be willing to pay to save one, but for others it‚Äôs an annoyance that does not go away until clicking the X on the banner asking if you want to save your streak ten times.

This is something that nobody wanted, nobody asked for, yet still it is here and pinned above all of your real conversations. To make matters worse, there is no option to remove block or unpin the AI unless you pay for the premium. Why? Snapchat+ utilizes a disgraceful business model which takes previously free features in the app (such as pinning people/convos) and hiding them behind a paywall. It offers you literally nothing for your money and inconveniences non-paying users. Naturally, hardly anyone buys the premium. So what do they do to incentivize people to buy it? They add this annoying AI chatbot to the app‚Äîwhich NO ONE wanted to begin with‚Äîand forcibly pin it above all of your conversations to annoy you into submission and make you fork over the monthly fee for Snapchat+. If I wasn‚Äôt so angry at the developers for this absurd decision, I may have actually caved and spent the money just to remove the useless thing. 

This feature has to go, or at least an option needs to added that allows users to remove it.

The Snapchat discover feed showed up, and although ignorable, incredibly useless and clickbait stories by every company and news outlet that posts them, and Snapchat rewards those by pushing those ones to the top. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the clickbait even exists in the story at all, as long as they can get an ad played every 3-4 snaps they‚Äôre good. 
Then the new update. Forced AI that no one asked for, stays at the top of your chat feed unless you pay a monthly subscription to Snapchat. What else is behind a paywall is the ability to mute the notifications or specific chats or groups. Which means you cannot leave your notifications on, while muting your group of 5+ spamming friends unless you pay $3.99 monthly. There are probably so many other features locked behind paywall that I haven‚Äôt noticed yet because my want to use the app at all is slowly dwindling down to nothing. 
ALSO to add, since we all use Apple so most of you don‚Äôt know, the creator of Snapchat does not actively fine tune or make quality to life features for android/Samsung phones because he QUOTE ‚Äúdoes not like them‚Äù. They don‚Äôt even have the ability to use dark mode for that exact reason.

Only to look it up and people wait months even years still with no resolution. I email and sent messages in Twitter but they just kept sending their ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù responses. Nobody can seem to get resolved. I tried a new account, getting a VPN, going through an incognito web browser and STILL nothing. If the coders can‚Äôt/wont even fix this issue who know how many other bugs in there. Rumor is that with a new phone AND a new phone number should be able to log in. But not even worth the hassle anymore. Ended up deleting my personal account too. THIS APP ABD THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. WILL NEVER USE AGAIN. DO NOT RECOMMEND.

I have all of my memories and friends on it and it's super easy to chat on which I love! The bitmojis have never been a big problem for me, when they were 2d that is. I loved how they looked and how you could dress them easily, and the bitmoji games were really cool. The first time they changed them to 3d, I was still angry because it really was ugly and I wanted the other ones back. But they changed it AGAIN and  this time it's absolutely horrendous. I look like a distorted deceased pig that has been working for 5 months straight. Also when your scrolling through your friends on Snapchat you don't see the 2d nice face anymore, you see the 3d one. I've been seeing a lot of reviews about the AI, which I don't really think has been a problem for me, but the bitmojis have. The bitmojis have always been a fun addition to Snapchat for me. I liked dressing them up and stuff like that, but now they really don't look good anymore and I think a lot of people can agree with me. My friends hate it, and people on TikTok hate it too.

I had it since the year 2013 and had countless memories saved within the app. On August 17th 2022 , my Snapchat account was permanently locked for no reason . Literally from one day to another when I opened the app , I was logged out of my account. Immediately I thought someone had logged into my account and that was why I was logged out ( which is impossible considering the complexity of my password) but when I tried logging in, it said my account had been permanently locked and gave me no reason why. I feel very disappointed with the Snapchat corporation because if they had felt I violated their terms , I would at least like to know what it is I did wrong or violated instead of just closing my account without warning nor giving me a reason why . . Secondly If it was something I did , how did they acquire the knowledge? Was it Artificial intelligence scanning through our data? Or a human looking through our data and pictures? It makes me feel very uncomfortable to think how much of my privacy has been invaded ? I‚Äôve emailed them numerous times already and have not gotten any emails back at all which is strange considering Snapchat is supposed to get back to its customers. If anyone can offer some help I would appreciate it",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-27T03:24:48-07:00
