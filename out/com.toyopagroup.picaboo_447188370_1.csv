11112104419,Smoke bee,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1600842289,12.80.0.35,3,So… umm… one little detail…,"So… the game/app is so fun no doubt but…it is a bad game/app let me explain… there are little kids on this game/app. They could easily get kidnapped. Bc there are bad people on this game who usually use it to find kids and kidnap them. But…….. it’s unlikely for people to do that. There are three reasons. 1. They will most likely be caught by the police. 2. We aren’t stupid (like my siblings) 3. it is stupid. So that is why I give this a three star review. Plz don’t get mad I’m just trying to keep the children out of their safe (even though I will be fine) so stay safe out their children you never know (don’t be like my siblings) btw l am a fan of warrior cats. So… I have seen a lot of warrior cat fans doing this, so I’m gonna do it too.
