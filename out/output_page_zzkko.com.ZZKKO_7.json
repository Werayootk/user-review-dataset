Shipping (to U.S.) does take forever so if you are ordering for a specific occasion definitely order a few weeks ahead of time and don't always expect for it to be exactly what you imagined it would be. So if your ordering like a dress for a wedding or something and you get it just in the nick of time I'd definitely have s back up outfit plan just in case it doesn't fit or look like in the picture. I like that you can get points for reviewing and uploading pictures of their clothes and use those towards future purchases.

There are almost always coupon codes that you can use to save money and on top of that you can earn points and use that towards your purchase! One thing I will say is ALWAYS read the reviews because they will often include pictures of everyday people wearing the clothes and on top of that they often list their size and measurements so you will know how it fits and if you should size up or down. Only annoyance is that every time I open the app I have to wait like 15 seconds for an ad to be over before I can actually use the app and it gets kind of annoying.

I am a size small in most tops, usually a medium (4-6) in bottoms. I almost always order one size up on each. I’ve probably made about 8 shipments at this point from them, and I’ve found something to be unwearable only when I’ve gotten the wrong size maybe twice. There are VERY few things I didn’t like on me, or things that were too small that I either returned (easy) or gave to a friend. You get what you pay for.

Also, check the reviews ofc, to see what other people say. Sometimes it runs large, small, etc. Sometimes it’s a little thinner or more cropped than expected. They have a size thing that you can do (if you can’t find it on the app just look it up) and it will show you your likely sizes based on your measurements and your size compared to other brands.

I couldn’t say enough good things about this website  I literally tell everyone bc I’m constantly being asked,”where did you get that cute outfit, SHEIN girl.”  Literally She In!!   love this company and is the only place I shop now for almost everything.  This app helped me feel pretty in clothes again I was wearing nothing but black.  Black leggings, tank top and sweater.  I hated it but didn’t feel comfortable in anything  I have recently put on some weight.  SHEIN helps me feel beautiful again and not in all black. Thank you SHEIN you have a customer for life here.

Little girls should not be wearing plunge swimsuits 😒 Now some of their clothing is cute! They have plenty of cute vintage basics that are under 10 bucks. I just don’t love some of their other pieces. My favorite thing about SHEIN is their accessories. Jaw clips, bucket hats, anti blue light glasses, and jewelry all usually under 10 bucks! I can’t get enough of them! The app also works really well, you can get points pretty easy and use them to take a couple bucks off your order. You can also enter into competitions and make outfits.

This is a Chinese wholesale website however the clothing is very well made. The sizing is set up for US sizes so you don’t have to worry about something being too small. Furthermore, if someone does run small, the reviews will tell you and there’s a chart that says it runs small. Shein motivates customers to write detailed reviews in exchange for points that can be used as discounts. Similarly, the clothing items are SOO unique and cuter than anything else I would find in a local store. The shipping takes a little long but then again, if I don’t have to pay for shipping then I don’t mind. If you want quicker shipping, choose express (beggars can’t be choosers).

I like how the app gives related items after you put something on your wishlist or in your cart so you can really go down a rabbit hole.

I’m usually very picky about fabric quality, but just by seeing pictures of some of the items you can tell what they’ll be like irl. For me, the biggest plus is that they have very ample size selections in all styles. I think SHEIN is one of the best options for plus size clothing, and styles are either the same as those offered for standard sizes or completely unique pieces. \n\nI have had to return a few items because I didn’t like the fabric quality, but I haven’t had a single item look different than the pictures in the app of what I ordered. Jeans on this site are AMAZING, thick denim with quality stitching. I also love the dresses and jackets. Like I said, I can pick out quality a bit easily since I’m familiar with fabric and know what I’ll look like, so I def see some items on the site that would not fit my quality standards. Also, user reviews are critical in choosing items, since they give insight as to sizing, fit, quality and overall style. \n\nSHEIN has become my main source of clothing, and will continue to be in the foreseeable future.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-01-12T06:17:47-07:00"},{"id":"6977083930","userName":"Gretch702","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id442273691","version":"7.4.7","score":1,"title":"Truly one (1) star service!","text":"Customer service is absolutely absent!

I ordered it and tracked the package, a week later I got an email saying that the sweater had been sold out after I had already bought it! Why didn’t it just mark the sweater sold out before? How did it sell out after I made the purchase and why did it take so long to tell me? Shein offered to give me fifty shein points and a refund which was nice except that I spent over 200 shein points on that sweater and a coupon. That’s not really anything to complain about but the thing that bothers me the most was how they didn’t tell me until a week after I had bought the sweater.

A lot of the coupons don’t ever work even if it’s ones that are allowed with your item. the products are normally good for but the service is a little iffy sometimes i wonder if it would be quicker and easier to buy things from other websites after trying to contact customer service all i got was an email in like chinese that didn’t answer my question in the slightest it should me my order and that it was out for delivery but it has said that sense the 11th and todays the 15th but still no package","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-15T09:58:35-07:00"},{"id":"9908608202","userName":"therealfebeauty","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id666333227","version":"9.1.8","score":5,"title":"Just read","text":"So I’m a big thrift shop person I like old clothes from time to time I’ll go to Zara and H&m my friend always had cute tops and bags so she always told me Shein have good stuff to check it out never listened to her cuz I really hate online shopping one day out of curiosity I just ordered some super cute bathing suits off Shein and boy oh boy I kept going they give you discounts daily if you read the size chart you’ll never get something too small pay attention to the sizing fast shipping I even had issues where my package was stolen and they re shipped the items out it’s legit and the quality is good I mean the jewelry is 1 dollar and Zara and all these places selling the same stuff for 20 dollars if my review is not enough then you’re going to miss out I haven’t thrifted in a while Shein did that","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-09T04:34:13-07:00"},{"id":"9132403558","userName":"ILoVeShein !!!!!!!!!!!!","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1396183684","version":"8.5.6","score":5,"title":"I wish I could have the SHEIN app as my personal closet!!!","text":"I love SHEIN I wish I could getLiterally everything.

First time since being a customer they decided to switch shipping vendors and my items came in 3 packages. Received the first which was small my jacket in my mailbox. The second said it was signed but never delivered so I began a dispute. They refunded me for two dresses and then the same happened with the 3rd which had 3 more dresses. Went to dispute those items never received and they said they would check with the shipping distributor and but emailed me saying it was delivered… how?????? I didn’t even get the second package how did the 3rd deliver? I requested they resend the items over a refund since those dresses for for work.  They stopped responding to my inquiry and I’m even more frustrated about that. I’m deleting the app and will shop online elsewhere going forward. I also plan to make a report to the BBB because I see this is the same issues other customers are having.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-03T15:33:29-07:00"},{"id":"8069480137","userName":"1Queenie Banks","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id335888870","version":"7.9.0","score":4,"title":"Love It Here!  I gave you 4.3 star rating","text":"I absolutely love their kids clothing and prices . Everything I’ve ordered thus far has been just as described on the site. The plus clothing are very fashionable and accurate to size. And I really love that there are colors and prints of many different choice in the plus sizes. The ordering process is simple and easy to maneuver through. If I had to say anything negative at all it would only be about the way several packages are stuffed in a box all together and that some of the wall decor and jewelry got bent/damaged during the delivery process. But even those things were minor and easy to repair. Overall I’m totally obsessed with this store and have and will continue to shop here for as long as I can afford to. P.S. The coupons are insane savings on already low affordable priced  products . Thanks SHEIN I absolutely LOVE IT HERE!!!!!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-11-27T08:05:57-07:00"}]
