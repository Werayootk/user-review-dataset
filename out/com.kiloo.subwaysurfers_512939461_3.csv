When it gives you the option to travel to super runner city to get some super runner, it tells you the current super runner that you can get. Currently, it’s Fresh. Sometimes, though, it appears as super runner Jake. Every time I close out of the application, it resets to either Jake or Fresh. It’s really annoying, especially because I’ve been working on getting either for a while and it always ends up resetting my score and the super runner anyway. It ruins the game for me to be honest, because I mostly play for the super runner challenges, and with the constant resetting of my score and the super runner, it all makes no difference. I really hope it isn’t a purposeful bug on the developer’s part in order to get more plays of their game, but whatever it is, I kindly ask for it to be fixed.

6703515337,Matylda Burke,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1149350904,2.9.2,5,This is a great game!,"Hello! I have been playing Subway Surfers for over a year now and it is a great way to pass time. I especially like that you can play it without WiFi or cellular. When I first downloaded the game I thought I would NEVER get some of the characters because I thought they costed so many coins or keys. The thing is I own most of those characters now because I got the Jackpot twice. I mean I though I would never get the Jackpot because I mean once in a million right? But boy was I wrong I got it twice which was amazing. I also love all the different characters they add. I especially like that there from a lot of different ethnic backgrounds. 

I just have a few requests and must do’s if you get the game. 
First off can you please make more of the characters worth coins instead of money? It would be really helpful, I don’t care how many coins or keys just try to make it so we don’t have to buy them. 
Second of all, what does the 2x multiplier even do? It doesn’t double your coins that’s for sure. 

Must do’s of your gonna download the game. 
Watch the daily key video! For that you get keys which help you get characters and saves and you get achievements the more times you watch it. 
Another must do is, buy all the characters and board even if you don’t like them. You get achievements for them! 

That’s all I have for today! This game is great and I completely recommend everyone gets it. 

Have a great day!

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me. Whatever.  I play it enough I would probably pay it.  But don’t give me the run around and nickel and dime me.  You could spend $100 dollars on this game and NOT UNLOCK EVERYTHING.  are you kidding me?     Change the incentive structure and cost of everything ASAP.  Either offer more coins or lower the prices of the items to get.  I bought the double coins feature.  Still takes a week of playing to buy 1 board.  Then you want to talk about keys?    No way you can earn all the keys and coins possible to buy everything in the game in any type of reasonable time.

The adds are decent so not like a add after every round like some games you only have adds when you choose to, I think it would be great if the game has a choice where you could buy a boost think to give you a choice to do double jump not like the shoes tho where every jump in a double jump because I don’t like that personally so I think if we swipe up 2 time we will double jump but not when we just swipe once if you know what I mean? Also I’m not sure if I haven’t seen them yet or if it’s not a thing but what if the season tokens were also in the mystery boxes, but not like a common thing to happen just every once and a while 1 token. Anywho that’s all I have for now overall the best game ever there’s a lot of characters you always have quests to beat and people to put score and events to participate in!

What it does is when you buy it you get a option at the top of the screen when you start running in the game. Here’s an example, when you start running the magnet will stay on top of my screen until I lose the game, and when your running you can use the mega magnet and what it does is gets all the coins like from the beginning when you started running. 

Idea 2 y’all should make an update where you can add levels, and like instead of just the trains and stuff you can add like different places too when you level up. Like a space place, a candy place, a lava place, a ice place, and a kingdom.

The nostalgia factor from playing this in my childhood, along with the novelty of having a new update every few months with the World Tour, the developers are doing a great job keeping Subway Surfers in the public eye. The scenery changes with every update, while controls and artstyle are familiar and unchanging. I’m also a huge fan of the new fan made characters. It keeps the art side of the community engaged and the other sides excited for the new and interesting characters.
I love the new Mexico update for the World Tour, mostly because everything is purple and that’s my favorite color. But also because the scenery around the train tracks is beautiful, more so than any recent updates, in my opinion. The neon skulls on the inside of the tunnels is one of my favorite parts.
Overall, solid game. It’s easy to pick up, especially for people who played it as a kid, and the frequent updates keep things shaken up in a very good way.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-16T11:41:25-07:00

It’s like you’re begging for money which makes the whole game seem like a huge advertisement. Another problem I have with is with the whole “subway surfers” theme. Every download the only thing that changes are a new map, which is basically the same layout as every other map, and an overpriced character. Maybe you can add some more interesting updates like a railway crossing with another train intersecting like a cross and the player has to jump through a hole in one of the cars. Or maybe a car crossroad where the cars are driving over the track and the player has to jump on the cars. How about a more interesting above-ground section when you use the jetpack so you can dodge different objects such as trees and parked bicycles. This game has major potential, and even though it has been out for quite a while, not many things about the maps and overall layout changed, which is very disappointing.

Stars.,"So subway surfers is a game that you can play at any moment or time, on any type of phone. It’s a game with a running character  that you can change by buying new “skins” with coins you get in the game by playing and collecting. But there is more to the game then just that. For example, you can try to get new “high scores” with your character, and on the way you can collect as well as coins, also mystery boxes and keys, witch you can also use to unlock things like characters, or boxes. The further you get in the game, the more advanced you and your score get. Also the more you run, the faster it all gets. It is an enjoyable game, and it might seem like subway surfers should get 5 stars, but sometimes it gets frustrating as well as glitchy. It can glitch every now and then and the controls are not the best. Sometimes the set up of the game is not great and while you are running it looks like all the little things like trains and obstacles are the same and very repeated.

Long review short - Thank you for adding cloud sync and save to Subway Surfers. I’ve missed it so much but was always hesitant to start over and not wanting to re purchase everything in the event of another device issue or app issue.

If you want to get something, or double up something, you can just watch a a short add. There are also Pop Up adds which are much better than killing videos between each game. This game is awesome with being precise on which way you want to go. I also love that it actually takes you to real places in the world. And right now, it’s Moscow Russia!

There are a lot of reviews saying that the most major update killed the game, but to me it’s actually not a bad update, with new locations to run through, and some new collectibles and prizes. 
 The reason that I’m giving this game a three star is because of a couple of reasons. One of which is the music, because when I’m playing this game, one of the things that I’m wanting is that famous trademark beat that gives the game that kick that it used to, and I feel that some of the newer music doesn’t have that. 

Another reason this game is three stars is because  (and this is more of a personal thing) it’s very repetitive. You play about 3 times and then your done because it’s the same thing over and over and over again, and I know that that’s the appeal of a this game, but still.

I love how the course is always changing. There are no glitches nor is the add amount crazy. Some games have an add after every level, but subway surfers is the perfect amount(other than no adds). I like the variety of characters, outfits, and hoverboards. Sometimes they add in new limited time characters which are cool. The only thing is that some characters you have to get objects to unlock. (Stereos, hats, spaceships) And those objects are super hard to get. But, I love the missions and how you get keys once you complete the mission. I also like how they have a word and you have to get the letters during the run. I like the silver, bronze, gold, and diamond medals because you can challenge yourself to beat your high score or beat the person ahead of you.

Additionally, the characters are cute and easy to get! Many people complain that you have to pay for a lot of them, but that only applies to a handful of characters. Lastly, the new mini games are great for when I get sick of the main thing, and I like how they add more constantly.

The only issue I have is with the Top Run bots. Their scores go up to insane levels, so it’s impossible to beat them! My brother once spent over an hour getting to “Champion” on the last day of the event, but when he went back into the app the next day to collect his prize, a bot had beat him down to “diamond”. He was incredibly disappointed. These bots’ scores are getting into the 8-10 million range, which is just impossible to beat. It ruins the fun of actually trying to get to the top of the Top Run rankings. If it weren’t for this, I would’ve given it 5/5 stars because it’s mostly an excellent game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-03T06:17:42-07:00

I lost everything I had worked for over the course of a couple of years. I lost my high score (which was 2.M) and I lost all my keys, characters, coins, and everything I had.

After several years (2-3) of playing I had to stop. I don’t entirely know how to phrase this but here it goes: due to its simplistic nature (I assume) I would “see “ the game and be “playing” it without a device with my eyes closed? I  didn’t play it that often but I had to stop around two years later because this started to happen and when you have school the next day and have the game “playing” in your mind it makes falling asleep very difficult as it always happened when laying in bed. After a few years away from the game (1-3?) I tried coming back and was met with same results after two weeks. Now it’s been several years since I’ve played. I haven’t heard anyone else mention things like this so maybe it just me. This game is very fun and I’m still tempted to play it.

First, can you cut down on the ads? They are moderate and all, but they can still be annoying when you just click to go to the menu or something and then a ad pops up for no reason. Second, I wish you didn’t make stuff in the game so expensive with game currency or real currency. (I’m not trying to be rude.) Last, there is a glitch where when I pause the game, leave the app, or close it out, when I reopen the app it gives me like 3 ads and my progress isn’t saved. Another similar glitch is when I click the ‘ad for revival’ or ‘ad for free stuff’ it gives me an ad, when I close it out the app crashes, and when I open it up again it gives me ANOTHER ad, and even worse, I don’t get the original prize!

There are obstacles that can stop you from winning. The goal is to run from the cop (Who has a helper dog) and collect coins on the way to the end.

1 if you want festive or elf characters you can either spend money or get an in game currency and in previous updates you only had one or two characters to unlock with the in game currency about 30,000 each but now there’s like five with 25,000 each so you need more of the currency but you earn about the same amount so I don’t know how to get them all

2 just a small issue here, a one of the seasonal quests is to use 100 hoverboards and I had 300 then in the last update I had to use 100 and same in this one so if the seasonal quests could be a little bit less ambitious that would be pleasing

3 every now and then an update would have like a thing like tag team time event or marathon or super runner city that you would do to get a character (it’s usually there either way but you wouldn’t get a character from it) and this update there’s 2 characters to unlock and one of them I need to wait 20 hours to go on to the next stage and I again think it’s a little too ambitious for us to have to play for this long (we’ll idk about other people but this was written by me with my opinion so… ) 

I think this update has too many things to do at least for the time we have and if in next updates it would be easier, thank you",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-20T16:12:50-07:00

And one of my favorite things about the game is the power ups that you would get while playing to make the game over all more fun and more addictive! One of my favorites used to be the super sneakers because you could jump over many obstacles in your way and just overall makes runs easier. Yet now it is the complete opposite... 
So the main problem here is that if you jump with these sneakers in an enclosed area in the Subway and when you jump, you hit the ceiling and you instantly get knocked down and the run ends. The super sneakers are now a power up that I try to avoid at all cost, because it makes the run just harder. If you try to jump over a moving train in an enclosed area with the power up you get crushed. Which is where I always used to use the sneakers. I hope you guys fix this issue, it is severely irritating.
Besides that keep doing what you guys do.

Characters and boards will come and go, but every single one will always eventually come back. Sometimes for money, and sometimes not. It may be months or even years, but always eventually. Plus, making all characters eventually obtainable like this is already extremely nice of the developers to do, and that’s something you don’t see in most other games. If they wanted to lock certain characters behind a paywall, they could. And they have every right to. But they don’t.

It was a new, cheap, dark, Samsung Tablet. It was cheap, but very easy to use. I remember purchasing many apps, one of which a newly upgraded game called “Subway Surf” at least that’s what I thought it was dubbed until my mother corrected me weeks after. Once my mother told me the what I thought was a complicated game actually went around as “Subway surfers” I found this a tongue twister.
“Subway suwfers” I would incorrectly call it.

    Subway Surfers is an outstanding app. It relieves my boredom and gives me something to do on those long days. I will always and forever love this game. From my perspective, the games quality and graphics are really good. The game doesn’t lag often for me, which is good! Also, the details on this game is really good and I can tell that the developer/s have taken many long minutes, hours, days, months to develop this fine game. If you haven’t already, you should download this app and see if it meets your expectations because it definitely met mine. 

   I rated this app a four for two main reasons. Firstly, in my opinion, I think when you first start running in the game is very slow. If it was a little faster then it would be better. Yes, even if your new to the game it might be harder to get used to it, but accelerating the speed a little won’t be much harder for new players. Also, many people will disagree with this opinion but I dislike the boots that make you jump higher. They mess me up when I'm jumping and when theres a tunnel and I jump over a red sign, I bump into it and it makes me restart or have to watch an ad or use a key to continue. The boots are better for getting coins, but they mess me up a lot. Otherwise I think the game is really fun and worth downloading.

Some characters cost a lot of coins and some exclusive characters cost money which isn’t the best but there are many other good characters you can get! Next is the missions they are pretty good and if you want to pass some time the missions are a great thing to work on especially to get your score multiplier higher. Next is the exclusive updates, they usually add some new characters and you can get many rewards such as coins,keys,mystery boxes, head starts, and score boosters. They also give a character. Next is that there’s not a million ads every 20 seconds! You barely get ads and if you do they let you exit it out in a few seconds.

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

I play this game a lot now and I enjoy it. I play with my friends and we compete. (I have the highest score out of all of them hehe) There’s a few things that they NEED to fix.

I noticed some glitches that can ruin gameplay if you’re not cautious. 
1. Bouncy Shoes
Sometimes when I have the bouncy shoes on, I can hit my head on top of the ceiling while I’m in a tunnel. This is really bad and they need to fix this! Very frustrating when you die because of a glitch.
2. Invisible roofs
This one is kinda hard to explain, when when I use the jetpacks or pogo sticks, after they run out I sometimes land on top of a tunnel (like the roof) they sometimes have coins and sometimes are empty. But in some cases you can go through them and they kill you because you can’t see and you can’t tell if the roof will be invisible or not.
3. Intense lag starting at a score of 2 million

This may just be my phone, but mine lags at 2 million. This happens to my friends too and one of them has an IPhone 11 Pro, which is a phone that can handle a lot of mobile games and never lag. Some say the new update was rushed and that caused the lag, but whatever it is it is very hard to get a score past 10 million with the crazy lag.

I didn't even love Timmy anyways, it was always you. Timmy bribed me. YOU are the real deal. Graduating high school with you was the best. Having sleepovers, going to parties, it was always better with you. I love you. But you don't slay anymore, not since you're ending the event early. Please, this isn't you. This isn't you. This isn't the Subway Surfers I know and love. Come back to me. Please. It's not too late. I will always love the true, NON-HOMOPHOBIC, Subway Surfers.

Love,

8830863205,CiciMack519,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id408696054,2.36.0,2,Fun game. Infuriating glitch!,"I love S.S. I played it as a kid and redownloaded it during the Las Vegas event. I’ve been having fun. UNTIL now!
I spent so much time to earn the supper runner version of Fresh and his board! I was 3 milestones away from earning his board and the game glitched out and DELETED ALL OF MY POINTS! It’s making me START OVER from the first level of the super runner challenge! WHERE DID MY POINTS GO?! It took FOREVER to earn those points! I watched a bunch of videos to stay alive and earn surfboards, spent keys to keep running, AND came back every 2 hours to play! MILLIONS of points- GONE! I’ve reset the game, I’ve reset my iPad, I’ve tried to re-update the app, and NOTHING has worked! How do I get my points back?! CAN I get them back?! Or am I totally screwed and have to start over?! Cuz it is ridiculous if there is no way to fix this! I had so many keys and GAVE THEM UP to earn the board and Fresh! I could’ve bought a limited time character or board with them! But I was more excited about the super runner stuff and my work just went down the drain! Someone please tell me how to fix this!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-01T15:22:35-07:00
8819777953,gymnastgal2008,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1074488933,2.36.0,4,It’s ok,"I love this game and it’s so fun but there are a few things I want to state. First, this game doesn't have too many glitches, but I’ve noticed when I’m Swiping right or left, sometimes it keeps me going straight and i get caught because I ran into something or got hit by a train. My next thing is the power up jump shoes. In my opinion these do not help AT ALL and just distract me. Also if there is a jump it could go ti far and I might run into something and have to start over again. One time I was at 50,00 and I accidentally got the jump shoes (I avoid them) and they messed me up and I had to start over even though I was doing so good. My most recent problem is when I hit the revive ad and watch it it starts me over and it’s really annoying. I was at 30,000 and swiped into a wall and died so I clicked the revive ad because I was doing so good. When I finished the ad it sent me to the “finished” page where it shows your score. Not very good subway surfers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-28T10:35:57-07:00
7540455815,Anonymous4736251,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1152566291,2.19.1,3,What’s with all the ads?,"I strongly believe that there are too many ads in your game it makes me want to stop playing it even though I’ve played it off and on since a year or two after it came out. There used to be less ads and they would only be when I redeem something like a free crate that you get for watching one but now I get an ad when I finish a match, exit the shop, enter the shop, go into or out of missions, if I stay on the Home Screen too long, when going out of character select, etc. Just about every time that I do something I get an ad and it really bugs me. Yes I know I could just play it offline but then I can’t get free revives when I’m setting a new high score or get double coins/tokens. I also know the ads help make you more revenue and stuff but please consider how annoying they are. I also know that most ads have a skip button and stuff but not all of them do and they feel like they take forever even though it’s only 30 seconds. Please understand this. Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-04T21:13:25-07:00
1841990587,JustAnotherPlayer123,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id623506013,1.77.1,1,So something horrible happened...,"Subway Surfer's concept is good, but I'm afraid that what happened to me will happen to someone else. So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048. Even if you restart the app, restart your phone, or your phone dies, your progress WOULD NEVER BE LOST!!! EVER! Why can Subway Surfers be like that? Thanks for hearing my words!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2017-10-11T09:57:23-07:00
