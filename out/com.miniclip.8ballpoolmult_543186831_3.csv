Their cue automatically lines up to hit 3 and 5 cushion shots each time to make the most ridiculous, impossible pots multiple times in a row. Not sure what the hackers get by winning fake coins with no $ value, but clearly gives them some pleasure. 

It’s just annoying and the game developers don’t seem to take any action or fix it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T12:24:17-07:00

The problem with this game, and it is a huge one, is that it is filled with Hackers, mostly on high bet tables. I’ve been playing this game for years and have billions in coins, so obviously I opt to play in the table with most money, and I’ve had days in which I play against many hackers, one day I matched up against 7 different ones in a row… it just gets to a point where it is too many too often and it seems like they don’t care at all.

If I want to play the 100 coin bets each game, it shouldn't restart and start at the game option where you can accidentally click on it and bet all your coins. Lastly, once you finish a game, there should always be a button to play a new game without having to verse the same person or leave out of the finished game screen to choose a new game.
