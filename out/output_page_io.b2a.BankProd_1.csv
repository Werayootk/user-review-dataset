I hate how overly complex most banking apps are - too much noise, notifications, etc. I know myself, for me, less is more when it comes to my finances. Monzo is simple. No fees, no hoopla. I love their salary sorter. I can quickly sort my money into Pots - it’s very set it and forget it. Monzo is my absolute favorite bank!

They also has great customer support. I don’t think I’ve ever had a positive online chat experience in my life, but their chat team was superb!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-19T10:41:40-07:00

Setting certain transactions as repeating payments is a very nice feature for subscriptions and under the “Payments” tab you can see these recurring payments. I like that you can add notes, tags and receipts to every transaction. The budgeting tool is not very helpful to me personally, but the Trends feature is - it helps to see how you’re using your money. The Pots have a “scheduled payments” option, but it should really say “scheduled transfers” because Pots are not for making payments - they are just to set money aside. To use money from Pots you have to transfer it back to main account. If I could make payments directly from a “Bills” Pot with its own account number then “scheduled payments” would make sense and would be a very useful feature. Spend (checking), Savings and Bills - if I had a separate account number for these three along with some cash back or rewards options on purchases, it would be the perfect banking app for me.

That’s where it all went downhill. Where most banks would have someone you could speak with quickly to update and re-send, they don’t have that option. You need to use the app’s chat function. It took 3 days for someone to respond to my initial message, but apparently the issue was too difficult for that agent, so they needed a “specialist” to get involved. More than two weeks later waiting for someone to get back to me and multiple “we’re so sorry, we guarantee a specialist will get back to you ASAP,” I asked them to close my account. They assured me again it would be resolved quickly, but there was nothing they could do in the meantime. After 3 weeks from my application, I received an email from someone called Eugene telling me that not only did they close my account, but I will never be allowed to open an account with them again?

I’ve been using Monzo for the past two months as my primary bank and not being able to use my budgeting app of choice is incredibly frustrating. What worse is that on Monzo’s development roadmap, Plaid support falls low on the list and it doesn’t seem to be a priority at all. Granted, Monzo has built in budgeting tools, but they pale in comparison to something like Copilot. So while I’m not going to close my account, I will switch back to my credit union in the mean time.

There are NO international MasterCard fees and they give you a reasonable exchange rate. When you pay, choose “USD” not the local currency and Monzo does the exchange. 

I love the fact it breaks down the purchases into categories. 

Also, Europe is notorious for ATM card skimming. By keeping a lower balance on my Monzo I limit my risk. I also use it instead of my regular bank card for cash withdrawals. 

I must say I like it and it’s practically the only card I use. Would love to see them do a Credit Card like Chime as you need a CC for many airlines and hotels
