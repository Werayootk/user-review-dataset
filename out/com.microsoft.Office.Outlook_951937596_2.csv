This app is never fixed. 
1. Sub folders under inbox do not sync to what is on O365 online. This makes it problematic looking for emails. 
2. The calendar does not update in realtime. It can take more than 24 hours to show correct data. This goes for outside calendars as well that are synced. 
3. There should be similar functionality as of the web and desktop version. 

Hopefully this is fixed soon. I hate uninstalling and reinstalling the app just to fix it. I’ve never seen a fix for this app. All updates always say bug fixes, but nothing has been fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-21T20:42:59-07:00
