The only time I can tell someone is calling is if I am already in the app and on a call. I’ve looked in all the settings, and there is only an option to add, remove or change sounds for messages, not for calls. When someone is calling me on voice or video, I expect my phone to ring.

Like many others have said, there are many issues with customer support. The first response to any query is automated and says to check the FAQs and reply if still not answered. The second response, if any, is unrelated to the query, and therefore as useless as the first response. The third response is nonexistent; WhatsApp support never sends more than one response after the automated message. It follows that you will never get an answer to your query nor any indication that your feedback or bug report will be forwarded to the appropriate team. In conclusion, WhatsApp customer support is completely useless and is just an extra cost for WhatsApp and hindering its development.

It is one of the apps I use the most but one thing that really bum me out is the fact that they haven’t innovated or maintained up to date with technology. The two things that will make this app my favorite is a way to make polls in group chats. Imagine being able to know who is going to the event by just clicking “Assisting” or “Not going”. Imagine being able to decide which photo to upload to Instagram by just letting people choose the one they prefer or even tell you which shoes to buy. The other thing that would improve the app would be Apple Watch compatibility. Being able to tell Siri to send a message right from your wrist or even respond whenever you want and not just when they send a message to you.

Let’s say for instance, someone texts you and you’re about to respond but you get a group notification. You attend to the group for a while and when you come back to your chat you may forget about the previous text. Time goes by and you have conversations with other people until you realize you didn’t respond to that one text from a day ago.

 The process of having to find the text itself whilst responding to others you may not have replied to; one by one is taxing .

I suggest for the next update, maybe we can install an “Unread” filter that allows us to sort the messages by those opened and those unopened. This will really make it convenient for responding quickly and keeping in touch with all messages. This would make a huge difference honestly.

 I would really appreciate it if you took this concept into consideration.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-11T09:41:14-07:00

For those of us with many chats and many friends on WhatsApp there’s no ability to be invisible while on and anyone may say you and contact.

Delete operation didn’t really erase data and docs but bad thing is that it doesn’t allow WhatsApp to function when it gets reinstalled. 

Most disappointing thing in this situation is that WhatsApp support team’s lack of intent to address this issue for their loyal customer.

It is one of the best app in the world.
One thing I should mention that after searching a new number in the contacts if you just tap on any part of the contact it directly goes for call. I think sometimes it’s embarrassing that may be you are not sure that the saved number is actually to whom you want to call.

Several glitches have recently been fixed as well. Thanks for that!

One persistent glitch that has not been effectively addressed is that no matter how I configure the notifications, whenever I receive a WhatsApp message now, it just pops up right in the center of my screen instead of at the top, as I had set it up to do. This gets in the way of anything I may be doing, like streaming a show, or using another app.

Interestingly, after the latest update, my messages started appearing as a banner at the top of the screen - as they once used to do - and they lingered there (as I also set them up to do) but out of the way. So I thought the problem had finally been fixed. However, after an hour or two, the WhatsApp messages I received went right back to popping up right in the center of my screen; obstructing everything.
