Three weeks later, the card has not arrived. So I proceeded to try to reach customer service via chat which is a perk of the Premium plan. Low and behold, there is no customer service live chat feature in their help bar so you have to wait for a response email from an inexistent support team. Even after sending an email, common protocol is to receive a confirmation email. However, Revolut doesn’t have that, meaning your message may or may not have reached them. No way of knowing. 

Also, be aware that there is no phone number to call. For a bank in the United States to not have a customer service phone number is a huge red flag.

If you have funds left in the app, there is no way to withdraw them without having the card, which once again they didn’t send. So, essentially you are stuck having money in a mysterious bank account without any customer support and you watch it get drained by the monthly premium fees. Another huge red flag.

If you terminate the premium plan early, they charge $19.98. So basically, you pay $20 for a card and $19.98 for early termination of premium plan, you cannot get your money back and you have no way to speak to somebody in order to get help. Imagine getting stuck in a foreign country being at the mercy of Revolut - it would be a total nightmare! This is a total SCAM so please do not fall for this.

They told me when I got back home I had to close the UK account in order to sign up for a USA account and just changing details wasn’t an option. So after many hoop jumping to close the account from the UK and losing all my payment history I’ve gone to sign up here in the USA and after uploading my ssn and my identification documents I get an alert saying my account is deactivated and they can’t offer me an account. REALLY??? 

After all the praise and people I have recommended to sign up with you and now this! It’s ok I’ll go elsewhere!!! I don’t need you anyway thank goodness!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-29T21:00:33-07:00

10877482227,MinecraftDude11,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id368257798,10.12,1,Worst money app,"Honestly my experience using this app for only a few months is honestly pretty terrible, there's no live customer support you will just get sent around in circles by a computer and you will be waiting forever for help. The ""minimum"" fee is $20 which is outrageous in my opinion because if someone only needed $5 per say I have to take out an extra $20 just to send it which is stupid. The thing that pisses me off the most is if someone REQUESTS money the app says ""YoU OwE""... no I don't ""owe them"" anything that's just how much the person requested and it makes it seem like I'm in debt towards that person. Terrible app do no recommend, download any other money app but this one",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-29T05:59:14-07:00
10876886988,Nick-o-name,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id172248853,10.12,1,Last update is terrible,The last changes to the app are terrible. They have removed all the best functionality and just made it more inconvenient or impossible to find. The watchlist has disappeared and been sort of broken down across multiple sections so there is no more overview. No idea how to manage the watchlist. Watchlist shortcut only shows 2 items and you can select which and selecting it doesn’t take you to a proper overview. The converter feature has now been hidden away under a menu in the accounts screen. All the other features from the favorites button have been removed or dispersed across the app into hidden places never to be seen again. What were the developers thinking? What a mess!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-29T02:26:10-07:00
