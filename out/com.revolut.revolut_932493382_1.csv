No sooner did I have money on my card than it was hit with a charge for 196.15. I opened a case stating that the charge was fraudulent and blocked payments to that merchant. The charge was still pending at the time I alerted you that it was a fraudulent charge. It could have easily been frozen at that time. I went down to the police station and filed a police report for it also. I also contacted Hellcase.com. The responded the next day with a letter stating they had closed the fraudulent account, but the bank would have to do the chargeback. That letter is attached I also contacted Etsy because that is the only place I had entered my account details. They deny any responsibility for the charges. I have subsequently closed my Etsy store because of this. The reason I am so upset with Revolut is because you could have taken a simple action and froze the transaction as I requested. It’s my account. Wouldn’t I know if charges were fraudulent? The charges were still pending even after you wrote me back and said there was nothing you could do. Everyone at Revolt wants to make it my fault for entering my card information on Etsy. Who gets a card and never uses it? That is ludicrous. All you had to do is freeze the transaction and cancel my card.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T04:07:59-07:00
