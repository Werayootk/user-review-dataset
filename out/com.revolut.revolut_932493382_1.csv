Until recently they held my weekly payment for unemployment to verify its origin. I thought that was weird since it’s issued by the government but I verified it and the rep said I shouldn’t have an issue. One week followed without a hitch but now, they are holding another. This time, it’s been over a week with no explanation on why they are holding it. Every customer service rep uses the same excuse that “a higher team is investigating this, contact us tomorrow”. Investigating WHAT? I’ve already verified it, it’s an unemployment check I NEED TO LIVE ON during these Covid times and you are holding my money with no reason given. And giving me the same excuse over and over that it’s being looked into and the relevant team will contact you. Looking into WHAT?! It’s an unemployment check! If you have important deposits coming in, DON’T USE REVOLUT. They will hold your money with no explanation and no timing given on resolution.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-15T07:27:03-07:00

I am so disappointed in this company. They lie to you, they steal your money. They’ll freeze your account and decline transactions even when the funds are there!!! They won’t respond to your chat messages for hours (BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIVE PHONE CALL OPTION, only automated system.) and they will repeat the same thing over and over with no kind of update or result. Then you’ll get passed around to different agents every 30 mins so you have to re-explain yourself.
They’ll not authorize your transactions at times and your purchase will get declined, again, even when the funds are there in the account!!! 
I am warning you to not go with this company and stay far away, you will ultimately regret it and there is a possibility you won’t have access to your funds either, it’s actually a guarantee. I was stranded away from my home and locked out of my account for simply making deposits. 
I can’t believe I have been treated like this and I STILL don’t have access to my funds. They even had the audacity to offer me to file a complaint through survey monkey which is not a site directly connected to the company which shows you how not serious they are. In times of emergencies or urgency, I was ignored and mistreated terribly when it’s literally my own money. Banking with Revolut is the WORST decision I have EVER made.

I think only about a month ago they were like ‘oopsies there was an error now you can use your account’. I attempted it recently and it kept failing my transfer saying that the address didn’t match my bank address. I went to my profile and changed my address and also tried to find if there was a way to update my address for the connected account specifically. That app is definitely not intuitive at all to navigate. After a while I gave up and just used apple pay. I reached out to their customer service through the chat again today. I was waiting in line for 3 hrs, and then even though I requested help for that particular error message, I was told to clarify, which meant I had to go back to my transfer history, which I did, and then lost my connection with that agent. Tried to reconnect several times, and their chat just does not even work anymore . It’s a blank page. I’m just tired at this point.

I opened the account on May 2nd and transferred $20 to test how it works and found contactless payments to be superior to our primitive US cards which must be inserted into the payment terminals.  Excellent!  If there is no physical card, there is no possibility of skimming or reading the card details.
Unfortunately, it is now May 16th and I am no longer able to transfer funds into the card and the error message is that I have exceeded the limit of my card account.  My debit card has a daily limit of $1500 and I have been able to transfer less than $100 since May 2nd.  Customer Service is basically non-existent except for a childish chat bot which suggests I use a different (unavailable) method to top up the card.
I am offered the opportunity to upgrade to the premium version of the service but have no assurance it would would work any differently.
Revolut may be useful if only inside the United States but in Italy, it is simply frustrating and annoying.  Even if I were back home, I would still have only the one method of topping up the card from my debit card account.  I don’t actually see the point of a service that is so restrictive it can only be used upt to a limit of $100 and fails forever after.

Also they wouldn’t give me a refund for the money I paid to be a member since they didn’t provide any of the services the membership was suppose to provide!

Do not use if you travel a lot, you risk no access to your money. The short of it - my account was shut down for security reasons with no notification. Someone tried to send money and it was denied. A few days later I tried to use it and received a message to contact customer service. Got a message that they will respond next day!!! 2 hours later another automated message came that the account is closed. No live person, no reasoning. So it seems the account was already blocked days or weeks before that but there was zero communication. Imagine leaving for abroad relying on that money. The whole reason I needed it was because I’m a dual citizen and travel a lot. Even after my account was closed I kept getting marketing emails. The low or no fees can only be achieved by no customer service and relying on a poorly developed AI algorithm. You get what you pay for with this app.
UPDATE: Several months after my account was shut down and I was told to move all my money out, someone who didn’t know actually managed to send me money. How is that possible with an account which was shut down months ago? This app is so mismanaged.

I’m glad it has the option to keep the old interface, but please, Revolut team, take some more time to actually research if the users like it. From the brand perspective, I feel like you’re losing it. All-caps text is now reminiscent of your rival “Wise.” It feels like you’re trying to be like them, but actually you had a great sense of identity before, it stood out. Also :) Why purple all of the sudden? The bank money interface should stay familiar and recognizable, moderately strict; I believe blue is the standard for a reason. You might have been a little too quick, that’s how it feels like. Some interface elements of the new design don’t align and don’t feel cohesive—like action buttons.

Firstly it took longer than initially stated to launch there and when it did, I am regretting being an early adopter. I have encountered numerous challenges from incorrect information being stored to being locked out of the system at various times. I understand the financial regulations that govern banks especially in the US market but there has to be a systematic change on Revolut’s end to provide excellent service products on a seemingly flawless system because customers will not be enticed to move to this system in the US.

I highly recommend you stay away. I ignored the bad reviews thinking they were surely one offs, but they are consistent. Customer service is terrible, as many have said it feels like you’re taking to a robot reading from a script when you’re not. No way to talk on the phone. 

Revolut could be so great but if they’re unable to be a constant hassle then they shouldn’t be in business.

I succeeded to transfer 5K one day and nothing the next. After a week on chat (they have no live support) I was told that it “might be a technical problem”, that it was due to a limit but they couldn’t tell me the limit — but only that it was in place every 24 hours and finally that I can transfer 6500 but I have to wait till the last transfer went through (which takes 5 days). I asked to close my account but was told I have to have a 0 balance to do so. And their own help information says that there is no transfer limit. 

It feels almost like criminal behavior as they are holding my money and not allowing me access to it in a timely manner.

Customer support is possibly the worst I have seen.

I’ve also gotten completely different answers from CS.

If I change my budget for one month the app automatically changes my budget for the previous months as well. Fortunately, I’m able to personally keep track of when I do and do not stay under budget, but it would be nice if the budgeting feature took this into consideration.

Also regarding budgeting and accepting payments from friends: it would be nice if you could assign the payments from friends to say, a restaurant charge. I’ve begun avoiding paying the bill with friends because it messes up my restaurant budget in the app. It would be cool if I could pay for a table of four, have my three friends pay me, then assign those payments to that restaurant charge. 

The app has all sorts of bells and whistles I don’t bother using. As the savings feature isn’t interest-bearing I don’t bother using it. I also don’t use the cryptocurrency feature since it seems pretty pointless when you can use other crypto-dedicated apps. I also don’t understand the donation feature—I just donate to organizations directly.

Friday: “Upgrade to premium” & “invite your friends!”, Thursday : “take our survey on how you save”, yesterday: “you can now send money to Mexico for free!”   How about you quit bother me and only notify about transactions I make.  Also, several features have said “coming soon” for well over a year. Coming soon means next week, imminently, not it’s and idea you had one time.  Super obnoxious app.  Let people control what types of notifications they get so I can opt out your marketing garbage and still get notified when my card is charged.  Summary: get transfer wise.  It’s way better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-30T12:28:09-07:00
10415641759,Naomi Z. B.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1195133310,9.25,4,A godsend during my recent travel,"Revolut was extremely helpful during my trip abroad. I travelled from the US to France and transferring money from my US bank account to Revolut then exchanging it to Euros was a breeze on the app. I like that I can go to the ATMs Revolut lists as being compatible with their cards and withdraw cash without ATM fees and pay Revolut less than $4 in service fees. It was, however, frustrating that I had to wait 24 hours to withdraw more money if I had already taken out more than $200. I recommend this for US-based travelers who only want cash when needed vs withdrawing a lot of foreign currency up-front just to not use all of it. I can’t speak for their actual banking nor their customer service, but as a casual user of the product, I would recommend.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-28T04:28:57-07:00

While it’s worked from time to time and proved convenient, overall this card has been nothing but an absolute headache since day one and a constant battle to maintain and keep active due to their over the top security protocols and staff that seem to all display lack of empathy and common sense to the users needs and loyalty.  The over reach for personal data is unbelievable and I would warn anyone considering Revolute to be prepared to lay out all your personal affairs to them in order to satisfy their databases. This was a mistake and I’m happily canceling this card if tyranny !! Good Riddance!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-15T17:28:27-07:00

It was very easy to add money to the account, and the potential for using it for international transactions was helpful. Unfortunately things have gone downhill as of late. Nowadays I keep getting topoff issues- this isn't an issue with other apps using the same debit card and wasn't an issue before for Revolut. I want to move on at this point but because I have a small positive balance on the card I can't close the account, and I am unable to withdraw money to zero it out... bonus apy may be a dream if you get direct deposit, but doesn't help if your employer pays via paper checks. If you use only this account and get direct deposit into it this may work for you, but at this point it's not for me.

Seriously Revolut, either fix your authentication server or let us withdraw cash! I'll be figuring out a work around then keep focusing on the money services that work better for my needs...",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-13T22:25:54-07:00

They may not realize it - but that’s their main value proposition for me.  Not the currency exchange.

Also for context, the Singapore government decided to implement a rule limiting the amount one can spend with a ebank like Revolut to $33k per year. Will not comment on the reason, wisdom or efficacy of this move. It’s as it is. 

Now comes Revolut completely making a huge mess of a great app simply because they cannot do basic math. The government apparently asks them to calculate this restriction on a rolling basis. Basic math would allow Revolut to figure out how much I’ve spent in the last 365 days, compare with the maximum and decide whether to allow the transaction or not.  Now they obviously do this math, else they’d be in violation of the regulation.  However, the message we, users get is a vague and highly USELESS “you’re approaching the limit of transactions of this type”. 

Seriously, Revolut. You want me to believe you can handle my finances but you cannot be bothered to do a simple math to tell me how much more I have to spend? 

Also, since you’re at it, please be honest and change your advertising for premium metal cards to read “max of 33k in transactions” not “unlimited” as it reads today and which is false and misleading. 

Thank you",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-05T03:59:54-07:00
10683518111,jashtor,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id140926254,10.8,1,MISLEADING PERKS FOR PREMIUM ACCOUNT,"I am writing this review to express my profound disappointment with Revolut's travel insurance service. Initially attracted by the promise of amazing perks for trip cancellation coverage, my experience with the claims process has been far from satisfactory.

I filed a claim last May, and despite assurances that all required documents were received and the claim was filed, I have yet to receive any updates or a claim number. The communication channels provided for additional information, including email and phone, have proven to be unresponsive. This lack of communication has left me in the dark about the status of my claim, causing considerable frustration and inconvenience.

Adding to the frustration is the ineffective assistance from Revolut's support team. Despite numerous attempts through calls and emails, I have not received any resolution or meaningful information about the progress of my claim. The disparity between the advertised benefits of their travel insurance and the actual customer service experience has left me deeply dissatisfied.

I hope this review serves as constructive feedback for Revolut to reevaluate and enhance its customer service and claims handling processes. Based on my regrettable experience, I would caution potential customers to approach Revolut's travel insurance service with skepticism and consider alternatives with more reliable support.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-11T14:32:58-07:00
