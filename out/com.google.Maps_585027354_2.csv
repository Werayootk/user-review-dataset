It has been my go-to navigation tool for all my travels, and I appreciate the continuous updates to ensure the most accurate mapping experience. Thank you, Google Maps, for keeping me on the right track!

11099391520,mindctrl,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id30511508,6.108.1,3,Review feedback system not good,"The new way of interacting with reviews is not as good as before. When a review has inaccurate information, you used to be able to vote a thumbs down. Now that‚Äôs gone and the report feature doesn‚Äôt have an option for inaccuracies. The press and hold feature doesn‚Äôt have appropriate options either. Parsing through multiple emojis is more cognitive load for everyone. And I think it‚Äôs safe to say the ‚Äúmind blown‚Äù emoji is virtually useless. Please revert these gamified infantile things and keep Google Maps serious.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T10:45:06-07:00
