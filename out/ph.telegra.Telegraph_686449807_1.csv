But unfortunately it has only voice calling feature which makes me to use another apps for that feature only! I cordially expect that developer will add that asap! 

It’s passcode locking feature in order to provide best security to its user, but apps lock doesn’t work immediately! Which should be must! The minimum time is 1 minutes! It should be locked within a fraction of second as some other apps do! As long as we have face unlocking feature so it will not bother us! 
Lastly, I have facing an unexpected issue sometimes! I’m not sure where I tap but when it happens telegram stop functioning & start glitching non stop glitching! It needs the apps to launch again! 
So please make the apps more lovely by adding video calling features and make the passcode lock more quicker & fix the bug! Thanks for reading with patience!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-20T08:54:38-07:00

I honestly believe that is a crucial disadvantage to this application I say that because, I have family and friends that live all over the world whether it be in different states or different countries and we all have telegram on our phones. That being said we would like to I’ll be able to talk in a video group chat with each other which we are unable to because this application doesn’t provide that option. So therefore since telegram doesn’t provide a video group chat option we have to download another application to be able to do that Task. Which in my opinion is extremely ridiculous because you should be able to perform the test on this app as well. Instead of making people waste valuable space on their phones by download in other apps to perform the test where y’all can provide that ability on your app so we don’t have to download other apps to perform that and we could save space on our Devices.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-18T07:00:42-07:00

It is apparent that the introduction of the premium subscription has shifted the focus towards pushing users into purchasing it, leading to an unfortunate degradation of the basic functionalities. Notably, the severe limitation placed on sending messages, even when used responsibly, is particularly concerning. As an illustration, I found myself unable to communicate effectively within work-related groups, where I was seeking job opportunities. The necessity to compose messages daily, amidst the flood of communication, to ensure visibility for potential employers is both impractical and counterproductive.

Despite multiple attempts to address this issue through support inquiries, the lack of response is disheartening. Instead, I received a notification suggesting that the solution lies in acquiring a premium subscription – specifically, to regain the ability to send messages. This approach appears illogical and far from user-friendly. While I am inclined to assign a zero-star rating to reflect my discontent accurately, unfortunately, this option isn't available. I remain hopeful that a more competent alternative emerges in the near future, drawing users away from this application.

This issue is particularly frustrating because I don't face the same problem when using WhatsApp for calls, including video calls, which work perfectly fine. I understand the importance of maintaining privacy on Telegram, especially the ability to block someone from calling me, but the call quality issue has forced me to resort to WhatsApp. I'm currently using an iPhone 13 Pro Max with a reliable internet connection of 20 Mbps, so I believe the issue lies with Telegram itself. I kindly request the Telegram team to address this issue promptly. It's essential for users to have a seamless calling experience within the app, and I hope that this problem can be resolved soon. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The worst bug I have encountered (three times by now) is that the app stops sending me notifications at all. Out of nowhere. I get no calls and no messages, not even badges on the app. This happens regardless if I try to play with my notification settings, and doesn’t even go away if I reinstall the app (which erases my secret chats as well). The last two times I’ve just had to wait for the app to fix itself since I couldn’t find a single fix online. This time is my last straw. If it weren’t for the secret chat functions and screensharing capabilities, I wouldn’t be using Telegram. But taking away my notifications really make me want to use something else.

Other bugs include recursive screen-in-screens during screen sharing, hearing your own voice when sharing audio, and suddenly not hearing the other person.

 But, in some areas telegram falls short due to lack of video messaging, the traffic seems to be lower than other platforms, and searching for groups isn't as easy as some may like it to be. Regardless, a video chat feature similar to instagrams live mode would be perfect for the group chats. If possible maybe even allowing features thats on discord to be on the app, better bots would be a plus that telegram makes themselves rather than relying on other people bots.

Telegram is kind of like a world, you can create public and private groups and channels to share content. Sometimes I spend hours in different channels, there are lots of great news, recreational and… channels.
The share feature is also a breeze. unlike whatsapp you don't need to download a file and then upload it for sharing (yeah! this is why whatsapp is so slow on sharing), Telegram just share the content with the name of its original uploader, and you can easily click and checkout the channel (if it was shared from a channel) or contact the user.

Destructible messages are a plus. I like the spoiler option it’s pretty cool, along with many other features.

 Previously Telegram was lacking video calls, Group Video Calls, FaceID. I’ve noticed they added it on which is great!

 End to End encryption should be standard. Why go through the hassle of doing secret chats? The option should be the other way around “unsecret chats” 

Please add Pin Numbers. Some people dont like to share phone numbers. Having the option for Pin number to add users on Telegram is a Marvelous idea. 

More business features are needed like having the capability to pay and receive payments within the app. Having an online store. 

 Add a “transparent theme” for themes and colors that be awesome! 

 One thing needs FIXING. The app has been updated. Now it’s complicated and confusing to change the color themes. When applying the colors and theme it does not update it.

 Someone sent me a voice note. It took 12 hours to receive it. The voice note stayed at a downloading state the whole time. I have 5G service.

This is only describing the various situations where forex group chats exist on the service. Nothing against the actual service itself, only the Forex groups on the app
***Disclaimer***

So the app is wonderful in terms of communication, and a good competitor to Whatsapp (another wonderful messaging service). My only beef is the fact that I was the idiot (last October) to download the app due to being suckered by a rando online about a bitcoin forex. I was unaware of such financial lingo, assuming that I would get my return profit in 48 hours. 

Biggest mistake

If people recommend you to various places that offer a return profit via forex, DO NOT EXPECT MONEY BACK IMMEDIATELY. You’ll only lose your money due to the highly volatile nature of not only Bitcoin, but also Forex itself is essentially a bigger gamble due to various international markets operating around the clock. Whether it be through Facebook or any other social media accounts, you cannot be suckered by such things. It’s a pandemic and the last thing one should want is to lose money. 

It’s precious and you should not let your emotions control the wallet. Ones intellect and wise choices dictates money. So if you’re looking to save money, do the research, be financially literate, and save the money.

Everyone says this is the achilles heal, and it’s weird that the issue has never been resolved. Here’s a suggestion for the developer. Add a feature of searching for Groups/Channels by allowing the owner to place their G/C into CATEGORIES (such as “health”, “food”, etc) then everything search related, falling into those categories, is displayed by title. Keep the Keyword searches, just add this capability. There are groups on Telegram that were formed specifically to allow owners to ADVERTISE their group, in order to grow, because the search feature is so inadequate. Please address this issue.

If anything, the number of dropped characters is worse than it was originally.

Original review:
Updating to the latest version introduced a really bad bug that causes keyboard input to get corrupted.  When I type on my Bluetooth keyboard now, Telegram acts like I also typed random backspaces every few characters, completely messing up the words I type, and inducing auto-correct to change many of the messed-up words to something completely different.  Please fix this right away!
I've installed every update since the bug was introduced, and none of them have addressed the problem!  I just updated again today (Jan. 9), and the problem is as bad as ever.

“Raise to listen“ is forced on. Any random time something comes close to your phone, it decides you’ve raised it to your head and starts a voice recording. There’s a secret debug menu (not mentioned anywhere) accessed by tapping “settings” 10 times, but even turning it off there doesn’t fix it. 

This breaks when more since circle videos autoplay — a conversation with them means you’ll constantly be going back to watch someone’s that you missed, and then *your* video after will play. Possibly at double their volume. And you’ll have to stop it manually, every single time. 

But what’s worse is that if any circle video is paused, and there’s play/pause on the top bar, then raise to listen will override and play *no matter what*. Even if you have it forced off in the secret debug menu. 

For every hour of circle video conversation, this means manually stopping autoplay and having to hit the little X literally hundreds of times just to make your own recordings not play loudly at you, and your phone’s sensor not delete what you were recording because a cat got too close to your phone and it decided it was your ear. 

All because Telegram really, *really* doesn’t like giving you options as to how you use the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2020-02-21T21:01:08-07:00

It’s baffling they choose to force users have to deal with this, it’s the one thing that’s making me consider leaving the app altogether.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-15T18:12:11-07:00

But,"I love telegram, a friend put me onto the app. It's nice for dating when you don't want to give out your number or socials to stay discreet. You can only voice call no video call.. I don't mind though, you can send videos, pictures and voice messages. But they took away timed photos/videos. That was my FAVORITE feature, it's like Snapchat if I want to send a video or picture I could time it... But I can't anymore, please bring feature back. It seems like every single update they take away a great feature, I shouldn’t have to download something on my computer to sign into a new phone , I know it makes you guys think you’re being secure but it’s making it more complicated.... bout ready to say a few this app and go to WhatsApp , not everyone has a computer they can concurrently download on just to sign in on a new phone . Like come on do better",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-09T22:47:33-07:00

If you’re looking for a secure way to send and receive messages /photos/and files without being forced to give out private information, this is the app for you! It’s literally the BEST messenger app out to date & worth every penny of the paid subscription!!!!  If you enjoy the product , why not pay for it??? They have to make their money back from all that they put in. Everything is quality including the stickers!!!! I absolutely love them!!! They only thing I’d add is fonts , (so I don’t have to use other apps to copy & paste them in) & it would be nice if they could ban screen recording as well.  

Moral of the story: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 10 stars ✨ hands down.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-02T04:54:10-07:00

I was intrigued and decided to purchase it for myself, as well as gift it to a friend. However, to my disappointment, the feature does not seem to work for either of us. Although I write in English and my friend writes in Russian, our messages are not automatically translated and we still have to manually translate them. Similarly, when communicating with someone who writes in Ukrainian, my English messages to them are translated, but their messages to me are not. 

I only use the desktop version of Telegram when I need to save photos to my computer, and I have noticed that the desktop and web versions do translate messages properly.

Furthermore, it appears that support for Telegram is lacking, as it is supposedly provided by volunteers and I have not received any response to my requests for assistance. While I understand that volunteers may not be able to respond promptly, it would be beneficial if Telegram could improve their customer support.

Overall, I hope that Telegram takes note of my review and works on fixing the issue with the automatic message translation feature.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-13T10:28:05-07:00
