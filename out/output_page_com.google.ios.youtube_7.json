Once I upgraded to the new iPhone 14 Pro I‚Äôve been having issues that are getting very annoying. I start a video and it plays for about 30 seconds and then it stops. I tap the screen and the time played shows 0:00 so I have to start again and try to fast forward to where I was. It‚Äôs super laggy when you try to fast forward and it‚Äôll pause again many times after starting at a different point in the video and show it‚Äôs farther back then where you were and you have to blindly fast forward again to find where you were. Loading is weird as well, I check my connection and it‚Äôs very good so that‚Äôs definitely not the issue. I‚Äôve killed the app, restarted the phone, deleted and re-installed the app, nothing has helped.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-14T04:29:50-07:00"},{"id":"8701777605","userName":"Gizmuth","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1314587943","version":"17.20.3","score":4,"title":"Animation FPS problem","text":"Obviously the most unbeatable social app. But I‚Äôm not here for that today.

For example, I needed to make a new account, so I searched a public playlist that I made with my old account and saved the playlist. The old account will eventually get deleted because I do not fully own the account, and if I want to make a new version I will have to save each one at a time to a new playlist, which could take a long time. It would also be nice for making a supercompiled playlist out of some of my smaller lists. \n\nAlso the comments being moved is strange; I often accidentally go to the channel of the video I am watching instead of the comments because it is hard to tell which is which at a glance","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-23T01:20:05-07:00"},{"id":"7294547109","userName":"tbzjcm","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id340570349","version":"16.16.4","score":1,"title":"New video quality selection","text":"Please either revert to the old quality selection or introduce a way for us to choose for it to use the highest possible quality on the video for every video. Even though I went in the settings and chose ‚Äúhigher quality‚Äù for all videos it is only ever 720p so I have to change the quality on every single video. At least the old would remember within a session the quality you selected last so I could just watch a 2160p60 video and check that quality and all videos after that would be in highest quality. Since I watch a lot of HQ videos this new system is extremely annoying as it only makes the quality system harder to change, and now I have to manually change it every single video. On the other hand, THANK YOU for removing shorts, that was the most annoying thing you‚Äôve ever done, thank you for getting rid of that tab.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-03T14:23:06-07:00"}]
