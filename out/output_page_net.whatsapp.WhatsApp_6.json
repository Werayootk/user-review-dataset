And that is creating an app for Apple Watch users. Or at least a functional notification and response menu. So that when you receive a voice message from someone, you can actually listen to it without having to go to your phone. Which is the whole point of Apple Watch in the first place. And regarding the response options. It would be nice to be able to send more than one single emoji back, or to reply with a voice message, or at least proof/change your dictated message  if there‚Äôs a mistake in it. \n\nBasically make an Apple Watch WhatsApp app!!
