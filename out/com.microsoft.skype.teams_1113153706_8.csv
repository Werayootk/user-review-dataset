There is the beginnings of a robust tool. You really need to spend sometime with it before you have a large group on it.  There is so many ways to communicate, you need to understand who and how works together. Because it is not for everyone and there needs to be some ground rules and a culture on how and where you chat, share, todo, delegate, meet and all the apps. And I am sure I will have more to discover.  It seams to integrate with my cell phone very well. 

What I would like to see:
Spell suggestions for those of us who can’t. 

I am currently a guest on two other teams, and when I have one of those current, I can’t answer a call or even here it to switch to answer. 

It would be nice to be able to shut it off at some point on your phone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-22T16:41:21-07:00

It has so many issues and it depends on what devices are being used as it’s compatible with some more than others. Microsoft stream makes me pull my hair out. Hyperlinks to videos does not click at one button. I click 10-20 times, and all it does is highlight. I click around the hyperlink, in the hyperlink, around the message box, and after a minute of spastic clicking, it finally opens in a window in which theatre mode is not theatre mode. It cuts off (this is across different types of devices and whether it’s web or app based).

I have to completely hard close the app and start it again for the message to then appear. This isn’t just me, but is the same for the two other people on my team.

Second, phone calls. This system isn’t worth bothering with on mobile. The quality is atrocious and the transferring system doesn’t work at all.

Can’t we have a basic authentication- out of band e.g to ensure that my personal email is not misused by some random person using it on Teams. I looked into the invite and have to send a email to a email in that invite to remove me. How do i get myself unsubscribed from what I didn’t subscribe to begin with.

The reason I’m not giving five stars is that the Planner Kanban view needs usability improvements.
