Other ad categories such as alcohol and gambling have preference toggles to hide those ads, but there is no such toggle for religion. This evident Christian ad supremacy hurts Reddit‚Äôs interactions with its users by sending incompatible yet alienating ads to the incorrect audience, and refusing to allow users to choose to hide ads they find offensive or antagonistic.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-09T12:39:00-07:00

It‚Äôs a worse experience to use than just going to the web version of Reddit in Safari. They don‚Äôt seem to have any interest in improving it. And they shut down all third-party apps, including many that worked much better than this, for what I can tell are purely arrogant and selfish reasons. They could have told third-party apps they had to deliver ads. They could have bought the apps and turned them into the official app. They could have hired the developers to improve their own app. Tons of choices. They picked the one that hurts their own users the most. Why? Frankly, it‚Äôs insulting. And now they‚Äôre really trying to go public with this level of disdain for their users?

At any rate, just use Reddit on the web. It works a lot better than this app does.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-09T11:07:44-07:00
