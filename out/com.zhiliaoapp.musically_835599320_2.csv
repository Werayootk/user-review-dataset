There’s lots of fun stuff, my mom is on the burlesque side of tiktok, she doesn’t go on it a lot but I think some things make her happy which makes me happy! So, there is one disappointing thing, that is live’s. You can’t go live unless your sixteen and have 1000 followers. And sometimes if you see someone’s profile which is live and you click on it, it has already ended. Also there are adds but you can scroll away from them so I don’t think they’re a big deal. There are people from all over the world and make lots of different types of content, it’s so easy to watch a lot of tiktok but you can’t sit at on your phone forever lol. It used to be a struggle to get off of tiktok because I was addicted but I’ve gotten over that struggle. Oh, there’s another thing I find annoying, every once in a while there will be a video made by tiktok and it’s things like “hold up, you’ve been scrolling for way to long” etc. and they can get annoying. That’s pretty much it. There’s emo tiktok there’s slime tiktok there’s gacha tiktok there’s plant tiktok there’s animal tiktok etc. HAVE FUN WATCHING IF YOU DECIDE TO GET TIKTOK!!!

It’s got some major issues though. First of all, I don’t have a post button. Where it says drafts, there is just one button, and that’s to add the video to your drafts. I have looked up videos on where it is, because I guess I just don’t have one. I have put a lot of work into making tik toks, but I can’t even post them. Please at least tell me why this is happening, or if I’m just being dumb, tell me. Second of all, whenever I try to search ANYTHING, literally anything, it says “sorry this feature is currently unavailable” and I can’t search up anything AT ALL! It’s just super anoying, again just tell me if I’m being dumb, but I don’t think I am. Also it’s the same thing for writing comments :/ Third of all, I DONT HAVE A “FOR YOU” PAGE!!! I enjoy watching tik toks that are related to the ones that I already enjoy. But I still, have looked through the entire app, but I don’t have a for you page. Please try and fix these issues, because I think that they ruin almost the entire experience for me.

I don’t participate in lots of plat forms but I enjoy watching. The ones I d participate in is always fun. We have some very nice people on here and lots of very rud ones also. I am on here to met people from all over and love to watch the different things such cooking, giving advice, make up, doing, hair, and just have fun. Their are plenty of things to watch so if you don’t like something that you see just scroll on by. That is what I can’t understand is why many people can’t understand that. My favorite thing to watch is the elderly people who are having dementia . It is sad but very interesting how their mind works and how the caregivers can handle them. They are so cute and blessed to have family to take care of them. I would like to thank the makers of TicTok for having this so we can have something to enjoy. I am a widower and I watch this instead of TV and get so much enjoyment out of it. Their a few things that seem a little unfair at times but I don’t know the whole story so I can’t know who is right or wrong.

Everyone on Instagram always tries to be perfect and fit into society so they can be accepted and not feel alone or like a misfit. Whereas TikTok shows the REAL side. People looking however they looking. Saying whatever they feeling with out out it becoming an unsafe social environment(aka bullying etc). It’s a safe place for me to have fun laugh and share the joy with my family and friends. additionally it’s even more informative than any other social media platform for example at first I was a little confused about what is going on between Ukraine and Russia and Instagram mislead me into thinking America was going into war with Russia through memes, videos etc however I was able to learn more than I ever did through 30 second accurate and precise tik tok videos and even help my friends understand better and correct any misconceptions.

Do NOT let your kids on here.,"As a 21 year old I honestly enjoy this app, I’ve been using it since I was in high school. It can be great entertainment and a great place to learn about different things and topics.

HOWEVER the biggest issue I have with this app is nudity. I have seen probably 20 videos where men had their penis in full view or slightly out of view in the last 2 months. And they do NOTHING about it. I’ve reported so many videos and they always say it “doesn’t violate guidelines” and you can’t get them to reconsider. You can’t write anything to help them know what the report is exactly about to help them see the issue, if it isn’t in full view right at the front of the video they don’t care. It’s honestly infuriating. It’s actually insane. They aren’t even hidden well, any person with eyes can see it but they just don’t care! It’s disgusting. The videos will get mass reported and called out for the nudity and nothing happens! They say this app is for 12+ and you can’t have an account if you aren’t at least 13 but that’s not fool proof. And even then 13, 14 and 15 year olds shouldn’t be seeing that. It’s disgusting. Their team is extremely lazy and terrible moderators. Don’t let your kids on here for their own safety. Not to mention all the pedos, I know they can’t necessarily do anything about that.

By adding a video to your favorites, you can save it and watch it again! Same for you liked videos! When you follow someone, you can see their videos! If you’ve made a video and don’t want to post it yet, or you want to edit it/save it for later/finish the video later on, you can save it to your drafts! The only person who can see it is you! If you don’t feel comfortable with everyone seeing your posts, you can set your account to private and only your followers can see your posts. You can make a profile picture, a bio to share a bit about yourself, and follow your friends! When you’re confused about a trend, you can click the search button and look it up! You can make audios, videos, live-streams, and more! I think tiktok is suitable for anyone above the age of 10, but that depends on parent options of course!

For example sometimes the audio just starts glitching and sounding staticky if you’re recording a video. Another thing is that recently my videos have been delayed after i post them. So i would assume it’s airpods delay however all my videos are delayed now and that’s including ones i posted months ago. Also there are a few things that could make the app better like, when you stitch a video instead of the audio not carrying over, you can have a choice on whether you want to continue it or not. I feel that it would be more efficient and a lot easier if you want to finish an old transition you posted or anything else you might need. I also personally liked the old drafts layout, but it’s fine as is. Another problem is when you’re watching a video and a text or something may be covered by a profile or the caption or anything else on the side, it’s hard to see or read anything so I feel there should be a feature where you can swipe to the left and all those buttons would go away sort of like how it is on a live stream.

I’ve always thought of the app as very easy to use and accessible to all people (especially with the captions added to the app), but the new update that caused the drafts button to shrink has been a big problem to many creators. People are fond of their privacy, yet they still love the idea of making videos. This leads to many creators making little cringy videos that they would then just save to their drafts to post later or to just save the sound. Many have that muscle memory of just automatically clicking the middle of the drafts button, but because of this new update, they have been accidentally posting their drafts. Not only is this a nuisance to mentally check every time that you are not posting a draft, but it can be very compromising to creators who need videos to be only saved in their drafts, away from their followers. These people would be minors or others who are uncomfortable with their face being public, Islamic women who like making videos with their hair but cannot show their hair to the public for religious reasons, and others who make videos for themselves and not for the public eye. This new update has caused a lot of frustration in the community and as an enjoyer of this app, I, and the whole community, would please like it if the drafts button was changed to its original size.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-02T18:36:51-07:00

One day I say a video and thought it was funny and shared it to my friends. Didn’t realize that none of them were being sent and it was because it was saying that every time I sent a message that it was violating the community guidelines. I even sent the letter “O” and told my girlfriend “I love you” and those were immediately taken down too. I did an appeal and they all came back and said it was a mistake. Then it would happen again. Today I went to log into TikTok bc for whatever reason I was logged out and it said that my account was permanently banned because of multiple violations of community guidelines. This is me coming back for being inactive for several days and just and apparently it banned me just for logging back into the app bc I wasn’t banned according to my girlfriend and my emails until I logged in again. Never have been banned before but yeah permaban right out of the get go and the best part is that it didn’t even give me the option to appeal just let me request to download my data whatever that means. So yeah years of memories down the drain bc of that dumb bug. Trash app. Unless I get my data back I’m never using it again because that’s a waste what’s to stop it from happening again anyways? I’m not the first and they didn’t get their accounts back either and apparently they never even got called back just ignored so yeah I’m done.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-19T20:05:35-07:00

Also, the people on Tik Tok are very toxic. It doesn’t do anything about videos or comments that are homophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist etc. The content can be extremely inappropriate, too but they do nothing about it. A lot of people on Tik Tok are bad examples. It has lots of perverts and there is a concerning amount of swearing on the app. A lot of kids watch Tik Tok and start swearing or doing inappropriate dances. There aren’t always trigger warnings on videos, either. I have seen some people traumatized bc of some Tik Tok with dead kids in it. There are videos of people doing inappropriate dances.

TikTok does none of this, and instead plugs its ears and says there’s no problem. A majority of the accounts that like my posts or bookmark my videos are fake porn accounts trying to steal private information, and in spite of making multiple emails to TikTok and filing over 100 reports towards these fake sex accounts, they have told me there’s nothing they can do about it. Furthermore there are constant issues with e-beggars who steal other people’s content begging for cash or straight up pirating movies and making money off of them, as well as multiple pornographic posts that have been reported and TikTok has insisted don’t violate their TOS. Even many of their ads are scams or spam as well, leading to fake sites pretending to “go out of buisness! We have 99% off sale on product!” or “We’re hiring! Click link below for more info!”

I have never ran into so much spam on any other social media platform in my life, and I have never had this many issues with the company refusing to listen to me when I show them the problems at hand.

TikTok has changed my generation so much, (hear me out I know this sounds like something your grandpa  would say), there’s just something wrong with all of us, I think it is because TikTok is so addictive. The short videos on this app make our patience way shorter, and our attention span. The addiction of TikTok keeps you on your phone 24/7, when you are addicted to something you put it above all else, even other human beings, real people with feelings. I’m not making this up, I am seeing it happen to people I know, I’ve seen this generation get meaner and meaner everyday, it could be because of the mental illness trends or the selfishness the addictions push. And the terrible racist algorithm is another reason people are so upset on TikTok, POC creators are getting banned way more than white creators are, and POC creators barely get any reach.

The originality behind my TikTok’s are the ability to take something old and crafting it into something new; give a movie character a new personality and psyche, if not go deeper into it. Also, when the Creator Fund rejects my videos and appeals, not only are you taking away my ability to invest in higher quality video editing tools and software, rejecting every TikTok from the Creativity Fund will cause other TikTok creators to stop using the app, therefore, decreasing its popularity, attractiveness, and ultimately, its relevance.

There’s no way to exit out of it fully and you can’t even just go back to one of the other tabs, you have to fully exit the app which, again, almost always completely resets everything for no apparent reason. A lot of these issues are recent, but for the love of god please fix them because right now the app is borderline unusable.

Also the way it treats its creators with recent content violation rules is absolutely awful and tends to target already suppressed voices. I’ve seen countless completely fine videos be stripped because of the auto-report system, it’s a major issue.

In one of the latest updates, the ability to search up videos was removed, and I just don’t see this benefitting anyone or anything. How does this make the app better? How is this improving the app? How can I feel comfortable updating this app when it’s highly probable I’ll end up regretting it, and the odds are NOT in my favor?? 

After discovering this feature was removed, I went to the App Store and saw that there was another update available. Thinking this would fix the issue and very poor choice on the devs’ behalf, I updated the app. Opened it and the format is completely ruined. There is now a seemingly pointless dislike button attached to each comment and ruining the formatting of the comments, the favorites button is now taking up an unnecessary amount of room on the screen, and there is a new “Friends” tab on the bottom of the screen that just isn’t useful. 

What’s the point of any of this? Why add these useless and hindering features, and yet continue to take away the things that make the app more accessible, the things we truly need?

Also they will suppress content creators like cosplayers or just ban their accounts all together for no reason. They also claim to have rules and stuff against bullying and harassment yet instead when someone comes to them about being bullied or harassed TikTok will punish the person being bullied by suppressing their account and making it so their videos don’t get seen as much rather than dealing with the actual bully, and they also will do this same suppression and content hiding on people who they don’t find attractive, people with disabilities, and people who they think are overweight.

I would 10/10 recommend getting it if you haven’t already. If you are a parent figuring out if your child should be able to get TikTok just know that some songs and some dances are a little inappropriate for the younger kids. If your child is 11+ I would say they will be fine. The app itself is organized very well, so you save videos and sounds to look at later. You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral. So an overall rating on this app, 10/10 would recommended, it keeps you busy all day and there is a video out there that will make you laugh.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-05T23:41:38-07:00

Better than other apps, TikTok asks what you like then shows it on your fyp, you can also customize what creators and specific content is on your fyp by liking videos and following creators.  There are fun trends to follow, with cool filters as well! You can have 8 accounts in total and they won’t be connected to the others, (so if you want a secret account, no one will find you). You can favorite sounds and videos, comments, etc.    That was Tiktoks good features!      Now for the not so great ones. These are the reason TikTok got a 4/5 from me.        So, TikTok has something called community guidelines, to keep every young child on the app safe and just cyber bullying under control in general, but the thing is, these guidelines are commonly false. For example, I got banned on a account with over 1000 followers for bullying even though I was duetting myself saying I was improving. And dumb things get removed on TikTok, such as videos, accounts, and comments. But then there are some cases where someone is doing something so wrong and it doesn’t even get removed until it gets over 1000 reports. That’s messed up. Other than that, tiktok is a great place! I recommend it! Just watch out for those guidelines! 😬👍",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-28T17:43:41-07:00

As an app, I absolutely love it. I did prefer the older version of tiktok, without the “find relatable content” at the top of every tiktok and without your caption sliding upwards every time someone likes. But, as soon as I tried following ONE person, I wasn’t able to. It unfollows them as soon as I leave the page. I’ve researched this problem, and A LOT of users experience this. Sometimes it goes away, but after MONTHS. 
I figured they might be verifying that I’m a real person for the first few days, but it’s been TWO WEEKS. I logged out, logged back in, created a whole new account (still didn’t work), cleared cache, updated the app, deleted other apps, uninstalled TikTok and installed it again, and reported a problem through the app TEN TIMES. Every time, it’s just an automated bot reply, saying that there was suspicious activity. I verified my email, checked my settings, yet still nothing. 
This is incredibly frustrating, because I’ve never spammed anything in this account. There’s no way to reach any real people or agents so it’s just unfair. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to follow anyone ever, or if it’s going to go away and when. I genuinely enjoy TikTok, I think it’s the funniest app HANDS DOWN, and the comments are always the funniest. But, to not be able to follow other users is incredibly frustrating because there’s no email or phone number you can reach out to.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-17T11:13:12-07:00

Definitely has potential to be a great marketing tool EXCEPT for the fact that it upholds a racist infrastructure. White content creators often are allowed to be blatantly racist and spew *actual* racist propaganda and slurs while Black, Indigenous and other POC communities have to walk on egg shells just to keep their accounts from being flagged or banned. Also, the apps algorithm allows white creators to flourish while actively suppressing Black creators’ content. This creates a disparity when it comes to money to be made because more often Black CCs set the most popular trends and receive little to no recognition from the app or other non-Black, specifically white CCs—especially after the trend/sound has become viral. There is also the apps (those who work for/regulate) involvement in the conspiracy to suppress historical and currently relevant information. It does a great job at censorship. If it were not for the app taking constant punitive measures against anything Black and POC CCs make that doesnt directly uplift & support white supremacy and comfort, then this would be a cool place to be. Right now, theres a Black woman follow train trend happening. Not only are we seeing the vitriol from angry white women who are offended they werent centered in a Black space (shocker), we are also experiencing delays and outright deletion when requesting or accepting our Sisters.

Once every 1-2 weeks the app will switch on its own to the newest update from the older version. Then I’ll have access to post Stories, Tiktok Now photos, and use other features but the moment I close the app- sometimes if I just switch apps for a moment all the new features disappear and the app reverts to a previous version. When that happens, I can’t see anything I created with those new features.. This issue has been going on for more than a year.
I’ve asked for answers from Tiktok support, done all their basic troubleshooting, and sent them screenshots and videos of the issue. All I get back are the most irrelevant, unhelpful copy/paste responses from support staff that aren’t even trying to understand the problem. 
It’s extremely disappointing to know that an app with virtually unlimited resources can’t manage escalating issues like these to the appropriate departments to get answers to users. Even if nobody knows why I’m having this issue, they could just say that. But the way they respond to user issues truly gives the feeling they’ve gotten so big they don’t care about every users experience. Aside from algorithm and censorship issues with creators getting videos taken down and accounts wrongfully banned, this is something Tiktok really needs to work on.

So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can’t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn’t work. I’ve tried a bunch of times. It’s probably a bug. Anyways, my second “but” is that even if you don’t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don’t pull up the pop-up that says “SIGN UP” or “LOGIN IN”. I honestly don’t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don’t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it’s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I’m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don’t want to see the pop-up where it says to “SIGN IN” or to “LOGIN IN”. Please don’t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review.

I was too sick to be social, post or like; but I still wanted entertainment. Somewhere I could see comics, musicians from around the world, new artists - mindlessly - but only TikTok of all available apps, had “Take a Timeout” commercial to suggest a break for you when I spent too long online. 
Where every other app is attempting to force me as a user to do things their way (changing format to keep people on, forcing other users other than your friends into your Feed whether wanted or not, or were just becoming repetitive to me); with TikTok, within days, I was watching my favorites, along with suggestions for others; and the algorithm helped find exactly what I was looking for; all by scrolling or amount of time spent watching. It became my reward, when I was getting treatments or a having a really awful rough day; I could lose myself in old & new becoming favorites that had a built in post on self care, saying do something else besides be on their app.

Objectively speaking, the app itself is alright and has no identifiable flaws within its basic functioning.
Contrarily, an extremely large portion of the users along with the content they put out makes viewing content tiring and frustrating. Whether or not the videos in my feed are influenced by the ‘algorithm’ is questionable. I am constantly being bombarded with extremely controversial viewpoints, none of which I am fond of, and am finding it almost impossible to eliminate this content from appearing. The ‘not interested’ button seems to have little to no impact on whether or not I see the content again and sometimes feels as if it has the opposite effect. The few times I’ve found success in adjusting the content in my feed I’ve had to dedicate an unreasonable amount of time immediately swiping past and posts I want to avoid. As time-consuming as this process is, I find that there is no delay whatsoever in reverting back to the old feed I try desperately to distance myself from. I’ve even went as far as creating a new account to try to avoid countless topics that I’m sick of hearing about. Within hours, regardless of my viewing habits, I am back to square one.

The only problem is when you report someone, it doesn’t do much. I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can’t stand this app, it’s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it!

But recently there have been a lot of updates mainly focusing on the drafts and the draft button and I just wanted to point out how much everyone hates it. The draft button went small and now the size is back to normal just because so many people complained about it. But now the drafts are weird. Just stop messing with the drafts it was good how it was before. Another thing, we can’t screen record drafts anymore? Whoever came up with that idea is obviously a very dumb person. Some people don’t like posting their tik toks and would rather screen record them to post in snapchat. Another thing I wanted to write about concerns the lives. I’m 15 and I like going live all the time, my lives however are always getting banned. You guys may be too old to realize this but a great majority of the tik tok population is under the age of 15, and it gets me so frustrated when I see a bunch of other lives with people doing way worse stuff than me not getting banned. It’s just not fair, instead of focusing on things that are actually bad going on in tik tok you guys are focusing on banning 15 year olds for joking around and going live.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-10T12:53:44-07:00

I can stay up all night long and watch tiktok. I’m also a Cindy ent creator and love it. Just wished tiktok would stand behind the creators more. We get a lot of hate when we are known and popular. Always getting reported for things that aren’t against guidelines. And being reported multiple times no matter you appeal is and they put it back up every time. They will delete your account for multiple reports and that is not fair at all. I feel they are a bit biased as well. What the young ones get away with us older ones do not. I’m on my third page and I do nothing wrong. I can help I’m so gorgeous..god made me this way. Otherwise i love the app I love all the wonderful people I’ve met from all over the world and friends I’ve made along the way. They have come along way with their filters and tools to edit. Great music to choose from and so much more. I would recommend Tiktok 100% Just be careful there are lots of scammers and hackers on the site. But that’s everywhere these days. And Tiktok please stand up for your creators!! If one’s been reported 100 times for having pedicures don’t delete the page lol makes no sense.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-13T22:10:25-07:00

And if you’re just watching TikToks, not posting, this is probably going to be a 5-star experience for you. As a content creator, it’s been a bit different. I’m enjoying the success I’ve had in the short amount of time since I created my account, but I gotta say the auto-moderation is just awful. Nobody should ever have a ban enacted on them or a video automatically removed just because the mod AI picked up a no-no word without context, or because people who simply don’t like the content reported it instead of scrolling. And there’s no real way to talk to a human being if you’d like to discuss issues like this. I’d love to have actual humans deciding what happens to my content and my account. And I’d love the option to speak to an actual human when I need to hash out account-related issues. I mean, I like being here so I bend over backwards to try and meet community standards while still retaining the humor that brought followers to my account in the first place. But these auto-disciplinary things still happen, often for no really good reason, and that is super frustrating. Otherwise, it’s a really fun app and I like it. Obviously I’m still around. Just wish we could get this one aspect actually fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-24T09:05:06-07:00

I put my birthday in under my account info. It then said “you are 29 years old” I said yes. Then it said you weren’t eligible for an account when you created your account. This makes no sense, I was 27 or 28 when I made my account. It says the app is for 12 and older so I’m really confused as to what is going on, I was literally 12 in 2005 and tiktok did not exist then lol 
 Now everytime I try to get on tiktok a thing pops up that says I can get my videos emailed to me or choose to have tiktok delete them. I created a lot of memories on there, videos with my kids that I made so they could see one day when they are older, I don’t have a lot of followers but my account is still important to me. I also enjoy watching videos on tiktok I don’t want to have to start all over. 

Just a warning to anyone don’t put your birthday in under your account , this definitely seems like a glitch or flaw in there system. I hope they can fix this so I can get back into my account. I contacted support twice but haven’t heard anything back yet , hoping some fixes this soon as I am really bored and would like to get on tiktok lol",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-25T12:08:07-07:00

It’s not the fault of a computer program, but it’s hard to program a computer to not show favoritism or bias towards those with exceptional abilities. I’ve experienced great things with TikTok. Thank you! And may you have success too ❤️🦋🙌 TikTok representative: Please give clear guidelines on how to follow and Unfollow. Use positive reinforcement instead of negative reinforcement to teach people what the guidelines are. • How can a content creator follow back 1000 people that liked their video in one day? • How are creators supposed to only follow only 30 people an hour when trying to create content and still maintain a job that pays real money? Consequation is a full-time job with all the risk and only hope for a reward at the end of the tunnel. • why not create automatic tools in the creator portal, that are simplifies and makes it easier to use for a dyslexic content creator to handle these tasks, to free up more time so they can do what they do best spending that time on creating content. It’s a win-win for both TikTok and for the creator. Thanks!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-01T08:00:35-07:00

Since I want to have a nice pen for fun and stuff I decided to get one. What I did not realized that the scam company would automatically sign me up for a membership without my knowledge. I did cancel the member ship as soon as I found out about, I don’t even know if the pen will look like it did in the picture I saw. I’m just mad about the fact that TikTok let that ad on there website probably knowing that it was a scam, there had been a video posted 3 days after I saw the ad explaining that’s it’s a scam. I know TikTok may have not seen it yet but it still bugs me that TikTok could have prevented this scam and they didn’t. There are other ads similar to the one I clicked on, and those have been on there for awhile. If they are scams why isn’t TikTok doing anything about it, why are they ignoring this, what is wrong with them if they are ignoring it. I just don’t want to fall for anymore scams or have anyone else fall for. I hope TikTok just thoroughly check ads and their websites to make sure they are not scams before allowing them on the app, but I kinda doubt that they would do anything about this. Other then this I quite like enjoy the app, so I wouldn’t think trust most of the ads on TikTok anymore. There are some you can trust, but other then that don’t trust them yet.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-05T17:45:12-07:00

I followed a couple hashtags, tried liking some videos and following people so that my for you page was more custom to me, since that’s what the algorithm is for, right? Guess not.

After a long session of scrolling - to be fair it was probably way too much time on my part - I noticed that everyone I tried to follow was just… not in my list. As in, I wasn’t following anyone. Anybody I did try to follow was immediately removed from my list, and any videos I tried to like were no longer listed in my likes. After some googling I found out that TikTok apparently shadowbans you from using the app’s features if you like too many videos or follow too many people in a short period. I get that this is a feature created to prevent botting, but… why create an app that’s meant to keep you scrolling and watching, and customizes the content based what you like and who you follow, and then punishes it’s users for using these features? I followed so many cool people and now I can’t even figure out how to find them again because I don’t remember their usernames and their videos aren’t in my likes.

I spent way too much time on here anyways, so I guess this is a sign. Since my account is unusable I might as well just delete it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-13T04:57:51-07:00

I had already made a different account I was just trying log back into it because I had a lot of saved/favorited videos but then it logged me out of my other account which I had already started. I was very frustrated but I thought it was a bug so I just created a new account and went on with my day. A few days later, my friend gifted me her old account even though I had made a new one after that incident, and when I tried to log into that one, it logged me out of my account. I still thought this was a bug until one week ago. I had made 2 accounts on 2 different devices and instead of flipping through them because of notifications, I was gonna sign into one of the accounts using one of the devices.

9062202510,Micay_k,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id293351031,25.9.0,1,Please fix actual problems on the app,"Recently TikTok has been rolling out a lot of really bad updates to their app. The new inbox system is really confusing and unnecessary. I have to click through a few different tabs before I can see my notifications. It’s just tedious and confusing as the “activities” tab is not immediately obvious or easy to see. The other thing that irks me is that when I’m trying to preview a video in my drafts there is now an overlay over the video that is no longer collapsible. This doesn’t make any sense at all because the point of previewing a video is so you can see what it looks like on its own without all the buttons and overlays and what have you. Now there’s a big red “post” button that cuts off the bottom half of my video so I can’t even see what’s going on. Not only does it just not make sense to have a post button in a preview window, it’s just bad design. I’m convinced TikTok is just rolling out new updates that make the user experience more complicated instead of making it better and more enjoyable. There are numerous other problems like algorithm and report system they should focus on but they keep updating things that don’t need to be fixed and ultimately make the experience on the app harder and less fun. I hope they undo these unnecessary updates before people start leaving the app in favor of something like Instagram instead.

It’s a wonderful platform to learn new information that is engaging and can even teach you new skills. I love that about this app but the one thing that I cannot and will not ever go along with is their censorship protocols and how their algorithm is trained to be extremely sensitive to look for keywords, phrases, names and places. TikTok will flag your video and remove it for a “community guidelines violation“, however, they failed to tell you which community guideline you have “violated“. Within the past year, TT updated their T&C to include a specific “community guideline“ that you “violated“. For a couple of months it was being implemented but now it has gone back to just a notification that your video was removed and one option to press one button, “appeal“. You cannot write or attach any supporting documents when appealing a video that supposedly “violated“ their community guidelines. Having easy access to information from all around the world is what average every day citizens want but that is not beneficial for the mainstream media so censorship is the “go to”. TikTok has a lot to work on regarding censorship even though they are a Chinese owned app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-18T14:22:56-07:00

But there’s a lot of details and settings that need to be fixed. These features really bring down the experience for me. For one, Every other video is in another language. I’ve checked and redone my language settings, and I’ve clicked “not interested” for every one. I’m still somehow on Russian tok or Arabic. Another small thing is the favorites tab. All your favorited videos are in the same place with one problem. You can favorite thousands and have no way of finding that one video from a couple weeks ago. The app desperately needs organization. Favorites should have a sorting feature to group videos manually. That’s a feature I’ve been praying for over the last few years. An odd thing tiktok does is review the videos you post to “only visible to me” and deletes them. It isnt right to go through personal videos not meant for the public eye. Of course I don’t mean people post explicit or inappropriate videos there, but just like drafts, as long as the video is private like that, it shouldnt be reviewed by tiktok. There’s plenty more I could list off, but i believe those are the ones that bother me the most. I hope these issues will be taken seriously and solutions will be, at the very least, considered.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-06T08:35:05-07:00

But ever since like May 2021 the app's been doing some strange things like out of nowhere people are getting their MAIN accounts with like over 10K followers banned cause of some troll accounts. Also the app has been banning people off the LIVE access because they disobeyed the community guidelines like not being able to go LIVE because they're 15 and younger (In order to go live apparently is 16 with a license). Most of the app's community is 15 and younger and the app is letting all these sexual and violent people go live and then I go on the app some of the people I see going live are like 7 year old kids playing fortnite and is getting spat on by their viewers for the game they play ""it's not the person it's the game"". Also like last week out of nowhere I've been seeing people make meme videos about the drafts button being smaller than the post button, and me trying to avoid the update actually gets the update without manually doing it. I don't see the point in that and I don't know if the app wants to think that it's a good thing. No it's pushing buttons towards other creators that think the video they just recorded wasn't good so they have to draft it.
