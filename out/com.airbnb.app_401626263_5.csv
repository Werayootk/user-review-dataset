We opted to keep it as a full credit to use in a future booking. We did a booking for December using the credit, but this also got canceled due to Covid. When I did a new booking recently, only a small portion of the credit was available. Most of it went missing because of the use and cancelation of the second booking which probably created some sort of database error. I was able to reach Acel  in Customer Support directly on the phone. After she took all the details she initiated an investigation.

My main concern is the fact that most of my lists of homes have gotten erased. I spent an extensive amount of time saving homes in many, many different areas, when I went to check back on the lists, I realized most of them had been erased...which means that I'd have to take the time to restart all of them, which would end up pointless, because other lists would end up getting erased. I'll take a guess that there is a limit of lists on the app, which I must say is bs and I would recommend you guys allow people to make as many lists as they want. I have also noticed that the search engine doesn't provide a list of related areas anymore, if you are to type in a city or place. This causes issue because now you have to weirdly specify what exact area you are talking about.

I don’t like the fee Airbnb charges both our guests and us. They have taken more than $600 from individual renters over the summer. When I called to make sure that was right, I was told the percentage they take varies from 6-15% depending on the place and time of year. It seems only fair that the percent be the same across the board. 

We must charge a county tax in addition to the nightly fee and need to give our renters our phone number to pay through PayPal. Airbnb scrambles our number and it becomes additionally hard to collect this tax. I would like for them to require the tax as an additional charge like the cleaning fee instead of having us chase after it from renters after they have already booked.

Instead, couple days later my account got instantly banned for ""safety reasons"" as she must have reported me.... after I legitimately was scared asking air bnb if I needed to call the cops to escort her out of my house. She got away with stealing from a new host, and banning my profile so that my honest 1 star review of her would never be seen. I cannot believe Air BnB let her get away with that.

My advice to all the customers and hosts, is only book for one night, then talk to the host directly about booking remaining nights directly through them. It’ll save you a lot of money. And hosts, don’t worry about your things getting stolen by letting the guest book directly. Take a picture of their ID, ask for a deposit if it makes you feel more comfortable, but guess what??? That’s what renters insurance or home insurance is for. Speak to your insurance provider and explain the situation so that you can make sure they will cover if a guest steals items, and boom, you’ll be making more money without having air bnb take 20% of your earnings.

Also, our most recent host doesn’t charge the credit card immediately, but the app says 50% due up front. I didn’t know until I was committed to the reservation whether I was paying now or later. Some things may be minor to some people but deal breakers to others. I’m a huge fan of truth in advertising.

We live in a big city so we are pretty used to getting harassed by homeless people, but this was pretty different. They kept grabbing our arms and not letting us get into our Airbnb. Neither me or my girlfriend felt safe spending the night there. So we booked a different hotel the same day and left. When I told Airbnb about my safety concerns they were not supportive at all.

So, all in all, I rate the app highly. But I had two issues with the app.
First, after rating a guest, the app leaves the user at a dead end! Two buttons, ""Got It"" and ""Take a quick survey"" but neither choice lets you leave the page when you're done! The survey page appears to overlay the app page and it has no 'close' button of its own. I have to actually kill the app each time and restart it to get out of the feedback page and continue. Annoying. It makes giving AirBnB feedback a chore.

After contacting customer service, they swiftly returned the money out of their own pockets because they saw I was a new user and wanted my first experience with them to be amazing. I was ecstatic to say the least. After the initial mess up on my part, I found a great apartment for a great price in LA. Loved my stay in a clean apartment that was hosted my a professional host. Will definitely use and recommend to people again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2018-03-24T15:11:16-07:00

The only complaint I have is that the review process closes out too quickly. I am a very busy person and have actually missed the cut off to leave a great review, which was upsetting since the host deserves a great review. I even tried contacting customer services to see if the could reopen it so I could leave the review, no luck. Please fix that issue. I need time to write a good review. Thanks. 
The pros greatly outweigh the cons on this app though. The ease of paying, searching for properties, being able to save them while searching, tracking your trips, ways to contact the hosts, giving suggestions on experiences that we could do where we are staying, are all great features.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-10T07:59:35-07:00
7632466826,Reviewing Joe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id798986101,21.29,1,Airbnb Stole My Money,"I booked a spontaneous trip. In one hour, I cancelled the trip, but because technically the booking was cancelled within 24 hours before the trip, I couldn’t get a refund. I know stupid me, but i researched the place after I booked it, and turns out, the city was in one of the most dangerous cities in America. The worst part is the owner didn’t even reply to my refund request until 4 hours after I was supposed to be at their house, so I would’ve been alone in the dark for four hours outside his house waiting for the keys in one of the most dangerous places in America. Also, Airbnb only sent me to an automated robot and made me clash it out with the host for the refund, and the host obviously wanted his free $400, so he didn’t return it. P.S. the automated robot still took a week to get back to me. Your 5 star ratings are rigged, and after years of experience and being a publicly traded company, your customer service is absolutely terrible. Please change your CEO and board of directors because clients and hosts are both not happy.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-29T12:23:01-07:00

Looks like I have 7 listings. I’m working on getting down to the two listings I do have and suggest a quick delete button If one does not have guests should be able to remove the extra listing that is on site to the Host. It is confusing. And the Big Deal is those partials cannot be deleted you have to spend hours to finish each one. The wonderful people who have tried to assist me finally told me what is not on the Airbnb site. All pictures of rooms must be in landscape mode, portraits will be on your screen but not load!  Why not tell Hosts. Save hours trying to put simple picture up???  Next you HAVE to Finish Each unfinished listing in order to Delete it!  So far in this website for 31 hours, used Help Service about 22 times because had to cut off and reconnect (they will call back) I only cried twice from the frustration.  It worked in June so far not able to get a listing and will be borrowing money I could not earn for this month!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-09T09:34:11-07:00

The first time I tried to pay for a room I attempted to use 3 different payment methods all which resulted in an error to complete booking. So today I tried again and got through that part thinking no problem just a glitch in their system but no. Then I have to upload a picture of an ID?!? Ok fine, only there was an error in uploading of course. So I had to do it again! This time it worked but now I have to take another photo to id myself?! Seems a bit ridiculous but fine. Oh but now you have to download an app!!!!!!! Then u have to upload a profile pic but of course that’s not enough to identify you now you have to take a real-time photo of yourself too. I’m done. Not sure why everyone likes Airbnb so much I can’t even get past the freaking booking process, you would think you were trying to gain access to the White House, what’s next do I need to send in my fingerprints and CV next? Sorry but no thanks, I would rather sleep in my car then ever use Airbnb.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-08T07:17:08-07:00
