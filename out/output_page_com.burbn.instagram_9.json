I have spent days unfollowing 1000 pages including models and pages that sponsor common trendy audios and edit clips. I now follow less than 1000 people, and my page feed has shifted drastically. \nNow, instagram, has decided that the other 850 people that i follow are no longer worthy of my feed and it still shows me ONLY WOMEN AND CARS. regardless if i follow them, i dont see any pages i actually do follow and my feed has become only suggested posts that get more attention on their “algorithm” from people that dont follow them already, than the people that follow the pages i do.\nThis has been the biggest downslope of changes ive seen on an app more so than it becoming unavailable.

I just don’t get what’s the point of choosing who I want follow if I am going to be force fed people’s pages to follow anyway. This would also work better if the algorithms for suggestions also functioned as it should but sadly it can’t seem to understand what I’m truly interested in on instagram. Not really innovative, just a nuisance. I love what Instagram is at the core. A place to share memories and communicate via pictures and video, don’t lose that core just to be a copy of other social media outlets out there. Focus on what you do best, with things like photo editing/tuning, multiple video/photo posting etc. Those are worthy additions that make the experience worth it!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-12-30T04:27:59-07:00"},{"id":"10688137981","userName":"ash_xo411","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id751138901","version":"311.0.0","score":3,"title":"Been with IG since the beginning- wish the algorithm was different","text":"I’ve had instagram for a VERY long time. It’s interesting to see how the app & algorithm has changed over the years. And how people have changed how they use the app (ex- it started out as following friends- now it’s about growing an online following & instead of posting one pic people post several in one post & reels/ TikTok like videos) it seems like reels get the best exposure & reach outside of your followers (if you’re trying to grow your account). Stories used to be a great feature but my story reach & engagement has GREATLY diminished over the years along with my regular posts. I wish IG would push stories and posts the way they used to. \nI do like the app- I think IG is trying to stick with the times by promoting reels and the shopping feature is cool & convenient too. I think they should focus on changing how they push stories to followers & posts to non-followers- because these are two of the main elements that Instagram are known for!

NO ONE likes this new posts out of order thing y'all got going on.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-03-28T21:00:20-07:00"},{"id":"9767481431","userName":"playafisha","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id313343848","version":"276.1","score":1,"title":"Zero support","text":"Just over a year ago my account was hacked. I no longer had control of it after over ten years. I followed every single way to contact them. I had friends report my hacked accounts. My account was private, but not after it was hacked. The hackers were posting pictures of my nephews, both under the age of ten, for their crypto scam. I followed all the suggested ways to try to reclaim my account. Pictures with my photo ID and mail and dated items. I tried contacting support through Facebook to see if I could get a connection somehow. I even emailed as many IG emails that I could find. NOT A SINGLE ACTUAL RESPONSE THAT WASN’T BOT GENERATED!! The app that brags about connecting people has zero connection to people. I was never sent any of the follow up responses other than they couldn’t identify me through my profile. Sorry I didn’t snap selfies  often enough for your automated system. I tried for a few months to recover it. And not one single bit of actual help. I honestly don’t miss the app. It was cool when I first started over a decade ago, but once Sucky Zuck took over it became instant trash. You no longer saw your friends or accounts you followed or you liked. It was a bunch of random trash that didn’t interest me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-30T04:04:34-07:00"},{"id":"5979498156","userName":"Bellhop12345","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32289701","version":"142.0","score":5,"title":"Needs better customer service","text":"I really like sharing my photos and connecting with people all over the world. What disappoints me is the apps lack of communication with you when you are having problems with functions within the app. Instagram has never replied to any of my many requests for help which is incredibly frustrating. Currently my activity portion of the app stopped working, almost a week ago, despite many attempts at fixing it myself it still does not work. You can be banned for a 24 hour period for commenting on a photo. For example, I have been banned for the comment “beautiful” on a picture of a flower.  I’ve only complimented photos, I  never write anything mean, rude or crude. Instagram never responds to any of my requests for help. If they could be more responsive to problems (better customer service) and didn’t censor kind comments I would give this app five stars. It is a great way to see other parts of the world, learn about  other cultures and find DIY videos.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-22T07:51:34-07:00"},{"id":"8760890081","userName":"homewithchris","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id109573040","version":"238.0","score":2,"title":"Content creator with promotion issue since Feb.","text":"I have had an issue where I can’t run promotions on Instagram. I have a zero balance and in fact, I have a credit I am not able to use either that expires in August. I have submitted endless amounts of tickets with the payments team and they have charged my card to test it and it works fine. I am still unable to do promotions. All it says is that an error occurred on the IG end and I am left here helpless. Promotions are the main marketing tool I use to get followers on my page and therefore results in my direct income. I have felt like giving up since no one on the payments team has been able to help me or even answer me with how to resolve this. I keep getting error messages over and over and no matter how I try to fix it, nothing works. My card is good, I have a zero balance and I have a credit on file. But still, I am unable to do any promotions for my business and no one seems to be able to fix the issue. Makes me want to give up on my business. IG has let me down. This has been happening so be early Feb. this year. \n\nI pray someday someone can take the time to see the real issue going on and fix it for me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-10T11:55:50-07:00"},{"id":"6886264141","userName":"zivie lavender","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1200998845","version":"170.0","score":1,"title":"instagram, you’re killing us step yo game up","text":"i used to genuinely love instagram. i’ve had instagram since 2015 and it was like therapy for me. but with each update, it just gets worse and worse. \n𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙘 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙧  so first off, my music sticker just gives me random options of ppl i have never heard of before and when i look up anybody like Ariana, Joji, Melanie, nothing shows up. i have tried everything. deleting instagram and getting it back, switching from a business account to a personal, and nothing has worked. i’m tired of seeing bald men when i tap on my music sticker.\n𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙖𝙫𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙖𝙗  i save a lot of things on instagram. it’s really helpful for me. but now none of it will load. i’ve done everything you can think of and it just won’t work. for example, i have a saved tab just for memes. i can see the tab but when i press on it, it says it’s loading then after a minute of it, it says it can’t load. it makes no sense.\n𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙩  it. just. gets. worst. it’s so unnecessary. the shopping tab shouldn’t even be where it is. a lotta ppl don’t even shop on insta. instagram is just getting so lazy at this point. do these ppl want us to delete the app? it’s so obvious everyone is tired of this.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-01-18T15:22:09-07:00"},{"id":"2138466898","userName":"Opp29","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id281835058","version":"29.0","score":5,"title":"This app gets worse and worse","text":"Instagram is getting worse and worse with each update. Ever since FB bought Instagram it has gone downhill. They are no longer coming up new ideas. Like Insta stories. COME ON! That is a clear pull off of Snapchat. Also with the search directory. It used to be really nice but now it is very frustrating because whenever you tap on one photo you only get related photos instead of a variety of things that interest you. Plus with the new “relevant feed” it shows stuff that is totally IRRELEVANT! I personally only see ads and horrible memes (don’t get me wrong I love memes but these are pure trash). It also will show you photos and videos from weeks ago that when you like them (not checking to see when it was posted because that is too much work, and this is a social media platform and not a job) the people you follow will get weirded out. That is at least what happens to a significant amount of people. To summarize this Instagram needs to become more original and less recycled.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-01-28T18:01:09-07:00"},{"id":"5082138505","userName":"Rokolor","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id111298647","version":"113.0","score":1,"title":"New picture messaging feature needs work","text":"Instagram hasn't changed that much in the years I've used it but recently they've introduced a Snapchat like feature where you can send picture messages with text, basically the same thing as Snapchat. I like the Instagram system better though, because the messaging interface has a feature whereby you can incorporate someone's picture message into your reply. It appears as a little thumbnail version of the image they sent you, kind of like the little thumbnail you see when you're facetiming someone. This is really a great feature because it helps to organize the conversation and that way you can remember what is being said. Sadly the system has a really annoying bug that is seemingly completely random in its timing. The issue is pretty simple: a lot of times the text that you write on the picture doesn't appear on the other persons screen when they receive the message. So basically there is no message. This happens usually when replying and incorporating the other persons image into your own but it also happens on standalone messages. Very very annoying and has killed many conversations. I really hope this gets fixed because if it does I'll pretty much ditch Snapchat altogether.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-11-03T16:27:42-07:00"},{"id":"3831032842","userName":"Naija Williams","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id574526290","version":"82.0","score":2,"title":"New ugly update","text":"This new update is but ugly and disgusting and I don’t like it and I would like you to change it back not being able to see how many pics in was a dumb thing to take away making it look like that was a dumb thing to do and u need to get new people on ur design team because the things ur making are ugly and usually some times confusing especially when you update the settings a while back putting everything together like that was confusing.

I have also reported this issue many times in hopes of instagram's feedback. And i have NEVER gotten any response on this problem an not once have seen instagram acknowledge this problem that many people are struggling with. I am also concerned as to why i am able to have this update on my other account and not my mainly used account. Many people have this as-well. I feel very left out and as-well as many other people. This is truly rude on how many of us have to struggle to have no answers onto why we do not have this update that many other people around us already have received.

It’s as if it didn’t occur to instagram that users who have accounts for pleasure or for fun would want control of when or how they post. And there’s no justification why creators can’t auto post. I had resisted instagram for a while, but had decided to create a hobby page on instagram. But I was so incredibly frustrated by trying to get third party app to schedule posts (I had to set my account to a business account, create a Facebook account, Facebook then blocked my account for no reason), that I had to drop the project altogether.\n\nThe app is so user unfriendly that I’m amazed it still has a user base. It’s clear as time passes, more and more young people will select other apps, as instagram intentionally makes its app user unfriendly. It makes me think that Meta needs to think long and hard about their strategy, as alienating potential users is not going to help the fact that they’re struggling to increase their user base.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-26T14:22:54-07:00"}]
