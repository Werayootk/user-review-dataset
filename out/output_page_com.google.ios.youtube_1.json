I have found channels that I now follow thanks to the “if you liked that, try this” function. Hence the 3 stars… but\n\nI will admit that the “algorithm” has been a bit unkind to some of the channels I follow. Blocking content for arbitrary reasons, being slow or downright unresponsive in the customer service department, and changing its own rules on what is and isn’t allowed at the drop of a hat. Now maybe YT’s rules are changing internally, but there needs to be consistency in them, and from what I’ve seen there isn’t.\n\nAlso, as I am a bit of an Odd Duck, I prefer to keep my watch history neat. If I accidentally click something, or don’t want the algorithm to start recommending things based on a passing interest, I delete this from my watch history.

Of course, there are a few things that I would like however.\n\nDefinitely removing dislikes is something the community says. (My review might be discorded automatically since I said that) If this hurts the small creators, you can add a feature where dislikes can be toggled to be seen by the creator, but the community can see the dislikes no matter what. That would solve the problem of small creators being protected.\n\nWhat thing I would like personally is mature rating. Somewhat similar to most streaming entertainment service companies such as Nexflix, a maturity rating could be nice. However, DONT restrict shows at certain ratings. Just tells the viewer what would they expect.\n\nFinally, I feel like channels with a lot of subscribers (amount at your discretion) should have more freedom to move around. For example, higher viewed channel can get more copyright strikes(p.s this might save automatic unreasonable copyright strikes from getting channels terminated.) If small channels get protected, why can’t the big ones too? They have been trusted to build a fan base over the years.\n\nFinally, this might not happen, but maybe we could choose what type of ads we want to watch. Maybe I enjoy game ads. Maybe I enjoy Morgan and Morgan ads.

In my opinion, removing the ability to see the number of dislikes on a video is harmful and a major blow to this platform’s integrity. The like-to-dislike ratio was so often used as a quick eye test and a tool to judge a content creator’s credibility and the amount of effort and value that went into the production of any particular video.

And I hate how I have to worry about my niece stumbling upon two anime girls talking about sex because you automatically decided all animation is for kids.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-07-19T00:51:10-07:00"},{"id":"9834557041","userName":"jd the lady","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1362540533","version":"18.15.1","score":5,"title":"The rfycggc","text":"I kkhuse a timer for a t and then it goes to o then the alarm is gone for a few uuioopp minutes so it goes off again but then it goes back to the alarm and then it goes off and then it starts going back on and it just starts again so it’s a one off and it’s just like that I think I need it back again I just want the clock out so that it’s going off so it keeps coming up so it’s going off but I can hear the clock out but it doesn’t start off and it just goes back to normal tyyt wwweeewww I don’t know why I don’t have time I just don’t know why it doesn’t even have time I have no time I have nothing but time is it just keeps going off and it doesn’t start going on for like I just want it doesn’t even start to work for me I just don’t want it doesn’t work like it just doesn’t even know how long I just don’t understand what it is and ythen it doesn’t even","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-18T04:06:18-07:00"},{"id":"10452990956","userName":"theflurry1234","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1410500396","version":"18.39.1","score":5,"title":"If you think this has issues on your phone here’s you should watch on✅","text":"I see lots of issues on reviews on phones but if you reading this computer you could watch on but sometime if you watch on tv it could get annoying because you have to press the buttons on the remote it get annoying a little annoying but I would watch on pc but unless your phone is fine with no issues but a lot of people says they have issues on phone but the tv to type with remote is annoying because it’s really slow but on your computer you can type fast since you have a keyboard (unless you don’t have a computer or laptop) but you don’t have a computer you may have to watch on phone or tv if you don’t have a computer but you do have one you can watch one it \n\nI was trying to help btw if you have issues on your phone","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-08T10:25:05-07:00"},{"id":"10273840491","userName":"BeeLond","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1405317712","version":"18.32.2","score":1,"title":"I pay for premium but cant change default resolution","text":"I get streaming 4k is more expensive than 1080p or 720p, but I pay for premium so when I go to the settings to see why my videos look like hazy garbage, I’m frustrated that as a premium subscriber I cannot set the default to a specific resolution. Sure it says I set it for “higher picture quality.” But for the last 6 months that higher picture quality, regardless of my internet speed (home or cellular) is 720p or lower. And it’s instantly noticeable. When I manually select a resolution in the video I’m watching, it streams no problem at 1440p or 4k, but the next video defaults back to “higher quality” aka 720p garbage. This cost saving measure is a slap in the face for anyone paying the “premium” fee. And as a cost saving measure, I guarantee if they bury the setting to choose highest available quality - the average 90% of users paying for premium won’t ever touch it, but for the 10% of us sensitive to lower resolutions, give us the choice back Google!

I used to enjoy Utube but after the virus you had to label every video that doesn’t fit your narrative with some statement as if people didn’t have access to information any other way. Then you demonized several channels with thousands of followers because you want the control of telling people how and what to think. Then channels get lost in the algorithm because you don’t agree with their platform or what they say because it might hurt someone’s feelings. If a channel bothers someone they don’t have to watch it by the way. You took many off of the platform because you can’t handle people viewing any opinions based on actual factual information that is sourced. You make porn so accessible that kids can find it yet you block ideas that are just out of your comfort zone- hypocrite. Now you make everyone agree to disregard their own privacy and give their private information to any source you like because of your new sign in policy. You are a narcissistic app wanting complete power and control of all information.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-16T12:21:28-07:00"},{"id":"6576809741","userName":"David Wonn","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id307973224","version":"15.43.4","score":3,"title":"Comment Likes no longer go up. Fix it!","text":"It took a while of seemingly endless update loops but the app finally finished an update. So far, some issues seem to be addressed, such as an active video in the lower right obscuring the ability to tap the 3 dots to the right of some videos at the end of long lists, such as Watch Later history and so on.\n\nUpon further review, the Videos tab on every channel is blank, regardless of how you sort. That’s a MAJOR bug. [Edit: They have since fixed this, so I’ll bump up the rating.]\n\nI like having the new ability to view replies to my comments on other videos without interrupting watching an unrelated video. I also like the addition of ¾ and 1¾ speed multipliers on videos.\n\nUnfortunately some videos now get paused when moved to the lower right corner, though this behavior is inconsistent. Also I’ve seen delays on comments in live streams going as far as nine (9!) minutes with only a few hundred or so people in chat. Also I have my fonts magnified due to poor vision, and for some reason, bold text in comments on videos is unusually small.\n\nSo with the forced update, some things improved, and some didn’t.\n\nUpdate 10/26: This app routinely removes my likes on comments shortly afterward. I remove the like and re-like it, and the counter is fixed, then it decrements. It is so obvious when I’m the only one who liked someone’s comment, only to see the number \"1\" vanish shortly afterward.

I have to swipe out of my player, to my watchlist to remove the video that I just watched. But when I do that, I am scrolled to a random location somewhere in the middle of my list where I have to scroll up and down to find the video that I just watched, in order to remove it from the list. I believe this is an issue with any/all playlists. The watchlist used to always have a shortcut on the Home Screen. But now it is dependent on how recently it was accessed. This can be frustrating when you have to scroll all the way down to the ‘W’s in order to find ‘Watchlist’.\nWhen saving to a playlist, the order is not alphabetical, but recent.

And don’t get me started with how broken their ad system is, and how they only care about making that $ and not monitoring what gets advertised on their platform, Really ironic that they get so angry at creators for not being “family friendly” but the ads are way worse and just plain disgusting. Other than that though i am on here daily\n\nEdit: wrote this review months ago. Not only have the issues I’ve experienced not gone away, but now there’s even more issues. 5% of the time the Skip ad timer doesn’t count properly and i need to close my video (yes even if its an ad in the middle of the video). Sometimes the video just pauses and doesn’t unpause until you double tap to rewind 10 seconds, only it rewinds about 2 minutes because the video timer stopped working.  I have lower end internet and it forces me into 480p even though 720p works just fine, every single video and i need to manually change it to 720p. Its a stupid new system they decided to make to make this already broken app somehow even worse.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-19T23:14:55-07:00"}]
