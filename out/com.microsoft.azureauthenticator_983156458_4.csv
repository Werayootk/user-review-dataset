But it’s very limited. I cannot reorder entries. I cannot edit the second line of the entry description. PayPal and LinkedIn entries conflict when I import them from andOTP using QR codes. Both are tied to my email and override each other. It’s a decent app for a handful of entries, but once you start using 2FA everywhere, it becomes inadequate.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-08T22:58:24-07:00

I’ve had 5 (that’s FIVE) MS Authenticators stolen from me. It wouldn’t be so bad really if only they didn’t steal my backups too.

This is the way every Microsoft product works for me. I don’t know if I’ve been hacked I don’t know if Microsoft hates my guts.

After restoring the phone, much to my dismay, I login to the MS app, do a restore and all it did was restore my MS account associated with the backup. The handful of other codes I had backed up are all gone and the latest back up is now dated today. 

Ironically, the codes I had in Google and Authy are all still there without having had to do anything. What a pain. 😫

I had been trying to decide between Authy and MS for a while now. This finally made up my mind. Thankfully I had more than half my codes in Authy and have backup codes for my accounts. 

The only thing I’ll be using this for is the two MS accounts I have and unlocking my OnrDrive vault.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-17T12:02:49-07:00
