The only reason I am writing this review is to tell people that what they are saying about it is not true and lies. First of all you have to wait ( like 5-20 min ) to get back in a game because you have left a game to much they are trying to prevent you from being one of those people that join a game just to leave. I know that might be frustrating but they are trying to make your experience better so stop complaining it could be much worse. The second thing I would like to address is that all the people are saying ‚Äú I barley moved an inch and they said orange vented,‚Äù well I am sorry to break it to you people are like that and they are just guessing to try to get you out so don‚Äôt complain. The last thing i want to address is people are saying they can‚Äôt get into the game because it is full even though it is 1/10. Well think about it there are millions of people trying to get into a game so they pick a game quick. My overall opinion of the game is great because there are no adds, it is just fun, you have weird and colorful skins, you can join publicly or private with your friends, there is democracy, and you get to chat.  ( i understand sometimes the chats can be inappropriate but then just leave the game) I did 4 stars because no game is perfect and there is minor glitching with colors but that‚Äôs really it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-27T20:29:09-07:00

It‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the most popular games out there, just behind Roblox and Minecraft. I play on an iPad, as does my family and friends. The newest update is amazing! However, ever since the update it has taken me a while to join a game. I will click on games with only 5 players in it, and it will say it‚Äôs full. I can handle a couple of those, but 10 minutes worth of that?!? Sure, some say ‚ÄòThe game has already started.‚Äô But most say it‚Äôs full when in reality there‚Äôs only a couple players online. Please fix fast! I am an avid player and it is really annoying to have to go through this!
UPDATE/EDIT: Just got the brand-new Airship update.... and am not a fan. I'm actually disappointed, because
1. The age limit is annoying. I feel like yes, it's necessary but it's an absolute PAIN. I feel like you should make your inappropriate-screening should be fixed and made better, and you should lower the age limit to at lease twelve.
2. The hats..... also, annoying. There aren't that many and they aren't as high quality as the rest.
3. The map.... it's very difficult to navigate. In any other map, little bubbles or notifications pop up in the area you have tasks, but not in this. The ladders and moving pads are a great idea, but are (again) extremely difficult to move around the map with.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-02T07:31:19-07:00

But then a update came and it ruined everything. Everyone hates quick chat because it‚Äôs so hard to find what you want to say and people have voted me out for not talking because of quick chat. Please fix this. This is the reason why I quit/deleted this game it was so fun with free chat but then yeah I just hate that I can‚Äôt even type. For example I was playing a game and I saw pink kill blue but then after pink killed blue he left. So then I couldn‚Äôt say who pink killed and they voted me out. Pink won as the imposter I was was mad. So please remove quick chat no one likes it I don‚Äôt even know why you added this nonsense! One time me and my friend played among us and my friend saw orange kill and they voted her out! Then on the next round I said that orange killed but no one believed me! I also want you to remove emergency meetings. Why do we have them? One time I accidentally shape shifted as a imposter and lime green saw me and called a emergency meeting! They voted me out! Also another time I showed everyone my med bay scan and then purple called a emergency meeting and said I was the imposter! And I scanned right in front of him! Has that person lost their mind?

Doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal, yeah, but when there‚Äôs absolutely nothing you can do about it‚Äôs quite obnoxious and frustrating. I stay in a dorm so of course I don‚Äôt have presidential Wi-Fi or anything, but this hasn‚Äôt always been a problem. I 100% understand and encourage actions taken to prevent cheating, but it‚Äôs ineffective when it disrupts you‚Äôre player base, those who enjoy to play the game fairly. Almost everyone I have encountered and addressed this issue with has been experiencing the same problem. I‚Äôve been patient and hoped these bugs might get fixed, but as the title suggests, I‚Äôm too impatient to play a game and a half just to wait 2 hours to try and play another. If anyone would like to criticize my credibility on this issue, be my guest, but I‚Äôm simply just a player who used to and would still like to enjoy the game. I have taken screenshots of the error message I receive once I‚Äôm removed from a game just in case it‚Äôs suspected I am trying to cheat or exit the app. By all means this review isn‚Äôt spoken for everyone, but if you have history of moderate to poor network connection (even if it‚Äôs worked thus far) be warned.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-10T19:41:07-07:00

I just played a game and someone named ‚ÄúPink‚Äù was the imposter (they were the black color) and so I said ‚Äúvote Pink‚Äù and low and behold, pink (the color their name was soso) was voted out. It is SO AGGRAVATING. Without the new quick chat feature this game would earn a 5/5 stars from me but it bumps it down to a 1/5 stars. Please remove this feature or at least make it available for people who are not 18+. Most people who play are high schoolers younger than 18, including me. Please make the quick chat feature not a thing anymore, among us was perfectly fine without it. I will not be playing anymore until the chat is fixed. Nobody likes it. I just read the reviews. Fix the chat and we will all be happy. Saying bye to among us until this is fixed, An annoyed Among Us player

So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn‚Äôt even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now.

But this one day, it said I was banned due to some unsportsmanlike conduct, and said that I was banned for a whole week! I thought that was because I got mad over losing some random game, which it most likely was. But I still got mad because some other people were being mean to me and made me mad! But I waited until the whole week was up. But when I finally decide to play among us again, it said I was still banned for bullying! For about 3 weeks and two days this time! That‚Äôs about a whole month of being banned from among us! I then decided, why play some stupid game that won‚Äôt even let me play it? The game is dead anyways! And my life is perfect without it! But I‚Äôm having some doubts about it, and I really don‚Äôt want to be banned anymore! And over time, I have been taking anger management classes trying to change my ways.

Here are 3 cases where I have encountered serious hacking. 1. There was a time where I joined a room and red kept being the impostor every time. They could walk through walls and every time I called a meeting to report them the second I touched it they would sabotage and kill me. I tried to confront them and every time they insisted they weren‚Äôt hacking. 2. One time I joined a room and when the game started the cafeteria doors closed so everyone was stuck. The doors never opened so you could only call a meeting. Because everyone was there people accused random people until we found who it was...........after 20 games! 3. This one is one many people have been talking about. There is the infamous user known as eriesloris who keeps coming into servers and spamming messages that are either: subscribe to his channel, join his discord, or say the game is boring and give people a link to use hacks. I have encountered him like 4 times and I always know it‚Äôs him because of the messages and he always joins whith a teal green color and the name ???.

I know you work very hard to update this game so feel free to pick the easiest one.                        Friends list: if you played among us with a person you liked a lot to play with you could send them a friend request. If they accept they would go to your friends list and you can join them in games (you will join as a ghost).            Game modes: I play this game on mobile so I am not sure if you added this already but if there were game modes in the menu where you can look for games, there would be a game mode area and if you hosted a game, you could decide the game mode.         Imposter chance: I thought each time you play a game, when you are in the lobby (dropship) it would show your imposter chance. This way people who quit the game when they are not the imposter, when they join another game their imposter chance would stay the same because they did not play the round.   New kill animations: playing among us is fun but it gets kind of boring each time you get killed it gets boring seeing the knife kill or gun kill so maybe you could add more kill animations.             These were all my suggestions so I hope you add one of these if you have time.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game.
 
But then I tried public games.

It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

But I like that it‚Äôs original and easy, but requires you to actually use your brain. It‚Äôs a fun, interactive game. The last thing I have to complain about happens AFTER the round is over. Sometimes it stays on s black screen and doesn‚Äôt do anything. I waited for a long time as an experiment, it doesn‚Äôt load. You have to close the game completely then open it back up. Then find a new server just to have it happen again. I mean what the heck. That‚Äôs all u have to complain about. Overall, I‚Äôd give it 9/10 but there is only 5 stars so, just four.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-10T12:28:04-07:00

Since she had never played, when someone who was an engineer vented she pressed the emergency meeting button. (I had told her the rule basics but forgot about all the roles.) In the chat everyone ganged up on her calling her stupid, dumb, a kid, and cussing about her. And when she said they were being mean one of them chatted back that they didn‚Äôt care. She ran to me crying about how mean all those people were. Of course i got angry and wrote back to them about how they made a nine year old cry. They called me crazy and to tell u the truth it stung a little. After that I handed my phone back to her she played with those people for five minutes before saying that she stopped playing because they left her out. Then I looked for another group and asked them to be nice and they were. She said it was fun but she ran back up to her room crying about how she ‚Äúnever wants to play that bad game again.‚Äù Among Us creators please make a bully free platform.

Another encounter is that the imposter ended the voting time and we couldn‚Äôt vote him off. I would be happy if u ban the devices of those cheaters if possible. 4. Advantages: I would like to play among us on pc but I can‚Äôt cause I don‚Äôt own a pc or laptop.

The main issue I have is with disconnecting from servers or the app crashing. And both are CONSTANT!

Sometimes the game will shut my room down due to ‚Äúinactivity‚Äù despite constant chatting and people coming in & out, especially because it takes FOREVER to fill a room. On top of that, I‚Äôm constantly getting a pop up when I disconnect saying I have an older version of the game, even though no update is available. 
To the creators of among us- GET IT TOGETHER! You KNOW this is the most popular game on the market right now, so please stop ignoring these issues and make the effort to fix them. These issues are so constant that it makes me not want to play anymore, and I‚Äôve talked to many others that feel the same way. Just because everyone loves the game doesn‚Äôt mean people won‚Äôt start hating it because of the big persistent issues we all face multiple times in one sitting.

I turn 18 in a few months and I hate the fact that I cannot type it is annoying, yes I understand that it is for younger kids playing the game. I think that it is mostly based off of fake birthdays because people wanna be able to chat like normal. So maybe looking into a kids version of the game would be a good idea and have it for 10 and younger and have the original game for 11 and older because yes I find it very annoying that I cannot type like normal. Once I got voted off because it took me 30 seconds to find the phrase I was looking for.

Another thing is, there is a glitch, I was playing among us.. and then I saw someone dark green (normal for me) but when we got into game, I saw another dark green with the name ??? And it was not a lime, and you can have two dark greens! He kept going around in admin, I thought it was a glitch but when I called a emergency meeting, no one else saw him!

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

This time, I want to express my disappointment of how the update turned out. To be frank, I did like the implement of friend‚Äôs lists. I was initially disappointed that they fixed the glitch involving head start and glitch kill, but then, I understood the reasons why they fixed it. These were because of how broken and overpowered these glitches had. Players would often exploit these glitches to gain unfair advantages. Therefore, I let it slide.

The main problem I have with this update, primarily, is when I try to get to join public lobbies, I get a pop up saying ‚ÄúThe Among Us Servers could not authenticate you. You Must have an Among Us account to play online.‚Äù This prevents me from playing other public lobbies frequently and I do already have Among Us account. It is very frustrating experiencing this issue where I cannot join public lobbies because of this pop up claim saying it did not authenticate me and I must have an Among Us account which I already have.

 Therefore, I lowered it to 2 stars. The reason is that I see a good potential of implementing friend‚Äôs lists and getting rid of glitches like head start and glitch kill to make the game balanced. But these often get soured by a issue of a pop up that is stopping me from joining public lobbies. I will bring it back up to 4 or 5 stars if they actually decides to fix this pop up issue.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-21T18:26:42-07:00

6563705307,TOHnub,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id988395845,2020.9.9,5,Great game! I have 2 suggestions,"Not gonna lie this is an amazing game lots of fun gameplay I would recommend it 100% don‚Äôt have the game? What are you waiting for download it! but I have some suggestions maybe after like each game you get coins if you win as imposter or crewmate and once you get like a certain amount of coins you can buy power ups! Here‚Äôs a few ideas: (for imposter) being able to make the task bar after ‚Äúdoing a task‚Äù you can make the task bar go up so people don‚Äôt think your faking tasks, and to be able to turn invisible so crew mates can‚Äôt see you so they don‚Äôt know if there going to die though sometimes that will be annoying because if you die randomly by the imposter. (Crew mate) being able to turn invincible or invisible so imposters cant see you or attack you though you can still be voted off if your being sus. And my second suggestion is adding voice chat. Sometimes people are suspicious of people that are inno and cant explain well enough me for example. And other people sometimes can‚Äôt type fats enough on a small device if there on one and you will be auto muted once the game has started and at voting will be able to mute and unmute at will.

I accidentally clicked randomize name and now I can‚Äôt change my name back. My original name was Phantom. Now it‚Äôs Deedee. I like the new map tho. My friend could not change his name either. So if not being able to change ur name is part of the update then I would really like it to make it so u can do that. The game was just fine. I liked the first version before the update. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the ‚Äúquick chat ‚Äú . Yeah it‚Äôs not quicker, it‚Äôs waaay slower! I mean come on! I can not count how many times that I have gotten defeat because people couldn‚Äôt communicate with the quick chat and got voted out. It‚Äôs a guaranteed way for the imposter to win. Even if I‚Äôm imposter, I can‚Äôt defend myself from accusations because I can‚Äôt find where everything is. If quick chat stays then there should be a lot more options. A few examples are afk, wanna team, what, and if someone leaves you should still be able to say their name. Rather then have to say ‚ÄúI saw Deedee vent‚Äù you should be able to say ‚ÄúI saw Yellow vent‚Äù I like the new colors, task, and the airship, but not quick chat. Also, can you make it so you don‚Äôt need an account to remove quick chat. There was nothing wrong with the free chat. If it‚Äôs not broken don‚Äôt fix it!

I would go about playing the game like usual but I started seeing a lot of videos and hear people talking about this new cool Among Us update. I got really excited yet I wasn‚Äôt able to update the game yet. This didn‚Äôt really worry me because this usually happens. I almost always am not able to get updates for a little bit. So I would just keep playing the game. But then I started getting this thing that would say I can‚Äôt join a server because I needed the same game version. So I would just join a different server. This went on for months. Now I can‚Äôt even play the game because I need to update it. But it won‚Äôt let me. Sometimes I can press the update button but it wants me to download an older version of the game. I try to do this but it just loads and says it again. I go online and try to search up why this happens, how to fix it, or other ways to update the game. It never works. I don‚Äôt know if this is happening to anyone else but I would like to know that I‚Äôm not the only one. If anyone knows what is wrong or what I can do, then I would really appreciate it if you could tell me in some way.

The whole idea of the game is so cool and unique. I just have a few ideas to make it even better!
So, first of all, I was thinking maybe you could add some ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù colors to the game, and you could purchase them with real money. Like rainbow and colors with patterns like polka dots and stars! 
Second, a lot of people like to play things like hide and seek, so maybe you guys could add some maps made just for these kinds of things. Like, a hide and seek map, maybe a color wars map, and some cool others.
And, I‚Äôve seen some other people talking about this, mini games! If you are playing somewhere with no internet, you obviously can‚Äôt play, since you wouldn‚Äôt be able to play with players worldwide, which is what the game is about, or you know that you don‚Äôt have time to play a whole round, instead of just doing free play (which is starting to get kind of boring), you could add some fun mini games that don‚Äôt require other players. 
I hope you all at InnerSloth can add these ideas into the game, but if it‚Äôs a little too much to ask, I completely understand. :) Thank you so much for reading!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-06T19:07:50-07:00

If you like fun murder mystery games then this is the game for you! But he warned that the game got hacked and it‚Äôs not completely fixed yet I don‚Äôt think. So for now just play with your friends on a private game. Also a suggestion: People should have a limit of when they watch the security cams because otherwise it isn‚Äôt fair to the impostor . The security cams make it very hard for the impostor to win. Other than that, the game is perfect so definitely go check it out!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: The hacks are fixed but the lobbies are toxic and weird and gross. And when I finally get onto a server that isn‚Äôt full, the people in the game are really mean. I also hate that people are using Discord to cheat when they play. That ruins the experience for everyone else. I think y‚Äôall should ban people who use Discord on public games. Y‚Äôall should also add friend request options. I found a really nice person in my lobby and I wanted to play with them again but since there is no friend request option, I needed dIScoRd to hang out with them and i don‚Äôt have dIScoRd so I probably will never get to hang out with that nice person again until my parents let me get dIScoRd.

Second of all, I absolutely LOVE the new roles, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they make the game super hard for crew mates and imposters. For the shapeshifter, it mixes EVERYBODY up on who is who. For the engineer, it breaks a lot for me and even when it works, people sus you out for venting. You don‚Äôt release how many times I‚Äôve been an engineer and vented, and when I come out of the vent I have the option for a kill button. The scientist role is bull crap.

I deleted it a few months ago because I just got bored with it. Then I remembered that they released the new update with the new map. So I tried it again. When I first redownloaded it I was amazed because you could create an account and all of that jazz. I really liked the new map it was a little bit more confusing but also really fun. However I started noticing things I didn‚Äôt like. Such as I would be in the middle of a game and suddenly I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move. The joystick would move but the character would not. So I closed out the app and tried again. Still had the same issue, then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still had the same issue. Another thing I don‚Äôt particularly care for is the chat blocker. Seeing as I was really new to the map I was trying to message a friend I was playing with about where each thing was and I couldn‚Äôt type out my questions. I understand the need for some type of chat censorship because I remember what the chats were like before I just wish we had the ability to type out our own questions.

6785906166,ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! :(,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id746876469,2020.11.17,5,"Awesome game, but....","This game is so fun to play in general. I love to get into lobbies with my friends and competitively play, and even troll every once in a while. However, I have some complaints and suggestions.
     First, I would like to mention that sometimes there is this glitch where it will not let you join a game. It tells you that ‚Äúthe game is full‚Äù or ‚Äúthis game has already started‚Äù as you rage about the fact that it told you there was just one player in the lobby. At first, I thought that it was my phone or my internet, but some friends have  experienced the same issue with quicker WiFi and/or better devices than what I‚Äôm playing on. I would have a much better experience if this was fixed. 
     And now for the suggestions. I love this game and it is addictive, but I think that it would be more fun if you made other versions. Kind of like how they have LTMs in fortnite. I just think it would be fun if you were still playing the same game, but a different version. I have some ideas such as; bigger lobbies, a duel type of thing, already set up hide and seek. I just feel that this would make the game much better, and attract more people to play the game. Keep in mind that I am not trying to hate or anything.

You could play by yourself! You could... HONESTLY. I just think there should be more players allowed in a game and more hat choices. And a friend option is really needed. I also don‚Äôt like how you can‚Äôt make your name nothing. The glitch doesn‚Äôt work anymore! :( i loved that glitch. One of my favorite glitches. I also don‚Äôt like how there is only allowed 10 players in the game but there is 12 colors. Makes no sense, but I like it! One of my friends works at Autodesk, Novi and they made a website called Tinkercad where you can design anything really using the shapes and all. I think you should be able to go on Tinkercad and design a hat. You can also make things public and private in Tinkercad so other people can see your stuff and I think it would be cool if you could get Impostor a lot with the cyan color. I just think my friend gets impostor way too much and I barely ever do, but otherwise, Among Us is The best game of 2020. And you can play with your friends???

I love it so much it is so fun to play and like some other sides it does not really drain your battery on your phone tablet or computer. But the only thing is if you want a pet or skins or new hats you will have to buy them for two dollars but overall you should really download this Game. But the last thing is that you will need Internet connection to play. Last thing before you stop reading this is that honestly I love this game and I love being a imposter  it‚Äôs super fun I really recommend this game. Like I said in the title there is one recommendation if you do download this app I recommend maybe don‚Äôt make it  cost five bucks I love this game but I don‚Äôt want to spend five bucks on a game overall besides the five dollars and having to buy stuff this is a really good game but also like in some other comments I would recommend not having so much updates and having this be a safer out so you don‚Äôt have to get kicked out for either an update to version or because you could get hacked and I would also recommend maybe being able to have more players in a game then just 10 people because it‚Äôs Probably gonna be more fun with more people in the game.
