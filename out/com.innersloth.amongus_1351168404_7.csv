Just recently I tried to play the game and I hit online and yes I know for some people they can‚Äôt play online but that‚Äôs really the only fun option on this game. I hit the online button and it went to the screen where you click host, private, or public. I clicked on public, but it said you have disconnected from this server, try again later. Although it did say to check my internet connection, I had full bars. Another thing is, when I didn‚Äôt like the game I was on, I left the game. When I tried to hit public again, it just said, you need to wait 18 mins before playing because of unintentionally leaving a game. At this point I was really mad so I got on roblox. That‚Äôs about all the bad stuff on my end, but I do like lots of things. I love the new roles, it gets rid of the same old crew mate or imposter. Another thing I like about it is the new customization thing, and all the other tiny things in this latest update, keep this game great.

I absolutely love this game but I wish they can do something about the new update. I understand how people can say very inappropriate things and also have inappropriate names but i believe its unfair for people who just want to play. I am fine with quick chat but i wish they add more options that are very specific like a normal person would- also letting us make our own names again. I love the name randomizer as there are some funny names i had a small laugh at. I feel like the biggest part of among us was communicating with others.I loved joking around with the other players and having such a great time with them. But now it‚Äôs almost robot-like. I appreciate the effort the programers put into the app and hopefully will listen to our pleas (as there are others with the same opinion) and make a few small updates :) 
But overall, among us is a great game to play with friends and strangers. Me and my family/friends love to play with each other for laughs. The game has amazing graphics and gameplay with very little flaws. It is extremely fun for most ages and i suggest that you should play too.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-03T18:30:32-07:00

There is a few annoying things though. Say some host bans you after a game for winning as an imposter or winning as crew-mate when they were imposter. Another thing, sometimes I am my main color (black) and somebody else joins and wants black. I say no, because I had it first, and they must be friends with the host or something, because 5 seconds later I get banned for being black. It is so annoying! I know you can‚Äôt change this, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Another thing is, you should be able to report discord cheaters or hackers, because they make the game really unfair and defeat the purpose of the game, which is to find out the imposter(s). Enough with the negative, let‚Äôs talk about the positive stuff. This game is amazing in almost all ways, and I love it! I love how you can customize your game settings, and join others‚Äô games. You can also choose how many imposters you want. I prefer two, as with 3, the imposters win immediately and with one, the imposter is under a lot of pressure because of how many people they have to kill. 
Anyway, have a good Christmas!

This is just to bring up a tedious problem I encountered when playing Among Us. Firstly, I get many server errors a lot of the time and I don‚Äôt think it is on my end. That is not the major problem I‚Äôm going to discuss here. One problem that I came about just recently is that I get disconnected from matches mid game. The tedious part about this is that when I try to enter a new match, there is a message saying that I can‚Äôt join another game for 5 minutes because of intentionally leading. This is a major problem that prevents me from enjoying the game.

Also, task bars give away the impostor easily. If the crew wanted to, they could ask each person to do a task. The impostors would easily be caught bc of this. I believe that the reason why impostors should be caught is through deduction, not visually seeing that someone faked a task. The task bar makes the game so much worse this way. It is too easy to prove someone a crewmate or another person an impostor by looking at the task bar. This is why the task bar should be removed from among us :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-24T15:16:27-07:00

I keep getting kicked from the game with a notification that says ‚ÄúSent 6 pings that the remote has not responded to‚Äù or something like that. I also get kicked with a notification saying I‚Äôm playing an old version of Among Us but I see no available updates. Fixing the issue of being able to click already full servers would be helpful, as well as doing something about when people leave a game and it ending instantly. Some other suggestions that I want to offer is that when someone is typing in the chat, it could show which color is currently typing using ellipses ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù , kind of like what snapchat does with bitmojis. This way people know that the person is formulating a response and not just ignoring the question. Maybe even implementing voice chat in the future? Another suggestion is to start saving a score board of people who have the most kills as imposter, and recognition of other achievements in the game. There are a lot of good ideas that can stem from such a simple game, like making a realistic first-person version and even a VR version.

So once I got on the main screen I clicked online and then I wanted to join a game so when I did it automatically kicked me out and I tried this like 3 more times and it continued to keep kicking me out.

See I don‚Äôt know if some of the lagging was towards my phone because I have a 5s, and the 5s is a pretty old phone and tends to lag a lot. But to be honest I think it‚Äôs mostly the games fault for kicking me out. But I have seen a bunch of youtubers play this game and it looks really fun. My friend also has this game as well.

(Go to bottom for rate) I‚Äôve seen all the new updates and fun activities but one thing I think you should add more activities and features for crew mates that don‚Äôt have stars. Like the newest feature is only for stars and although the company wants money, it just isn‚Äôt as fun for people with out stars to enjoy new updates and activities. My sister doesn‚Äôt have stars and she‚Äôs been wearing the oldest outfits ever just bc there‚Äôs nothing new to buy or earn. Even cosmicubes should be available people without stars more often. I also think that the idea of pusheen clothing for lots of beans is another way for people without stars to have fun with new costumes. 

But overall if anyone is looking to play this game I really recommend it for all ages. If you‚Äôre  a parent who is unsure if this game is appropriate, I‚Äôll just say that if you‚Äôre fine with seeing a little animated dead body on the floor I think it‚Äôll be fine.

  One thing I don‚Äôt like is you can‚Äôt chat. It might just be because I‚Äôm on mobile, but still, people should still be able to chat. Now, we have a few tabs with options to chat. It becomes harder to lie and defend yourself to the point it‚Äôs not fun.
  Secondly, I cannot play the game anymore. I‚Äôll try to go and find a server, but it‚Äôll come up with something to not allow me. I believe it‚Äôs because of the update. Before the updates, it‚Äôd load quickly, so I believe it‚Äôs because of the updates.
   Lastly, when I could get into games, it would take forever to load. It‚Äôd take 30-45 seconds. Sometimes by the time I loaded in, we‚Äôd be in a meeting. I‚Äôm sure multiple people would agree with my reasons as multiple friends of mine deleted it after the updates for these same reasons. I would bet others did too.
   If any developer sees this, I first would like to congratulate on your success with this game. However, you‚Äôve probably lost many players because of all the updates.

Ok, and second of all, maybe 4 maps mixed into 1 map would be nice, and smoothly designed, because, come on, I think most of us want that, really to be honest, so, if you can do that, Innersloth needs to do that.
And last of all, maybe we could have a bigger Meeting Room (Airship), because it‚Äôs kind of hard to walk through, so, if you could do that, it would be much easier to navigate through.

You could play this game for hours and never get bored because each game plays out differently with a new set of obstacles to overcome. 
I love playing this game, but there are some areas where Among Us needs to be fixed. Other than the occasional glitched map or gameplay, the biggest issue for me is joining an online game. Most times when you go to click on a game to join that seemingly has anywhere from 1 to 7 spots open, you are met with an error message saying that the lobby is full or the game has already started. On the other hand, you can sometimes joint game with 6 or more openings, but it takes a really long time for it to fill up to 10 players so you can actually start a game. Because of this, it often takes me seven or eight tries to finally join a game that‚Äôll start somewhat quickly, and the time wasted doing that can be really frustrating. I think there should be a better way of joining online games because it really degrades the experience when it takes several minutes for you to actually get in a game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-30T10:54:35-07:00

I am your regular among us player but I experienced a weird lobby today and want to write a review about it just to say something. So First I got back into a lobby after a random game with strangers and since the admin left I started the game. Buuuuuuuuut when the game started I saw the impostor screen for some reason and then when I spawned I saw on top of the crate on the right of Mira HQ and I couldn‚Äôt move for some reason. Then someone reported red‚Äôs body and then after the meeting I spawned at the table and when I looked down at the report and open button they weren‚Äôt their except I had the kill and sabotage button when I was in fact a crewmate and I was so confused and then when I tried to kill cyan in cafe it kicked me out of the game and said ‚Äú You were Banned for hacking ‚Äú ‚Äú pls stop‚Äù and that is why I‚Äôm here to write this review I don‚Äôt know if one of the impostors was hacking or my game was glitched out but I‚Äôm just saying that this game is fun and this is not a negative review I just wanted to say something so this would not happen again thx

Whenever someone kills me, I like the sounds they make, so I‚Äôm fine with being killed! The unlimited options a creativity really proves how much the creator(s) put into the game. If your scrolling through the reviews and haven‚Äôt downloaded the game yet, to download it! I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Ever since I showed my mom it, she‚Äôs been playing nonstop. It‚Äôs among us is the rage for 2020, it‚Äôs very unlikely to find someone who doesn‚Äôt know about the game. Over millions of fans have come up with animatics, theories, stories, and so much more. With over 50 appearance combinations, and playing with your friends, it really deserves a round of applause! I enjoy the simple tasks, just before heading over to security to see if the imposter snacked on a crew mate. You‚Äôll find all of your favorite YouTubers playing the game!

I don‚Äôt know if you guys are taking suggestions or not, I mean not that you guys need any suggestions, but I have an idea that I think is good. My idea is that when we enter the game and start the game, people shouldn‚Äôt leave during the game, i mean before and after is fine, but during the game people constantly leave and it‚Äôs annoying and not fair for the other players, I say this because when people leave the game ends early, and when they are killed and turned into ghosts they shouldn‚Äôt leave because they need to help the other crew mates win the game. I don‚Äôt know if you guys think it‚Äôs a good idea, but personally I do, because people leave during the game just because their not imposters, like that‚Äôs really annoying and not how the game works and they leave during the game, and when the imposters do a bad job on killing the players and they get caught, they‚Äôll just leave and that will just end the game early which is ANNOYING.

So my first glitch happens every time I play it is when I join a public lobby and then when it gets too the shhhh part it says five or more people have left the game but when I do it in the game every body is there. Another glitch I have is when I host a server and it says I have a banned or kicked people from my server when really I have not and then I‚Äôll get kicked out of the game for hacking. I do still think this is a good game but it takes a lot to make a game and I don‚Äôt think you took your time you just wanted to rush and get this game up. Anyways from now on I am not playing among us until these issues are addressed by have not been enjoying the game lately because of all these glitches. I don‚Äôt know if it was set up like this but I genuinely do you think that the game had no glitches at first but after I started playing it for a while every dayI was getting a new glitch.

It‚Äôs really taken the world by storm and it deserves all the accolades it‚Äôs received.  The recent update, however, has created a few minor issues.  The most notable are 1) sometimes the majority of the crew gets kicked from the game for no reason, leaving only a couple players left.  2) sometimes everyone gets the cutscene where the imposter makes a kill, so we all know who did it.  Other than that, it‚Äôs just generally slower and glitchier than before.  But I do really like all the new features.

The other thing I‚Äôd like to point out is how out of hand some of the players are getting.  I know this happens with any online game but it would be nice to have a way to report players for extreme verbal aggression or abuse.  Maybe something where you have to take the time to fill out WHY you feel the player is being abusive, to discourage players from reporting each other purely out of poor sportsmanship.

Other than those things, it really is a fantastic game, and I would absolutely give it 5 stars if not for the recent update‚Äôs extreme lag and frequent glitches.

Old Review: Among Us is a great game to play for a ‚ÄòClue‚Äô feeling. You can play with others on the same WiFi, online with players around the world, or you can use Freeplay. Freeplay is really just a practice mode, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a normal Among Us session. If the developers could have the A.I.s move around to do tasks, that would be cool. Also, when A.I.s are moving around, if they see you doing imposter-y things, they will find the shortest path to the ‚ÄòEmergency Meeting‚Äô button and say in the chat ‚ÄúI saw ___ kill Dummy _!‚Äù.

Or if you‚Äôre a crew mate, you just open up to a dead body and when no one has gotten a chance to even move.

Second, and this is a (much appreciated) suggestion as opposed to a glitch: please, please introduce a friend system!

Maybe medic, detective, and even a shark, sniper, etc. You could add new gamemodes like hide and seek, massacre where everyone is an imposter, and last man wins and maybe even something like Tad rush like the firs person done with tasks wins! 3.

And I‚Äôm not talking about the game settings, I‚Äôm talking about kicking/banning. So when your in the lobby the host can directly kick/ban you but while your playing the game the host has to get many people to vote to kick them. I wish it was like that in the lobby too. I‚Äôve gotten banned for catching the host for being imposter. The host cussed me out and told me to die. And all I had said was gg (good game). I‚Äôve also gotten banned for being the imposter and the crewmates were so close to winning but I (the imposter) won instead. People ban for no reason. So I feel that at least three people have to vote to ban someone. (Or even two if there are less people in the lobby.) And kicking should be all up to the host (which it already is). There should also be a report option. No not to report dead bodies but on a serious matter. I should be able to report someone that‚Äôs getting out of hand. Like if there was a report button I would immediately report the person who cussed me out and told me to go die. Anyways thanks for reading my review. And innersloth I absolutely love your game but please consider what I said.

Let people put inappropriate names like horny or porn club or fckmedaddy or fckmypussy that is what I get all the time I try to ignore it but the more they pop up and also make it so people don‚Äôt kick or bann you right when you enter the server because sometime I join and they just bann me with no reason I didn‚Äôt even do anything and just like give the server more time because I made a internet friend and we were waiting and waiting but no one came Well people came but left so we waited and the server closed due to unactivity and like give it like 10 more minutes than it usually would close and that is my opinion other people have different opinions but I just say do a couple of changes and that‚Äôs it thank you for the game though",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-08T14:56:45-07:00
6761480045,anonymos lover,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id752425382,2020.11.17,4,Bugs,"I love among us. It‚Äôs an amazing game that deserves its popularity. There are some issues I have with it though. I play among us on mobile, and half the time I enter a game, I get kicked out. They say that I sent more then 6 pings? I‚Äôm not sure what that means. Does it mean I talk too much? 
Anyways, the other issue that I‚Äôve come across recently is that my game glitches. Sometimes my avatar freezes, or moves really slowly, and then everything snaps and I either get kicked out of the game, or every thing speeds up and I miss out on a lot of stuff. Also for some reason, I can‚Äôt use ‚Äò? Why can‚Äôt I use ‚Äò?
The one thing I would love to have added would be friend requests, I have met so many amazing players that I will never meet again because I had to leave. I understand that you can‚Äôt just friend someone over just a name, and that there probably has to have an account form added, but I think many players would think the hassle would be worth it. Maybe the account can be optional? 
I really love this game, despite all of the bugs, it‚Äôs always made me laugh and genuinely have a good time. There are just some few issues that need to be fixed for it to be perfect.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-16T18:54:17-07:00

I really enjoy this game but I don't like the quick chat feature. Also with my apple phone, the game won't allow me to create an account. It says that I need to have one in order to play. I see this to be a problem because many people might not be able to make an account and  i think thats a bit unfair. It sometimes allows me to play, but not all the time. One more thing I wish to discuss is the ""once you click randomize name button you can't change it back"". I used to have a name that I like to have a lot and I was curious one day and clicked randomize name. My name is now stuck as ""StillClass"" and I can't change it back. The Ariship map is by far my favorite. I personally think you guys did very good on the making of the map. But can you add something so that the floating platform goes to the side where a player is at? I understand if the last request is a bit difficult or something that is unimportant and that's OK. But I would really appreciate it if you could possibly get the first two done. Good game!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-05T16:14:48-07:00
6964274142,wild craft girl,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1214786718,2020.11.17,4,Great game but I deleted it,So I played it for a day or two then I started getting bored and most of the time I‚Äôm not playing I‚Äôm just trying to find a server. The reason is is that when ever I find a server that says it‚Äôs 4 out of 10 as soon as a click it it says that the game is full I refresh the server and I try again still the same response i so this for about ten minuets and not actually playing the game. It‚Äôs either a glitch or that to many people love amount us that like hundreds of people are trying to join at the same time. Sometimes it says to wait for the host to return and like I‚Äôm waiting for 15 MINUITS this is probably something that the developers can‚Äôt fix but if there‚Äôs a way please try. Wait I have an idea why don‚Äôt when the host of the server leaves the second person who ever joined can become the host. Also when I make a server like litterly 0 people join me! I‚Äôm sooo srry that there‚Äôs so much suggestions but I have a nother one when me and my brother play it says that u can only start playing when there‚Äôs 4 people and who‚Äôs ever going to join a two out of ten person server?

7446970965,GamerLogan125,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1126477422,2021.5.25,3,Really like the concept but there are issues,"So, first thing to say, the game is fun, and a fun game to play when it‚Äôs a rainy day or something, but there are a few things that are quite annoying it say the least. First issue, is an issue that I literally thought of from my first match I played. That issue is that I feel you need to add bots to the game. The reason I want this is because it is quite are to get in a match a lot of the time, not because there aren‚Äôt people playing, but because it is constantly updating, and sometimes the only choices are to just join the servers with like 3 people in them, and sometimes I just can‚Äôt play because of this. Second thing is not as big as an issue, but I think that you should add a friend type system, where you can friend other players. Also, voice chat would be nice. The people who die get forcefully muted and can‚Äôt unmute. Maybe, I don‚Äôt know, but if your going to add an account t system, mine as well add some more stuff to it. Like maybe.. leveling up? Or something like that. But the main concern of all of this, and the only reason it‚Äôs 3 star, is because of the getting into a game issue. But, the game is amazing.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-09T19:32:28-07:00
8252933189,ayyeeeeelittt,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id598134395,2021.12.15,4,Great game,I love this game. I play this game everyday at work. It makes the time go by faster but i do have a couple things i would change. There is a lot of glitches. I wish the game came with updates that did away with the glitches. 2. I think the names should only be autogenerated. Children play this game and you have adults that choose vulgar inappropriate sexual and nasty names. Children should be presented with the chance to see those then leaving their parents upset or in a difficult spot when they child ask what the word means. There is bullying in this game. I think chats should be auto monitored. If you are going to type in chat be careful because people get salty real quick. Especially when they‚Äôre voted out. This game is also hacked a lot. I think there should be a system protecting th game from hackers. It would make the game a lot easier and more enjoyable. I would LOVE for there to be a hide n seek mode so you don‚Äôt have to keep refreshing the pages until you find one as well. I do love this game i just think it needs some tweaks. That‚Äôs my two sense. Thank you for releasing such a enjoyable game.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-17T18:37:16-07:00
6700809282,trisha paytassss,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1233901356,2020.11.17,5,Suggestions for the game,"I love among us and I just got good at it, I but Im going to give a few suggestions if that‚Äôs alright. First I would like to say that the imposters should have their own private chat, just so they can work with other imposters because especially in public servers one imposter doesn't always have the other one‚Äôs back. Second, I think there should be cameras in electrical because that is where most people have a fear of being killed or get killed. Third of all, instead of joining a specific game in the public server area, there should be just a button that says ‚Äújoin a game‚Äù and it automatically chooses a game for you so you don‚Äôt disconnect or get one of those annoying messages that says the server is full. Lastly, there should be an edition for people who are colorblind so they don‚Äôt get anything mixed up, because I‚Äôve played with colorblind people before and I‚Äôve seen how upsetting it is for them, and I think they should be able to have fun too. I hope you will consider some of these suggestions, it would mean a lot to me personally.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-29T17:45:40-07:00

Crew mates still have to try and vote out imposter but if the detective has to find the imposter them selves and kill the imposter (they can also kill crew mates since it's a guess of who they think the imposter is) you get the idea I hope. Another thing is that you can add more task if you want, last thing that you could add is instead of choosing map and how many imposters when your making a server you can choose it in the server just in case you change your mind or something, Or people in the server want to be on a different map or something. But on joining maps you can only change the map when there's up to 5 people and the server has been open for awhile so people can still choose the map they want and imposter amount like normal. One more thing that you really don't have to add but it would be cool, Make it where servers don't close from inactivity since people always just leave the servers anyway and add small mini games in the lobby while your waiting for people to join. That's all.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-09T16:39:02-07:00

You  also get to have roles you ether  get to be a crewmate that does tasks and if you do the tasks correctly you get to do is solve the mystery‚Äôs walk around  and observe everyone and you can even might find that other role is now the other role  is the imposter. The imposter‚Äòs job is to do fake tasks without being caught and even sabotage rams so no one can do other tasks and you can even vent to other rooms. Also eliminate other players. If you play this game good luck and have fun! One last thing if you either get illuminated or voted off the ship you can become a ghost and observe everyone if you got rid of the ship you can finally figure out who the imposter is but one catch  you cannot play the actual game and you cannot talk to other players.. last but not least if you keep game hopping you might get banned for an hour not forever an hour but I suggest not doing that anyways have fun!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-25T08:39:02-07:00

Second of all, maybe if someone swears too much, they get kicked off. Because I have encountered once that someone sweared with very bad words like, 30 times. Third, maybe you could add more sabatoges like, admin malfunction, and maybe you could add a setting called rp world, where you don‚Äôt have to do the among us stuff, you can rp in the world and not have to rage quit. I rage quitted once. Fourth and maybe last thing, maybe you could add more hats.  And you can add a setting called create a world, where you can create a world and people play on it when they are searching for servers and maps! And also, how do you do the weather node thing in polus. I have no absolute clue how to do that. Thank you innersloth for your time.

Finish tasks, find the murderer! Distinguish who‚Äôs lying or try to trick everyone else!  Play with friends! Or You could engage with other people, which, despite language, usually went well and made me feel overall really happy on lonely days. To know that there‚Äôs other people like me and they want to engage with me. Not everyone in the world hates me you know? However the new update ruined it all. Now you can only say certain things.  Such as who what when where and main objective questions and answers. Not only can I not regularly engage such as a simple ‚ÄòHiii!‚Äô or ‚Äòcool name‚Äô but I also can‚Äôt tell the complete details of a sighted murder in the game or ask to change game settings. The game isn‚Äôt fun if you can‚Äôt have the freedom to talk. Yes, I understand especially for younger players they need to play with caution. Bullying, or strangers online is always a scary and dangerous business but did they have to restrict the game to 17 and 9 year olds alike? Those playing the game do it at their own risk.
