I started playing this game in 2011, stopped because I had forgot about it and then started it back up and everyday when I get off of work and get home I sit down and play to wind down and have a good time. I hardly ever win, (I mean my percentage is lower than 35%! Lol), but I still look forward to it everyday. I’m surprised that people have constantly stated that there is glitches and issues. I have played this game for years, across many different platforms and versions, NEVER HAVE I HAD ANY ISSUES, when the connection is having issues, it is my understanding that it is the internet connection of myself or my opponent, and in this kind of situation if you wait it out then you will become the winner at the end of time out. I assume that both parties are assumed winners and I think that is a great way to deal with any issues among players. I’m assuming that the people who complain are just sore losers, and can’t be ok with accepting a loss. I think it’s fun either way win or lose, but I do think that I should be better by now with all the time I have played haha.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-24T18:54:06-07:00

There is a new bug I’ve noticed the past couple weeks that resulted in a warning that my account could be reset because the system thinks I’m hacking. The past three weeks I’ve noticed that any time I win a game, the coins I win don’t count toward the leaderboards. So for the past three weeks my account shows that I haven’t gained any winnings despite winning a few dozen games each week. I think because of this bug the app’s anti cheat software flagged my profile for going up roughly 10M coins but not showing any wins. 

Overall, this is a really fun game and a great way to pass the time (I mean, it has retained me as a player for 6 years). I would be really upset and probably never return to the game if I were to lose 6 years of progress including being level 150, have a collection power of 60, a gold tier VIP member, and 755M lifetime winnings due to a bug that is outside of my control.

The higher rank and more coins you have the default city changes. If you have 100,001 coins, it will default to Toronto and if you are not careful you can accidentally select Toronto as you try to swipe to another city. If you accidentally select and lose, now you have 1 coin remaining.  Obviously this is not a design flaw but a design in order to make it flawed so you undoubtedly need to purchase coins to continue to play. Really pisses me off as I had earned alot of coins at lower levels by winning alot and with one mistake it cost me $2.5M coins.  I lost to a “person” without ever having a turn...break and run.  There is also no option to back out...once you select a city, thats it! You are playing that city.  At a minimum, there ought to be an option that prompts you to confirm if you really want to play that city.

It’s been to my advantage and disadvantage.  For instance, out of 50 games played against the competition, if you miss and you’re under 3 balls left on the table, no matter how lousy the competition was performing, they cleared the table a staggering 98% of the time. Anyone who has physically played this game knows that isn’t possible, however, I understand the developers must make it fun for the casual player in order to be successful.  Another unrealistic feature is how every competitor can cut amazing. Especially if you continue to spend money and purchase multiple pool sticks. It would be nice to add to the “Practice Offline” feature the fundamentals and science to educate your audience. I know that’s a missed opportunity on the developers.  Like other gaming platforms, billiards is a game of poise, confidence, stance, & knowledge. The developers have not taken the time to find a way remedy this challenge.

Despite my love for this game I have recently dropped it from 5 to 4 stars and here is why. 1) it has become impossible for me to win consistently. I understand a players skill can fluctuate especially as you move up in rank. I just don't understand how I can go from having almost 2 million in coins and winning 100,000 coin games to being unable to consistently win 500 coin games. I don't trust computer programming because as you can see with the spinning wheel, it can easily be rigged. I don't trust organizations that make money from games like 8ball pool because what's to stop them from rigging the outcome of a players consistency. 2) like others I see connectivity issues. HOWEVER, I know they come from my wifi network. When I switch to cellular internet I do no have issues. Therefore I know where the problem is. The issue I have with the programming is that if I have a network loss the game will let me continue to the point where I even make a shot. Then all of a sudden my game goes back in time erases my shot and shows my opponent that I have timed out.

Using reverse English will land your cue ball in a pocket, for a scratch shot. 
You can almost bet the farm on it. More than not. I thought that maybe it wasn’t a glitch and it wouldn’t happen if you upgraded my stick to the highest level. No such luck. My stick is upgraded to the max and it scrTches every time if using hard English. It’s maddening and costs you game after game. Because most games usually hinge on one particular shot, 
that if it happens that it’s a hard English shot (hard meaning striking the cue ball with some power, pace) it’ll cost you the game. I’ve seen the cue ball seemingly go around other balls, like a guided missile to end up in the pocket forfeiting my shot and a lot of times the game. For such a good game to have such a glaring bug is a shame. By the way, there was a period in my life, I made my living shooting pool. So I know how English is suppose to work. And in this case, not work. That’s my only tic about the game. And after all it’s just a game, designed for entertainment, so if never fixed it won’t really matter.

keeps on trying to make you buy things or upgrade. Always into spending money to me. That’s just a little bit petty. It's because there’s a lot of kids here on the site. They could easily fall into the trap. It's an OK fun game, but I think it has to improve. Also, it is nice to be able to communicate a little with players. The game that you have to pick the pocket before you play, it doesn’t give you the Q stick on your hand, for you to be able to aim it. Hard to guess without the Q stick. What’s with this timer when you have to play in a calm way? The aim of the game is extremely sensitive.

However the more I play this game the more I realize the game cheats you out of games for an example. Every time I start the app up I immediately lose three games in a row and win two times in a row and then lose and resets my streak. But I don’t really care about that. The main problem is the bots and how they magically get a ball in from an angle that is near impossible🙄. ,But that still isn’t the main problem. The main problem is the amount of time I’ve lost it’s always been due to the fact I’ve had “slow connection” but I have never had any problems with my wifi or internet not even on apps that require lots of data. Also stop automatically giving people our money whenever we leave or quit. It’s annoying cuz what if the situation is urgent or you just don’t want to play anymore?

First - I wish their was a way to watch your friends play live. Like Clash of clans or other games you can watch clan mates and friends attack live, which would be really cool on this game. Even if you could send just replays to the club chat so others can watch would be awesome. 
Second - tournaments could be worked as well. The ones we have work tremendously well but making more/new ones would be even cooler. Club tournaments could be a possibility in this. Sending a tournament to the club and allowing club mates to join and play for a small prize at the end would be so fun. Which leads me to my next point that tournaments should go up in size to see who has some real skill. Especially if you have a lot of people in a clan then it would help to have like a 16 person tournament or something of greater numbers than 8.

When a player makes a full power shot the goes 5 rails before hitting the first of 4 balls to be pocketed on a single shot, you know at that point you have no chance against that player. It appears that the app company is OK with this even though you can report the offending player, nothing happens… I’ve played pool on actual pool tables for 30+ years, I know a good player when I see one and I also know cheats in the app. I’ve also experienced several times in the app where the position of the balls on the table were altered after a break, and never to my advantage. The other frustrating thing is 1 out of 5 times (20%) when I start playing 1 on 1 matches (8 or 9 ball), I get the chance to break, but usually not.

When playing people straight up, it’s a nice diversion.

Number one when you scratch the ball should be placed on the area where the ball was placed during the break. In reality you can place the ball anywhere from the bumper to the imaginary line where the ball was placed during the break and you can only line up a shot on the balls ahead of that line towards the far bumper. The app allows you to place the ball anywhere on the table that you like and because of that when people do that they are cheating they know it but the game doesn’t stop them Which is odd because throughout the game you can’t shoot your opponents ball but in reality you can shoot the opponents ball you just lose your shot if you make it. The bottom line is because the game allows you to place the cue ball anywhere you like on the table to make any shot after a scratch destroys the games credibility and since you can’t chat with your opponent you can’t tell them hey you can’t do that even though they know.  before I play this game again you will have to fix that glitch it is very frustrating to know people are cheating and the game is allowing it and you can’t do anything about it that’s why you get a one star,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-13T17:19:44-07:00

If you play an all in game, they will put you up against level 150s when you are level 13 so they make sure that you lose all of your chips so you have to buy more or wait an hour for 30 chips. The daily spin and wins are rigged as well. You always land on either 150 or 250 no matter what since it always starts on the same number. Even if you play against your friends in real time, the balls will defy all laws of physics. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME!!! THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO. Do not buy the special cues! It costs the price you bought to “recharge the cue” to be able to put cue spin on the cue ball. There is also the most obvious evidence that it is rigged: Your balls bounce out of the pockets while the opponent’s won’t. Just install an app like GamePigeon or Pool Break Lite to play pool with your friends or online. You might think it isn’t rigged at first because thats how they bring in new players. Once you start playing more often, they will start making you lose for reasons like “potting the 8 ball” when none of the balls hit it. I have RECORDED evidence of this. If you post about it on their support fourms they will ignore you or even go as far as deleting it.

The game steals time from you by saying slow connection and it loads and loads until you barely have any time to take a shot or you’ve already forfeited your shot by timing out. Also, idk when this started happening… but if you make a shot the cue ball is repositioned from where it landed as if resetting. It’s blatant and isn’t moved by just a little bit either. You could have a straight shot lined up then all of a sudden when it’s time for you to line up your shot; you have to shoot from a funky angle. I’m not a huge fan of the ranking system now where you have to win so many trophies to get to the next league. I was level 120 diamond league before I had to create a new account at the start of 2020. Now I’m a level 111 emerald league. And I’d unlocked all the trophies up to Toronto before the trophy thing started. With that update, it gave me all those trophies in one shot bc of how many games I’d won to that point which is ridiculous. This game is getting frustrating already.

The way they match you up with an opponent doesn’t make sense, you can be level 40 and get matched against someone who’s level 140 and has won over a billion coins, or you could be level 40 and play against someone who’s a level 5 it doesn’t make much sense. It also seems that after you stop using the App Store to buy coins and only use the free coins they give that they match you against harder opponents intentionally to make you blow through your coins quicker. Another thing I don’t like is you can buy an upgraded cue with in game coins and cash or pay via the App Store but you have to constantly “recharge” the cue for its abilities of better aim/power etc to work and it seems as though the “charge” only lasts maybe a few games before the cue that you paid for works the same as a regular cue they give for free.

The reason I have not complained is that I didn’t know who to complain to since we are not provided with a number or anywhere to complain. Someone has to look at this.

(1) when you finish an 8-ball game, the app sets you up for the next game by presenting the game that will consume the highest number if coins rather than the game you just played. I have inadvertently bet 100,000 or 500,000 coins on a game just because the app put that choice first. A better option would be fir you to be presented with the city you played in last as your default choice on the screen. This is probably intentional to get you to use up your coins, but it’s irritating. (2) when you watch videos to win coins, they don’t give you as many as they say they will. The 7,500 video gives you 5,000 coins and the 10,000 video gives you 7,500 most of the time. Sometimes you get what it says you will, but I haven’t figured out what causes it to give you less than advertised. By the way, I have played my entire 8-Ball Pool “career” with just the beginner cue.

It is fun to play and once you complete the tutorial you’ll find you got the hang of it pretty quickly. The game levels you up by “xp”(experience points) and the amount of tokens/coins you win. I’m not sure what the top level is but I have seen players whose lvls are 100+. My only complaint about the game is a recent update they made, you used to win 1 ring per 20ish games you won per “location” you played at (Ex: one of the 1v1 game “location” is “London pub”) but they just changed it to trophies which forces you to spend more tokens and play the higher cost games (Ex: you “bet” 100 tokens to win 200... etc.). I don’t like how it forces you to play higher up games as it makes me feel like it’s less about winning/having fun/skill up and more about spending more/or making in-game purchases. It would be nice to opt for a hybrid of both systems so that as long as you’re winning you can still skill up/lvl up rather than the focus being on spending.

First, every time you open the app you are shown an add for their own game. And if you accidentally press the ad than you get paid for like some coins or whatever. Second, my connection is pretty good so I’m assuming this is game, but my cue is always like either moving super fast or not moving at all. It’s weird and frustrating. Third, the spin wheel thing is rigged. For example, every time I spin it I get a hundred coins or something when there are options for like twenty thousand coins. I have been on this game for a while now and I always get the lowest amount of coins offered on it. Fourth, they sometimes pair me up with like level seventy people. I’m at level twenty so that’s a big jump. I would perfer if we played against people on our level or a few levels below or above us. This was it’s more fair and we get to play against people with our own skill level.

However, I think this update is getting a bit gimmicky. I was already a bit sceptical of the VIP Points system, and the new Rings seem pointless, and are clearly just an attempt to get more people to make in-app purchases. 

The worst thing, though, is the guidelines being put back into the two highest tournaments. There are already plenty of other places to play a game with guidelines, there was no need to change that. There should have been at least another two higher priced guideline free tournaments put in above them to compensate. The tournaments are no longer a challenge.

EDIT: The latest update is even more annoying. Rental fees for matches now? Really? They’re virtual coins for crap’s sake! You’re essentially just lying about the prize money amount for that table. And these annoying prize boxes that give worthless cues that you have to upgrade.

I gave the game 3 stars because there is definitely something wrong here. The biggest issue is the connection. I have lost countless games because of “slow connection” issues. Well, it’s not on my end. There is obviously a problem with the server or something in the software and it’s incredibly frustrating. I have played games where I sank the 8 ball, and I should have won, then the screen refreshes and my opponent sinks the 8 ball for the win. Are you kidding me? I have been in the middle of the game, made and sank my shot, then all of a sudden my opponent is shooting? In tournaments it’s even worse. I have lost the majority of the tournaments I entered solely because of connection issues. Beyond frustrating!

Bottom line, fun for the first hour then the game just go south as you start to level. There are enough people playing this game that I’m sure the developers are more than aware of the issues. I can’t think of any reason it hasn’t been resolved yet. That’s bad form in my opinion and I’m not the only one experiencing these issues.

Aiming is accurate more than 97% of the time but can be off as checked by a straight edge as much as six inches on a real table.  Balls that ricochet in the pocket always bounce out and never bounce in so it doesn’t take forward momentum in to account.  

Cue ball is notorious for finding crazy spots to land killing your shots or has a bias to scratch.  I’ve been stuck at a 72.1% win rate for three years which I joking say is due to me not spending on the game anymore.  No matter how hard I play it always centers there.  At first I tried very hard to improve as a personal challenge to get my win rate up.  Was having fun until I played a player named GHOST.  This player has a 99% win rate over 4,200 games which based on just the shear randomness of play and the skills of other players is in my opinion statistically impossible.  I would guess the game has been hacked so don’t put too much faith in your play.  Just play to have fun.

It’s is big on money making and will try to get you to buy coins or “break your piggy bank” coincidently having enough coins for the level you’re trying to get a ring or trophy points for. For some reason it has to keep your wins around 50-60 percent each way so the only way to do that is either play players who run the table or play bots that know the outcome of the break and run every ball. Every break is rigged to the advantage of the player depending on their win rate, and if it’s a bot just quit while you’re ahead. Even if you’re on the 8 ball and the other player has 1 ball on the table, it’ll still find a way to defense the 8 ball shot. I’ve seen it too many times. Also when you’re playing for a lot of coins and then they hit every ball in and make a 3 rail bank on the 8. Pretty funny stuff. They also need to fix the low English feature, it scratches if you hit low and hard everytime. Probably a glitch or something.

Iv even had times where it seems like it curves, gets spin i didn’t put on it, or even goes in a different direction then shown just to go into the pot. Game pigeon does not do this (at least it doesn’t happen in there for me near as much). Why does it here? I have even had times where I have gotten to the 8 ball and it’s like the que ball just doesn’t loose momentum to go into a pot despite using the same power on almost every shot and it not doing this. Then there is another problem where they match you with a level 65 at level 20. I don’t believe the levels are the problem but most of the time they have a god tier que and all the time in the world to make the shot and your stuck with a cow que or something.

The quick fire in offline mode is definitely a good example..you can get to almost any tier and the white ball always seems to travel more than any other ball on the table, especially to the pockets 😅 the time always runs even when you are not shooting because the balls are rolling forever...it’s definitely never the same time given back to you when you are potting balls left and right. You can get a whole table cleared in a matter of seconds and still have 10 seconds before you run out of time and guess what?...the white ball happens to be sunk in a pocket 🥴🤦🏻‍♂️ it’s almost as if they want you to lose in any given game. You pretty much know if you will or not. Maybe it’s just the way the games are played, but definitely something I’d be weary of as I do on the daily.

More than one time I have left the cue ball against the rail at a pocket making for a really difficult shot for my opponent. Next thing I see is the game more the ball off the rail making the shot easier for my opponent. The next flaw is the level of the opponent it pairs you with. 9 out of 10 times I’m playing against someone with much more experience, rarely someone of the same or near level. Now to the cheating. Several times when I had cue ball in hand after my opponent pocketed it, I would have just set the ball down to line up a shot only to be told “time ran out.” The most it had been was 3 seconds but now my opponent had the ball again. The biggest cheat is the loss of coins when you win. That’s right. LOST COINS WHILE WINNING!! Just today at 2 different times I lost coins when I won games.

Another big issue is the angles a ball can be cut, there's no way to cut over 90 degrees but with the game u can make impossible cuts making playing defense much harder! Also think when the cue ball is on the rail or up against another ball you shouldn't be able to use low English like in a real game.

I've seen other reviews where the maker was actively responding and helping to fix problems. I think as long as people play and spend money it doesn't matter what's wrong with the app. I also bought a piggy bank once and it said I would get a legendary x3 and I only got the piggy bank and not the legendary. What a rip-off when you think you're getting one thing and you get something else. I like the game I'm just not happy with the problems.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-17T18:48:17-07:00

Been playing it a long time, but it glitches sooooo much, causing me wins and coins. I will make a legal shot, and instead of it being my turn again, it will give the other player ball in hand! Also, when you choose your bet on certain games where you choose your bet, say for example I hit 500, it will take 500 coins from me, but will only count it as 100. So if you win the game, your only getting 200 coins, and loosing coins even if you win since you selected 500 and it took 500! Also another thing is when it starts glitching when your making shots and it causes you to lose. I mean there are so many glitches! The spinning wheel is another thing that I feel like is a scam. I’ve never got over 250 coins, and I’m level 45 and was also a level 50 on my old account that I lost when I switched phones. Sometimes it seems you just can’t win, even though you should! Like I said, I love this game, but the glitches make it hard to want to play sometimes! These have been going on for months now! Please fix and I will give 5 stars!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-03T13:18:43-07:00

Basically, this thing is stealing or lowering down my coins more than it should. I had 40,000 coins and I played for Sydney which only needs 100 coins as an entry. I loose the game and all of a sudden my coins went down to 37,000. Explain to me how that works. I start playing again to regain those coins and it just keeps lowering my coins. I just finished a game right now, I had 20,000 coins and I played a game in London which only needs 50 coins for entry fee. I loose that game and now I have 11,000 coins. I’m so frustrated, trying to get all my coins back but it just keeps lowering. Each time I loose a game, I loose about 10,000 coins. When I win, nothing happens, I just win the amount I’m supposed to win and we continue but whenever I loose, I not only loose the entry fee but also another 10,000 coins. It might be just me but I’ve tried everything and it still does the same thing. Fix this please!! I love this game, I’m addicted to it but how am I supposed to feel when y’all are legitimately stealing coins from me?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-22T20:52:50-07:00

Those 90 degree shots are 1 in 10!  It has helped my game BUT.... crap freezing and ball in hand...more than a few I didn’t get to shot. Not cause he ran it. 2 ball in hands later in a tourney made me angry the 1st time. Happened over 50 times. Then ... ohhhh man... when I make an 8 ball, and minutes later it pulls the 8... then what... yea.. ball in hand for him... on the 8.! Just update! Now way you fixed it all BUT... at least there’s effort. I say put it all on... handling crowd serge. Not being able to get a game in is where my line is. If I can’t play because the vendor can’t do it... history. I’m 1 in billions but.... pool is a mathematical perfect game. It’s also Respect!!🧐My stats are BOGUS!!!! I know “They” will Not give them back.... so let’s let me just start from zero. According to you I’m 51.4%! That is a joke! Renew, start, fair... yea right..... Good luck to all!

I email them and tell miniclip about the situation. Ever since then when I play my coin result is different from everyone and what it was for me in past. For example your week results for would always end in 0 but now mine ends in another number. Example my friends might have weekly result of 5,550 while my result were 5,538. What is this???? Also I played a game and won it gave me like 200 less coins than the 5,000 I should of gotten. What is this please fix or explain.

HEY GUYS! CHEATING IS HAPPENING! CHEATING IS HAPPENING! When you play someone there is always some connection issues due to your WIFI or theirs. But a new thing is happening; somehow some opponents disconnect just before you make your final or difficult shot. When you reconnect you are left with no time and you lose your turn leaving them with the winning shot. This is especially BAD  when your at a big money table as happened to me, more than once. This is not due to WiFi issues but to unsportsmenship play. Please fix this I implore you. I don’t want to spend money on coins to have bad elements in the game take the fun and competition away.  Look into it. And speak up if this is happening to you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-12T08:56:03-07:00
9976492518,Homeless2Home,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id975164332,5.12.2,1,Wish I could give a half a star,"Honestly this game is just something to use if you have no other game to play in existence. It’s a pay to win, pay to earn, pay to gain app. Even though there are plenty of things the app gives “freely”. Ultimately, if you are new to the game, expect to be playing against players that are ranked severely higher than you and come equipped with everything that the game has to offer from purchase. You have some games where you’ll win due to playing an AI bot. However, then you’re thrown into a pool of highly ranked players (anywhere ranking from 5-150 levels ahead of you) whilst you are at the bottom of the list. I’ve had to email the company numerous times about how my “earnings” have disappeared multiple times. They ensure that only players who “cheat” or “misuse the game” are violated by taking coins or permanently banning them. I’ve had a couple millions in my “earnings” that I did work up (AND EVEN PURCHASED) all to have it taken away and left with less than 200,000 coins. If this is the game you want to get taken advantage of by a company that has an apparent greed issue, than I’d say have fun. I’d rather download some 8-bit pool game than to play this trash again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-28T23:57:12-07:00
2189277296,CalSni87,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id711738674,3.12.3,5,Great game but kinda upset about losing my coins!,"I’ve been playing for a few weeks now and I’ve really enjoyed this game! The only complaint I have is losing my coins after winning a game and not receiving my bet coins or my winning coins back after the game has been won. This has happened quite a few times to me and is getting really frustrating. I’d really like for the developer to hook me up with my coins or something if possible, but we all know that most developers don’t read these comments so I doubt I’ll see them. If it continues to happen I’m going to have to move to a different game because building up coins and then losing them so easily is not cool at all. I’m going to hang in there for a few and see what happens. Hopefully I get all of my winnings from now on and maybe one day my coins will magically re-appear. Overall I love the game and I’m definitely addicted to it. It’s great for a free game and even better if you have the spare money to buy coins, upgrades, cues, and everything else.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2018-02-09T20:01:08-07:00
5182625572,A very grateful pokemon player,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id534984726,4.6.0,4,Quit pairing me with people 4 times my level!,"I’ve had this game for a little while now and I’ve been growing better and better at it. I wish I could say I have been having fun with the game but I’m not. After I spent $6.99 on an in app purchase I have been paired up with players who are 4 times my level or higher. It’s not fair or easy.
Another thing I’ve noticed is the constant pop ups showing you what deals you can buy. They will randomly open up after you exit a game and it’s very easy to accidentally tap one. The game is essentially rigged to make you purchase more coins by putting you up against people who don’t miss a shot. If you don’t get the break then you might as well quit the game right there. The devs really need to add skill based matchmaking. That way a level 18 player can’t be paired with a level 157 player. In what world does that make sense? Anyways it’s a fun game to play if you need to kill time. I don’t recommend trying to gain coins too quickly though otherwise they will pair you with level 500 no life Indians.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-22T11:13:35-07:00
5619740168,Lil Johnny 1891,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id200477582,4.7.7,3,Be warned,"Okay so this is a fun game, great to just play. I bought a few of those .99 cents spins got some extra coins, then issues came about. I had almost 130k in coins mainly won by playing. Now I’m sitting at 5k coins. What the hell happened, I know I’m a good player with a winning rate of 51%. Now it just seems to be bots or someone with cheat codes because I lost 125k coins in a matter of hours. Went from winning at least 2 maybe 3 out of 4 games to barely able to win 1 game outta 10. You may call it whatever you want I know I can play shoot I made 100k without a single purchase. Now basic shots, simple taps won’t make the shot. The other player that I go against will make shots that I just tried with ease. The other players can barely tap the ball to sink it and what do you know, it goes in. I tried the same shot and I’ll be damned if the cue ball doesn’t travel all over the board to a hole, like you can just tell that ball is moving wayyyyyy to much for how lite of a tap you did but no it likes to slide around like its on ice. 
The game is fun, but after a small transaction it seems the attitude of the game did a full 180.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-05T06:15:09-07:00
