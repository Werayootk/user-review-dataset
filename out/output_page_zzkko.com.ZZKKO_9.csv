I place 1-2 orders a week.  The clothes are stylish, affordable and good quality.  I have always loved that they have more than just clothes.  I have found beautiful accessories, unique and helpful cookware, shoes and purses.  One of the bonuses that has keep me doing weekly orders is their point system.  When you review the products in your order you‚Äôd get 30 points per product. You can than use those points to discount your order. That was awesome as I saved my points to discount my shipping.  Last week the point system changed.  Now you will only get 15 points on reviews.  That is so disappointing that they cut review points by half.  Reviewing clothing items takes time and to only give you 15 points is ridiculous.

Because the clothes on SHEIN are much more affordable, I've bought tons of clothes (work and casual clothes) and nothing has ripped or torn since I bought them!

However, I have three major qualms about the app and cooperation itself. The brand/clothes however are great

1, the production system. Shein is a fast fashion brand, so it rises and falls with trends so it‚Äôs horrible for the environment because of all the clothes being tossed. Not to mention the manufacturing chains they buy from don‚Äôt pay the workers well. So don‚Äôt buy in bulk. (REVIEWS ARE EVERYTHING, THEY SHOULD BE YOUR MAKE OR BREAK!)

2, there‚Äôs no way to organize your wishlist. I have ocd tendencies so this might not be an issue for everyone, but I can‚Äôt sort my wishlist, or even make sections for everything (season, style, event, etc) they do have boards, but it is a half hearted attempt.

3, this might be me being dumb, but I can‚Äôt share the wishlist. I‚Äôm a teen, so for Christmas/events, I normally send wishlists if I‚Äôm asked what I want. I can‚Äôt do that on the app so it‚Äôs super annoying. I can share specific clothes though. Doesn‚Äôt make much sense.

Most things are good quality, although some plus sized tops don‚Äôt have the seams adjusted quite right, so that there is more fabric to the back and less toward the front.

For reference, I am a size 18, with 40F chest. 2X or 3X typically fits without being clingy.

Their home items seem nice as well. One inspirational poster I ordered without a frame, arrived properly rolled, but was bound with a tight rubber and that left a sharp crease. Hoping to steam it out without melting the ink or making it run.
