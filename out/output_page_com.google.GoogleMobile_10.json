Google ruined the app by changing the open tabs layout, forcing users to close each single tab individually compared to their old close all button. This wouldn't be too big of a problem but the layout is slower with a noticeable delay in closing out a tab and moving to a new one compared to the instant swipe to close method from past versions. This might have been a slight oversight, but it really is a step backwards for google as far as functionality at the cost of the user.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-10-14T11:53:08-07:00"},{"id":"8057035362","userName":"chouye ff","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id590127471","version":"187.0","score":4,"title":"Title","text":"Old: It used to work, although not perfectly, it does work, but now for some reason every time I open the app, it crashes after 1 minute or 2, it doesn’t matter what I do in app, either searching up stuff or remain idle, the app crashes, restarting the phone did not work and deleting and reinstalling did not work, I hope to this will be fixed soon\n\nThe new update or time fixed it, idk what the reply is even replying to","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-11-23T21:55:21-07:00"},{"id":"10549665888","userName":"Panther0826","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id515022979","version":"288.0","score":3,"title":"Search a Song ( is gone )","text":"On IOS / Apple Phone.
