Additionally, the Uber app has made safety and security a top priority.  My wife has used Uber several times for transportation to and from our Hyundai repair shop and I never have to worry about her safety.    

The communication between myself and the Uber driver is one of the best features of your app.  Several other apps began utilizing similar real-time active-location apps, after Uber developed theirs first.  It’s remarkable how Uber simplified this comprehensive and complex process, whereby thousands upon thousands of Uber drivers and riders are continually provided the real-time communication that instantly links drivers and riders with the closest available drivers so you quickly get to where you need to go.  Without this brilliant tool Uber would not be the superior lift-service company that is today.

Thank you for providing such a wonderful app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-25T02:43:26-07:00

I went out into town to have a few drinks and wanted to play it safe and be responsible by calling an Uber to take me home. Little did I know..... they are non-existent in an area where the demand is very high. This is a populated town with many students and adults that travel into town to drink.... and Uber back home. Little did I know... I tried to call an Uber and after 25 minutes I realized it would probably be better to drunkenly walk 35 minutes to my home instead of waiting for something that is completely unreliable.

I used Uber to get to work and other destinations of course.

I just had this problem, I would cancel and cancel until I got a closer car, BUT THE SAME PERSON THAT WAS SUPER FAR KEPT ACCEPTING ME. I cancelled like 7 times (taking up my time) and I still couldn’t get away from that person. That is dangerous and Uber needs to change that. If you cancel on a person ATLEAST twice, then that car shouldn’t be an option for you anymore. I had to personally text that person to stop accepting me because they are too far. But once they stopped accepting me, well I got another Uber that was still over 20 mins away and I had to settle because all the cancelling was just wasting my time.

That’s happened to me several times. Of course it gets put back, but it takes sometimes as much as four or five days because of the way the banking system works for that to happen. I would also like to see an option included in the writers profile that would alert the driver automatically but they may need assistance. In my case, I am blind. Would like each driver to know that automatically rather than me having to necessarily text them every time.

But what isn’t okay is cancelling a ride after thirty minutes of being unable to find you which triggers a cancellation fee because of THEIR mistake. I was credited back the money I was charged but after reading reviews it seems this is a common occurrence. I ended up waiting an hour because I had to wait for a new driver, who didn’t have any problem finding me. The worst part about it is I messaged the first driver twice and tried to contact him so that he could find where I was but there was no response, just a cancellation. And yet the driver was rated highly, even though I would consider this highly unprofessional. I hope that in the future Uber looks into this and holds their drivers a little more accountable.

It is absolutely ridiculous that with as much as you charge there are still drivers who are so horrible....some that drive recklessly and others that have no regard for the rider stoping off to the store during a pick up etc. The customer service is no better with the cookie cutter responses to complaints and no real empathy in any situation for the consumer. It’s sad that this multimillion dollar operation can’t afford to do better in areas that are crucial to its consumer based platform. The convenience is the only reason this app is receiving 2 stars because otherwise I wouldn’t use it at all.

To add insult to injury, the “great” people at uber think it smart to reply to major customer service complaints with more computer generated cookie cutter responses.

The app also brags that is lets you book trips 30 days in advance, but my location was a “in-demand” location and it would not let me book in advance. When I finally made it to the airport and actually needed my ride, I opened the Uber app and it said since my location was experiencing hiring than normal usage a ride would now cost me $117!

First of all, scheduling rides ahead of time greatly inflates the price (I’ve seen my price increase to $30-40 for a ride that is normally 10), so leave early if you plan on making it to work on time. Drivers as a whole are unreliable and will cancel or ignore your ride requests regularly, while the app keeps your price the same. Also surges seem
Incredibly arbitrary. For example, a ride boosted from 10 to 20 due to a “surge”, and the driver that was 8 mins away ignored my request and I was stuck with a driver that was 15 mins away. I immediately cancelled and put another request in right away, and it was back down to $10. Also using this in conjunction with public transportation can result in you waiting outside in the cold for longer than you might expect so always dress warmly.

Their customer support team is useless and cannot pay attention to basic information or questions when I asked about this. 

Additionally, they allow drivers to rate people below five stars for ridiculous and bigoted reasons such as being black or being visibly LGBT. Drivers should only be allowed to rate under five stars if the rider was a hazard to safety or harassing them or engaged in criminal behavior. In that case the driver should immediately provide proof to Uber in the form of a police report and only then should a low rating be provided. Drivers frequently lie and project how they feel about Uber CEOs onto us, the consumer. We are simply using a service that is provided to us. It is the driver’s job to, well, do their job. Taxi cab drivers (who are now out of a job) from NYC would laugh in the face of these sensitive snowflake drivers. If you don’t want your car door slammed or for people to ask you to adjust music/AC, etc, then don’t become a driver.

This happened to us couple of times recently, we requested uber and driver didn’t move at all and waited until we cancelled, it was enough and we decided to document last one and bring this issue to uber’s attention.. So we called Uber and driver was less than a mile away.. After 5 mins, we sent him text to ask if he is coming, and he said of course he is... Then we waited 20 mins but ne never showed up! and we took screenshot almost every minute to show that the driver is not moving even though he is 2mins away...
After 20 mins ride was cancelled, we were charged $5 for cancellation, it felt very bad but finally we had evidence to bring this scam uber’s attention...
And after writing to support and sending all evidence; they said they cannot do anything and even though we tried to elevate, their customer service was the worst we ever seen... 
We still have all the evidence about this UBER SCAM, until it becomes CLASS ACTION SUIT!! It is not first time this happened and I’m pretty sure it happens to a lot of people and uber gets away stealing $5 a person each time!

At this point I just need to look into another car service.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-04-16T16:18:30-07:00

Not only are you liars but also scammers by using every possible technique to lure more customers with fake promises and fake reviews. Like I said, nothing but lies and more lies. Uber is trash.

Uber baits clients into hiring their services with fake time estimations, sometimes even by a difference of a whole hour of travel time. Embarrassing to place trust on such a fiendish company, suckering in innocent users. Shame on you uber and your developers for lying. Some of us have emergencies to attend to and we count on you! Terrible service to your clientele.

Your reply to this review simply excuses you as if all these LIES were normal. Your reply shows how much of a tool to money you are versus actually being truthful to your clientele. Your ETA's are always off by an hour, nothing but lies! I have used your system enough to get sick of it. I'm always anywhere between 30 minutes to a whole hour late to everything! Eat your lies full of shame and reply with a proper response that isn't some stupid excuse allowing you to continue to perpetrate and push these lies to your clientele. Shame on you. Emergencies are real!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-26T08:32:57-07:00

The customer support person tells me I make to many complaints and that I'm not able to get a refund, bc of it. And I don't think that is fare. First of all when I use to order Uber eats most of my food was wrong, or cold. And I gotten a refund the last time I order with Uber eats it was from a restaurant in palatine and they burnt my five potatoeskins all I wanted was a refund for those or a complimentary something. But No they told me I already have way too many complaints. Now another time I used an Uber pool. My 13 year old daughter was getting picked up from her high school to home which was about a mile away. She got a pool. And the Uber driver went and picked him up. Now mind you my daughter was almost home. Tell me why the Uber driver kept going to the other passengers destination. Passed up Her destination. And they charged me  the amount he was suppose to pay. I never saw it till 30 days later in my bank account. Not on Uber's app. Uber is a big joke when satisfying customers needs.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2017-10-24T04:35:02-07:00
7946113210,Chachi Arcola,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38524723,3.480.10004,5,Missing Family Option,"I’ve never given an app one star before until now. The iOS app and the website no longer feature Family Profile settings, so it is impossible to add another family rider to my account. This is essential for the safety of college kids, etc. 

It used to exist but is simply missing from the newer app updates, yet the legacy settings (I have one child set up on a Family Profile I can no longer see) appear to be locked in. 

An update is mandatory to reinstate the Family Profiles (preferred) or remove it completely so prior settings aren’t still linked. The current status allows for linked riders to continue ordering rides on the Family account without the ability to remove that person. That is a broken system, and it’s embarrassing that a large company can have such a large programming hole creating liabilities all around. Be better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-23T10:54:24-07:00
8891269946,🖖,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id441841807,3.519.10005,1,"Had to ride to work in a car with dried urine, support didn’t even refund the ride","Uber is very hit or miss in my experience. I did have some good experiences, but I’ve also had some bad ones. One of the worst occurred when the car I was in had dried urine all over the seats and smelled really strongly. This was on my way to work, and the smell was so strong that it lingered on me. This was an absolute nightmare.

The worst part, however, was that when I contacted customer support they didn’t even refund the 20$ ride. Instead they sent me a 5$ credit and a generic message. It also took them *multiple hours* to get back to me. Urine is a biohazard and it was so insulting that they treated it this way. Especially considering I had been using the app since 2018 and had spent significantly more than 20$ over the years on rides (I’ve used it a LOT). 

 I won’t be using Uber anymore after this experience, and I highly recommend not using this app. There’s terrible support and they don’t take safety issues seriously at all. Also support is really really hard to get a hold of. Like it took them multiple hours to respond to my first message.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-19T15:39:16-07:00
4703782305,"Angry Bird Fan - LBC, CA",https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id315989390,3.365.10003,5,Uber App - Easy to Use,"UBER’s App is great! The app lets me select my exact pick up location. It tells me how far away my driver is in comparison to me. I’m able to see the picture of my driver and the license plate of my driver. 

One thing that can be improved is the standby time. For example, if I’m calling for a pick up, there needs to be some compromise of time. The 2 minute wait by the driver at the pick up location may not always work. How about a 5 minute wait? Sometimes the driver is not in the area and takes some time to get to the location. If the driver doesn’t see the passenger/customer and has tried to reach them by phone, there should be a small charge of $2.00. This will be a small fee from the customer for not being ready for the pick up. Then, the Uber driver can cancel the pick up and move on to the next pick up. But this would only apply if the passenger is also ready for pick up and confirms that they are ready. 

Conversely, if the passenger is ready for a ride and the uber driver takes 15 min to get to the pick up location, Uber doesn’t discount the ride because there was no driver available within 5 min. The passenger just waits. So, how about give the customer a 5% discount coupon on the next Uber ride for being on time for pick up, especially on rides where the passenger waits more than 15 min for a driver to arrive. 

Think about it! 

Sincerely,
Happy Customer",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-31T10:07:53-07:00
6132611566,Naturallista,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id684445309,3.410.10001,3,Uber customer support,"I recently requested a ride a ride from Uber it was early in the morning a little after 4am. At the time of my request and after waiting more than 20 minutes to get connected with a driver. I was asked by the system to choose another ride because all drivers were busy I was bummed honestly and I’m still waiting for my refund. I didn’t want to waste anymore money and really needed to get home so I requested a ride with Lyft instead. I like Uber it’s a cool app, however it seems like the majority of the time the drivers have gps issues when picking me up and of course it’s fine when it comes to dropping me off. If some small changes could be added to the app to improve itself that would be great. I would like to see an actual customer support/service option for riders that actually allows you to speak to someone via phone/chat about any issues one maybe facing would be really helpful. Oh and one more positive about Uber is at least you may not have to wait too long. This morning I had to wait too long.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-28T09:39:32-07:00

Uber has a glitch on there part and began incorrectly stating my cards were expired and began charging things to the wrong cards. When I reached out to Uber they told me it was a glitch on there end and would contact me when it was fixed. After a week I emailed back and they stated they are working on it. After three weeks of back and forth Uber emailed me to say they can’t fix the issue there app caused and couldn’t recharge a different credit card after 30 days. The issue was at there end. Not mine and after emailing upwards of 20 times they refused to help and gave me no valid reason of why this issue couldn’t be fixed. I have taken all my business to lyft and the 15 accounts my business used for Uber have been canceled. GET BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND  HELP PEOPLE WHEN THEY CONTACT YOU. I will never use Uber again for business or personal use they are incompetent and they never can assist when needed. The glitch was on there part and any time I asked I got the same message back word for word. 
They lost a lot of business and honestly lyft is usually cheaper. USE LYFT 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-07T12:54:24-07:00
