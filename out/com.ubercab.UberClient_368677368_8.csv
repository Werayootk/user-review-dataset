Uber estimated the cost would be around $15. I was waiting for the app to find me a driver but I waited about 20 minutes and the app still hadn’t found a driver. Because of this I cancelled the request and it notified me that I might not want to do that because if I try again the wait may take just as long. I still decided to hit cancel because I figured I could get someone I know to pick me up. After cancelling the same rides that would have costed $15 showed to be $30 now that I had cancelled waiting. I just think this is very shady of the company to punish their customer for their long wait time. They also didn’t even give a warning that this would happen from cancelling the Uber search.

11053264868,Tekk Smith,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1611489707,3.605.10000,1,Unsafe Practices and Unfair Pricing - Think Twice Before Using Uber,"I’ve been a loyal Uber user for years, but after my latest experience, I’m reconsidering my choices. Recently, I was left stranded outside a closed business late at night because an Uber driver canceled after making me wait nearly 30 minutes. This situation not only compromised my safety but also exposed me to potential harm as I was carrying money to deposit. The fact that there was no way to re-enter the building due to automatic locks added to the distress.

What’s more disturbing is the apparent manipulation of fares. On attempting to book another ride, I discovered the fee was quadrupled, and not due to peak times. This incident wasn’t isolated; I’ve noticed a pattern where my frequent trips seem to incur higher fees, as if my user data is being monitored to exploit my reliance on Uber for increased charges. A comparison with another user booking at the same time revealed a significant difference in pricing, confirming my suspicions.

This experience has led me to question the ethics of Uber’s practices, from allowing drivers to irresponsibly cancel bookings to employing questionable algorithms that unfairly hike prices for regular users. It’s disappointing to see a service I once trusted resort to such tactics.

I urge potential users to consider these issues seriously. The lack of safety, transparency, and fairness is alarming. Until Uber addresses these practices and ensures accountability, I will be exploring alternative transportation options and encouraging others to do the same. Users deserve better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-16T21:15:31-07:00
