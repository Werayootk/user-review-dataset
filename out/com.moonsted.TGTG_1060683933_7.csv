That means it‚Äôs a toss up on whether there would be anyone here participating. But instead of letting me look on the website the site days ‚Äúdownload and see‚Äù so it takes me three minutes and a walk through and signing up for an account for them to tell me there‚Äôs no one in my area. Waste of my time to get my email address so now I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôll spam me about a product I can‚Äôt even use.

The only business that‚Äôs available or participating with the app a small chain coffee shop. It‚Äôs not worth it. I would have to drive out 2 hrs away to find options. Is this a new app? Or how long have you guys existed? Northern California like Sonoma county isn‚Äôt that far from San Francisco but yet I have to drive south for an hr to get something for $3.99. And peets coffee is only offering things like pastry‚Äôs. And it‚Äôs like getting 4 donuts for $4. This is so ridiculous. You don‚Äôt actually get leftovers from peets.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-08T11:26:28-07:00

They are ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù bags of food for a discount. I highly doubt these are cutting down on any food waste. How do they know that restaurants aren‚Äôt just buying the cheapest ingredients possible to throw in there and make more money, pretending like it‚Äôs this discounted deal?
