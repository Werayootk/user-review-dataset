I got 18 bagels that were made in the morning and I picked up at 2:30 in the afternoon. The value is incredible. A single bagel with peanut butter and jelly costs $6.30. With this app I got 18 bagels at 55 cents each. Yes, you can tell many of the pieces are not as fresh as when you buy in the morning. But they are still very soft. I split each in half, wrapped them in parchment, and now I have 3 months of bagels in my freezer :-) It‚Äôs so sad how much restaurant food goes to waste at the end of each day.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-03T12:38:26-07:00
