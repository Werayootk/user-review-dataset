With this app I got 18 bagels at 55 cents each. Yes, you can tell many of the pieces are not as fresh as when you buy in the morning. But they are still very soft.

The single thing that perplexes or confounds me is the stores that offer surprise bags at a designated time ‚Äúcheck back later at 9:16‚Äù , for example. I have attempted to acquire some surprise bag offers for weeks at the designated time, but no matter my ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù
to pounce on the offer, it sells out instantly. I am saying instantly- turns say 9:00 pm  & the surprise bag is gone by 9:00:01 seconds. I am sure that people, maybe the same people every day? Have figured out how to set up the transaction for instant purchase. Maybe the business is only making  one offer, however it is still instantly gone every day. Not quickly, instantly. 
Perhaps I am just not quick enough for the very popular offers, other than that I enjoy the whole idea of TwoGoodToGo very much, it‚Äôs  quite a clever concept.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-25T06:05:19-07:00
