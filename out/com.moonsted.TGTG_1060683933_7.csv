Grocery prices are outrageous right now and having the option to save money while also keeping food out of the landfill is so wonderful. The app is super easy to use and the options are pretty diverse. This is such an excellent and timely idea and implementation!

I was really surprised to see that when presented with options to filter choices there is an option for vegetarian and vegan but not gluten-free, even though several of the businesses have gluten-free options listed in their online menus and society is embracing gluten-free eating in growing numbers each year. 

My final critique is that even though there is a tab to click labeled ‚Äúallergies and ingredients,‚Äù there are never any listed, just a generic message to check with the listed store. It just seems like if your surprise bag regularly contains a major anaphylactic allergen like eggs, corn, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, dairy, fish, or shellfish, that could be added to the generic message to save lives, plus save time and energy for all involved. When selling food items, it‚Äôs the expedient and responsible thing to do.

I love the map feature and searching based on your location. I love that when you click on a stop you can have the choice of google or Apple Maps to get directions. It makes it so easy. Purchasing and picking up seems to be so easy. 

There are a few things that I think would make it better. 
1. The sorting options should show you things in order of the pick up time. I got out of a work training yesterday and wanted to see if I could grab dinner anywhere. There as an option but it took me a while to search through. I‚Äôd love to see an option to see the items listed by pick up time. I would spend more money on here if it was quicker access. 
2. I feel as though I have to look through multiple locations to actually see all the different places that are offering food that isn‚Äôt sold out. I don‚Äôt even know if the Browse shows them all or not. I wish there was one spot to know I was visually seeing them all. 
3. I wish there was a way to hide stores you don‚Äôt like. I will never order from this one donut shop in our town and they have 3 locations. I don‚Äôt like their donuts and yet every day I have to scroll through their listing for multiple of their locations. I wish there was a way to just hide the company as I will never purchase from there 

Again these are all things that would make me buy more and use this more. Great app and concept and I love it. Take my money!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-01T07:51:51-07:00

I wish a push alert for your favorites could go out so one knows when it‚Äôs available. It‚Äôs a great concept though.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-01T01:29:59-07:00

10644238923,Wtfisthepointofanickname,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id646741317,23.11.11,1,This app is FRAUDULENT,My experience with using this app is I paid $5 for a ‚Äúsurprise bag‚Äù from a local ice cream shop. When I showed up the worker said he never had nothing to give me and that this was often the case with people who purchase on TooGoodToGo. There is no communication between the shop and TooGoodToGo. They accept your payments and the transaction ends there.  There is no accountability by TGTG customer service. Just submit a request for refund and they‚Äôll assume next time it‚Äôll work out.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-30T21:12:35-07:00
