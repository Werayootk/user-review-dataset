I am a frequent user of the platform for taxi rides. Since the update, I find that the app will have riders & drivers being forced to leave locations, which they have to pass anyways to a destination, in order to meet the other party. A perfect scenario of this is when I had a destination set for a certain block. Instead of being dropped at my requested location, I was taken 3 blocks away. It was my observation that the gps then told the driver to drive past my requested drop off point on the way to the next location. I know the driver had to pass this point because I requested to stay in the car, since I saw he was passing my location ANYWAY. Uber has created a new, very unsatisfactory system. I make this review based on experiences from 10+ uber pool trips at different locations & times. This new system is outrageous.

There are roads that have changed, not so recently, from two-way to one-way. Signs installed that redirect traffic permanently, etc. As an app that focuses entirely on driving, routes, and maximising driver efficiency, staying on top of such things would be paramount. Maybe take a waze approach and have drivers submit closures & outdated routes. Not sure, you can do the r&d. 

That‚Äôs me being nit picky tho, uber could be a terrible interface and I would still use it. Safe, kind drivers, quick, and easy to sort.

When Julia arrived, we first placed the baby in the car so we could then load our other stuff.  I told Julia I tried calling her twice to update my location, but her phone was off.

I am a avid user of ride sharing apps with over 200+ rides with Uber since starting. 

The problem is they get really greedy with the pricing. Ask any driver and have an open discussion about the cost of the trip vs what the driver makes and you will find a big disparity in what you pay vs what the drivers make.

The other red flag with Uber is how they handle spot pricing. If you call an Uber right before a surge pricing event occurs in your area you are immediately deprioritized from nearby drivers and the app will force you to rebook at a higher fee. I just had this happen to me today where I agreed to pay $38 dollars to get home. After 15 minutes of waiting I cancelled the ride and looked again only to find my $38 fare was now increased to $46! Frustrated, I installed Lyft to see what the cost to go home would be and it was $33! Checked back to Uber after installing Lyft only to find Uber had completely jacked the cost of my ride home upward $60!!!! >:(

While the laws do not prevent this kind of behavior, it is sadly a common experience for people like me who depend heavily on ridesharing to get back and forth. I spend roughly $1000 a month in ridesharing alone and have come to the conclusion that the only way to avoid being ripped off is by talking about these experiences and hope this spurs others to take action as well.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-22T13:44:48-07:00

I actually have worked in customer support before and when a customer asks to be transferred to a supervisor to escalate the call the correct procedure is to transfer to a supervisor. Both agents closed the chat in my after literally offering NO SUPPORT about my item. I keep explaining the situation but they keep sending the same exact scripted messages. I have been talking to customer support for over 2 weeks in order to receive help and NOTHING. Meanwhile the driver that stole my phone doesn‚Äôt even get a slap on the wrist. All I get from Uber is ‚Äòwe tried but he‚Äôs not picking up, but we‚Äôll let you know once he picks up‚Äô FOR 2 STRAIGHT WEEKS. What kind of amateur customer support is this? At LYFT they ACTUALLY provide you with help when situations like this happen. I‚Äôve been a long time Uber costumer but it‚Äôs constantly the same issues with customer support being unhelpful. I recommend Lyft or just taking a cab for anyone that values their time and money.

Now, uber overcharges on fares and lies about having discounts. I had an uber pass that I paid for monthly for discounts since I was a frequent user but I found out after a while that uber doesn‚Äôt actually give a discount and if it does, it‚Äôs by a couple of cents. They inflate prices and claim it‚Äôs due to ‚Äúbeing busy‚Äù. Also, once you look up a price, you pretty much have to be ready to purchase right at that time or else the price will be increased since it‚Äôs logged that you wanna go to that desired location you just checked. Also, I am a diamond member due to the amount of points I have and I purchased a 20% discount to avoid paying an $70 fair for what‚Äôs really supposed to be $50 at most and and when I put in my desired location in again for the discount, the price stayed the same and claimed my fair was $80!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-17T11:56:48-07:00

I use that account specifically for online purchases and only out what I need in that account for purchases so once I was double charged and the account was overdrawn my bank sent me a notification. 

I contacted Uber support through the app to inform them of their error. I was told they had to charge me again because they weren‚Äôt able to take the full amount the first time and at the end of the message it said no response needed as if they couldn‚Äôt have made an error and the conversation was over. I opened the chat back up to respond and explain how they had taken the full charge and even sent a screenshot of the statement to prove I was charged the full amount plus an additional amount. That was days ago and I have not heard from Uber since. Now I have to dispute these charges with my bank and never ride with Uber again. If you don‚Äôt like money stolen out of your account and support disregarding your concerns I suggest you do not use Uber.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-21T04:04:15-07:00
4165370097,Mjay98,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id124438249,3.351.10003,2,Change price back to range,"I have had Uber for years and have never had the desire to review until now. First, something needs to be done when I driver cancels the trip. If I am charged a fee when I cancel a trip, then I should be given money when they cancel it because it is an EXTREME inconvenience. I was waiting for a driver for 15 minutes and when he was almost here, suddenly it was cancelled. Then I had to find another driver and wait another 15 minutes and at that point, I had missed my appointment. 
My other major critique is the new ‚Äúexact price‚Äù. This may seem like a good idea, but in practice, it is costing me more money. I no longer get charged on actual kilometers or time travelled, but instead, am given a price in the middle of the usual range and it ends up costing a lot more. A lot of times drivers take different routes or take more/less time to get to the destination than predicted. Please bring back the price range, and base trips on actual distance and time. 
If these two issues or at least one are addressed, then I will resubmit a positive review.

Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-17T09:08:00-07:00

This weekend I requested a ride to a destination about a mile and a half away. Somehow the driver ended up going the wrong direction and we hit a toll we shouldn‚Äôt have. I said that it seemed like we weren‚Äôt going in the right direction so when she got to the other side of the bridge she should turn around. She said she thought we were close so she already accepted another rider and would only be able to take us back on the other side of the toll. She tried to drop us off on the side of the road and the other passenger had to ask her to please pull up to the sidewalk for our safety. We had to walk close to a mile to get to the originally requested destination. I sent a note to Uber support through the app and they did not understand why I was dissatisfied or upset at all. They were only willing to refund me the toll charges even though the driver didn‚Äôt get me anywhere near my destination. I am so upset and bothered by their reaction to this unsafe situation that I do not even feel comfortable using Uber going forward.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-06T15:32:21-07:00

Recently I would request uber and the app would change drivers a few times before a driver actually starts to head to pick up location, and even then the drivers would not actually come. I‚Äôve already had this happen twice in the last two/ three months where I would request uber wait for 20-30 minutes and while on the map it says only 10 minutes away but the driver is not moving. I try to call the driver and text him to get eta but no response. I cancel the ride and they charge me a cancellation fee. Back then it was really easy to dispute the charge or email uber. Now they make you go through a bunch of auto responses/questions that don‚Äôt actually help you with disputing the charge. So basically you‚Äôll waste time waiting AND they‚Äôll charge you a cancellation fee. When you want to email or talk to someone it is impossible. I looked on their website, signed on to the account and still can‚Äôt find any customer service contact.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-11T20:34:28-07:00
