I have been using this messenger since its creation and have never encountered anything like this. If yours is buggy, it’s again your fault, because you were stingy to buy a normal phone. If you are a person with normal interests, a good phone and love privacy, then these are the apps for you, don’t listen to others, draw your own conclusions.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-25T12:33:07-07:00
