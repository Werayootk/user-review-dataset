There are a few downfalls to the platform, such as groups being a little clunky to create if you do not have the people you are adding to the group in your contacts, no video calling, needing to use your phone number to make an account, etc., but these are all minor issues with an otherwise superb service that is always being improved. It’s great to be able to send a file and not have to worry too much about file transfer limits, like on Discord. 

Since the standard Telegram app became telegram X, I found one bug- most of my sticker packs will not correctly load, and will be unusable. That’s the only bug I’ve encountered so far.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2018-11-19T05:28:28-07:00

The only bad I can say with this app, lies not with its developers, but with Apple and the AppStore. I’ll find channels with discourse of all varying opinions. Something I find refreshing. But I’ll then go to revisit, only be prompted that the channel is blocked due to violations of AppStore guidelines. There is no violation. It’s Apple using its corporate mass to silence opinions it seems as bad. 

Because of this, I will NEVER use or buy another Apple product. Once this phone dies, that’s it. Anything but an Apple. ANY other phone.

But the problem is “file” sharing on iPhone. When you want to share a heavy file (by tapping the share button on the file and choose telegram to send) you have to look at the upload progress till it finishes the  percentage line! If you skip this level or want to do something else on your phone you won’t be able, or you will lose your file sharing progress. Whatsapp isn't like that and the file can be seen in your whatsapp messenger even if it has not been sent with a “retry sending” button that can easily send your file in the app itself and without exiting the messenger.

1. Abbilty to orgnize channels and groups and even chats in the SUBJECT order (for example: work, school, college, entertainment and ...)
2. Feed for channels ( i dont know if i am spelling right🙄) I mean somthing like instagram, to put all the channels you want on the feed and all of them appear on one place (and i know that is a huge request)

Photos, videos, messages- poof, gone. By mistake or intentionally, deleting someone else’s valuable data shouldn’t be possible. Secondly, this messaging platform has no watchOS app, which is unforgivable. Apple Watch has been out since early 2015. Thirdly, no Live Photos support nearly eight years after their introduction. Even sending a Live Photo as a “file” will remove the live aspect of it, meaning Telegram is file-destructive even when it says it isn’t. Forth, there is no support for Focus Modes on iOS and macOS, meaning you cannot mute certain chats based on which Focus Mode you’re in. Lastly, Telegram does not let users store their own encryption keys like iMessage does.

Unfortunately, some Telegram features, such as stickers, don’t work correctly under iOS 11.4 that was just released – even though we fixed this issue weeks ago. 

Apple has been preventing Telegram from updating its iOS apps globally ever since the Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store. Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users’ communications to Russia’s security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country. 

Unfortunately, Apple didn’t side with us. While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram’s userbase, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world since mid-April. As a result, we’ve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation and will keep you updated.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2018-05-31T04:06:30-07:00

*Deleted folder; where your delete chat goes into then after a specific period. It deletes conversations for whichever way it was set to delete, either for both user or only for me

iMessage feature where it ask you to keep or delete voice note. Despite the conversation not to delete I’d like a feature where we can choose to send disappearing voice note!! Just like disappearing pictures!!!

SharePlay or rave feature!!
Add a few where friends can listen to music or movie in sync!!! No need for external app!! So while chatting friends can just sync and listen to music or watch movies together in the app!!
