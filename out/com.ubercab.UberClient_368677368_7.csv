I left my iPhone 10 on the front seat when my wife and I arrived at the Sydney cruise terminal.  Once on the ship I noticed that my phone was missing.  We called my phone from my wife’s phone many times.  I could see from the ‘find Mt phone app’ that my phone was near the terminal.  When we FaceTimed my phone, the driver ‘Robindra ‘ answered. We then spoke through one of his passengers.  I told him we had a reward waiting at the terminal for him.  He kept saying something about two hours of his time.  38 minutes later Royal Caribbean cruise security said he wanted $50 US dollars.  Our tip was $20 US.  We were not allowed off the ship or I would have met him with the Sydney police.  Security grabbed my phone from him and returned it to me.   I so grateful to the staff.

This is a major point of frustration and I’ve been late several times. Finally, I go from my home to my gym a few times a week on Uber. EVERY time you recommend the driver does a u-turn on a busy road as the way to drop me off. So you know what? They drop me off across the street - which is a bus stop & technically illegal - and I either have to run through traffic or walk to the end of the block and wait for the traffic light. Your gps should pick a route that isn’t completely ridiculous and that the driver will actually do. These issues get me so frustrated I have now switched to using lyft more frequently.

Uber should be responsible for making up the difference if their initially quoted bids don’t clear. This is blatant disregard for the customer experience and borderline exploitation, where the price paid is often updated in-ride or before the ride without the rider accepting the new price.

Example: nine out of 10 GPS routes are the long route costing the rider more than they should pay because there is a shorter route and Uber will say that it was due to traffic congestion on the shorter route that the longer route was chosen, when in reality that was not true at all. They just claim it to keep from getting sued in a class action lawsuit by millions of people who are paying for the long route making Uber millions of dollars all over the world for having a fraudulent algorithm that picks a slightly longer route for a large percentage of the rides done all over the world.

Uber fraudulently charged all the cards on my profile for weeks. Uber and Uber eats (I've never even use) charged one of my cards over $300 in the past two weeks. Multiple of my accounts have had to be closed because of them. They have been linked to over $600 of fraudulent charges on my accounts. Drivers claim fraudulent cleaning fees and will not refund the fee unless you threaten to dispute the charge with your bank. Luckily an Uber driver filed a false cleaning fee on one of my card causing my card company to flag it for fraud protection and bringing my attention to the theft. So thank you to that shady Uber driver. I will never use the company again.

There is no customer service to deal with any issues encountered with Uber all responses are automated. There is no way to contact customer service via telephone. The company has better business bureau rating of an F for a reason! The company should be shut down. Based on the horrible reviews I don't know how they have such a high rating. I'm fully convinced they have fake reviews to raise their rating.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-09T07:17:35-07:00

When I arrived at Newark Airport on Wednesday Oct 4th morning at noon I called for a pick up went and told the driver I was waiting for my luggage he said he may have to move which he did and I was unable to get ahold of him to see where he was. I tried calling the number he called my and no response. I was charged for a cancellation fee very upset about that would like that refunded. Then called again found this driver and when we got to our destination the Staten Island Hotel he said he was a 5 star rating and on his phone proceeds to give himself that rate so wrong of him to do that. Then I tried Uber again on Saturday in the afternoon I called once again after I hung up I forgot to ask what color and type of car he was driving I called back could not get him very upset once again. I went through the Uber app and got to do you want to cancel it said click ok to cancel I didn’t do that and continued to wait he never showed up and once again I was charged for a cancellation fee. Very very unhappy with this service will not recommend to anyone.

On a recent trip, unbeknownst to me, I dropped my IPhone somewhere in the vehicle.  I tried a number of ways to contact Uber with no success.  Finally, I set up an Uber ride, and when the driver arrived, told him my sad story.  He spent almost 20 minutes on the phone trying to make whomever was on the other end understand the problem.  When ending the conversation the driver still wasn’t sure the man understood the problem, but if so, I should get a call within the next 2-3 hours.  That time came and went, And I was sure my phone was gone.  I put it on Lost Phone with a number to call if the phone was found.  Finally a couple of more hours and the original driver called, was still in the area, and brought my phone back.

I don’t have to carry cash & the drivers have been great for the most part. But, what I hate is there no way to contact them with a problem. I want to say more than a star or five. Sometimes I want to say - the driver was nice but the car was dirty. Or the driver knew a great alternative to the upcoming traffic. But Uber doesn’t give you an option beyond the stars. It’s frustrating. Even more frustrating is the cancellation policy. It’s bad. he can cancel for any reason and yet the passenger is charged a minimum of $5.44 for something the driver did when they weren’t canceling because of the passengers I don’t think that’s fair and there’s no option for that when you’re disputing it. you have to say one of the options they list which is not always accurate it’s something more.

Pool is bad for drivers and passengers; scrap it. Uber is not a bus. It’s original scope was to keep it a private ride. Who wants someone you don’t know riding with you; it’s a huge security risk (Maybe they’re drunk and I’m not, or even worse, the opposite). You might say “you don’t have to choose pool,” but the concept is just a bad idea.

Saving Home and Work pick up locations is a great idea, and being able to save destinations is helpful. But expand pick up location selections so we can name our own locations would be helpful. Setting up predetermined trips would be even more helpful. You should be able to choose “Pick up MOM and bring her to UNCLE JOE, etc. without having to manually plan the route each time.

Lastly, PAY YOUR DRIVERS MORE OF A PERCENTAGE. The quality of drivers and cars will increase exponentially if you take less and give them more (15% commission for Uber is more than fair). Anything more is exploitation, in my view.

He told me it was too far, he can’t drive that far. Another driver accepted and after letting him know it’s a 4 hour trip, he cancelled. Thankfully someone else accepted the trip and I was able to get to my destination on time. At this point it seems scheduling a taxi service is better and more reliable. It’s better to use the older means of transportation. Another situation, a driver accepted my ride. I noticed he kept moving further away as opposed to closer. I tried calling and texting yet he ignored. He ended up cancelling the trip. I wonder what he put as his reason for cancellation.

Obviously an error on the app’s end. When we brought this issue up with several of the Uber representatives, they were rude, not the least bit helpful and insisted that we were the ones who approved the higher fare from the beginning, which was not the case for either of us. One rep even provided step by step instructions on how to delete the app for my friend- completely tasteless. 

Since then we both have deleted the Uber app and have given our business to Lyft, a business that treats their customers a lot better than Uber does, and knows how to handle customer service with class.

I got ready to go and went to request my ride, only to find that the rate without the walk was TWICE THE PRICE. Firstly, a 50% price increase is unacceptable. Secondly, it’s time for Uber to update their app and show the Pool rate *without* the walking option *before* a rider goes through all the steps to request the Pool. This is coming from a 4’7 woman who is not exactly comfortable walking around Chicago alone and putting her safety at risk just to save some money.

It’s time to be transparent about your fees from the beginning, Uber- because your customers always have the option to switch to Lyft.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-03T15:25:26-07:00
3801213177,BritSouzaSantoa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id248643177,3.339.10002,1,Worst customer service ever,"I travel alot and do not have a car, so I use Uber on a daily basis. Or shall I say, I used to use Uber. All I did was change change my bank card number couple months back, so because a few dates went unpaid they deactivated my account. I have every intention of paying these fares, just need access to account to add new credit card number and done. Easy right? A 20 minute phone call could clear it up? Nope. Uber doesn't allow calls, it's all email based customer service system. So, we are on day 76, and email 51 to try to get whatever fares I owed paid. Seriously, I counted. Every single email I send is responded back by a different person, so I would say roughly 40% of the emails are a generic automated response of 'just open your account and add new card', followed by that person closing the claim, then me having to start all over again. Seriously, hands down the worst experience with customer service ever. Even if they ever figure out how I can pay them to get my account reopened, they went from me using without second thought, to being my last possible option in countries without other ride shares. I really hope anyone in charge reads this. FIX THIS SYSTEM.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-22T07:34:11-07:00

Uber has allowed riders to fabric stories to there advantage along with exaggerated complaints from the rider party without hearing the driver side . They would say people low ratings or all complaints are dealt with fairly this is not true . I dedicated my entire work ethic and long nights and hrs to being one of the best drivers to have a complaint fabrications towards me that cost me my survival , safety, and well being . This is not fair Uber doesn’t investigate the situation entirely if a rider makes up a complaint because they tell you they are missing they train or they will miss their flight and get made at you and tell you they have faster route then if you switch lanes to cooperate with the rider then the riders get mad they missed train or bus they report you and if it’s traffic they report you and say you driving slow or switching lanes. After thousands of rides and a few bad reviews not to mentioned alll my rewards and good reviews they deactivated my account Uber gps also makes it where you might have to do sudden turns because it was slow but it’s all the driver fault I guess because I have been deactivated",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-01-15T23:15:40-07:00

It’s a good thing that they’ve helped revive the job market, but this means that you get people with no customer service experience. Sometimes you’re lucky to get someone who hates their job or used your ride as a vent session (I should seriously ask uber for my money back for these sessions if I’m going to counsel their drivers) then you get beat up cars and smelly cars. The comfort of having uber was so that you didn’t have to wait for unreliable taxi drivers. But now I’d rather deal with them... I am one of those people who give drivers 5 stars because I know that everyone needs a job, but if i hate the driver, I don’t tip. That says a lot!

UPDATE: it would help if there was an option to choose the language my driver speaks. I feel rude as heck when I can’t speak my drivers language and they are trying to communicate with me. Or I am trying to help navigate. 

And for NJ/NY users, we should be able to choose a driver who is able to drive to NYC. It is frustrating having to cancel or being asked to cancel a ride because the driver cannot make trips to NYC.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-11-28T15:10:48-07:00

If you can, I’d HIGHLY recommend using Lyft from now on. If you feel you need Uber, use PayPal for extra financial protection. 

For the last few days I’ve been begging Uber to freeze my account that I was locked out of by a hacker that is currently siphoning hundreds of dollars out of my bank account.  Uber mysteriously did away with their customer service hotline and their email support.  We now have to communicate through the app and/twitter to receive any sort of interaction with their support staff, whom really seem to just serve as bouncers for the company rather than helpers for the people using their service.  I’ve been sending them pictures of the receipts, updating on developments in the case, and asking for any sort of indication that they’re receiving my messages; only to be met with disdain and utter dismissal for my attempts of communicating with them.  They refused to secure my account (I was locked out or I’d do it myself) and/or freeze it during their investigation.  So I keep getting charged for someone else’s joy rides while I have to figure out how to pay for my school books and desperately needed new glasses.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-08-20T12:49:43-07:00
7558221759,Ehngur,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id430995159,3.465.10000,1,You will be overcharged,I’ve been using u we to get to and from work for a while now. I schedule ahead of time because I know my work schedule in advance. I will also know how much I will be charged in advance too because it tells you when you book. There have been a few things wrong with the way this works. First is I had quite a few Uber drivers cancel on me and then I had to go in and call for a new Uber only to find out they were charging me 3x as much and the first quote. It went from like $12 to $40. That’s just one way! Meaning if it ends up being $40 to work $40 back I’m barely making my money that day. Then to top it off there is no way to get ahold of customer service directly. They want you to email them and you just have to hope and pray that they get back to you in a reasonable time or even at all. Another thing I’ve been noticing is that I schedule a ride ahead of time and they have been showing up more than 30 min early. At that point I’m rushing to get ready so I’m not wasting so much of their time. The only reason they deserve a one star is because Uber eats pretty much immediately refunds me when my food is missing.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-09T13:40:14-07:00

You should create a feature in the texting feature that has a preset text message for the driver to create or a toggle button such as the deaf or hard of hearing to be set up. Otherwise the driver has to constantly for each ride text or copy and paste a message into the text app to alert the rider. This can be time-consuming and very distracting.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-27T23:38:25-07:00
1900854383,TBerri621,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22318003,3.268.10002,1,Not acceptable,"I ordered an UberX ride from the airport to home and was told my Uber driver was 12 minutes away because he was finishing up a trip. That was fine, that happens. The driver called me about ten minutes later to ask me where I was, and I told him that I was in the designated pick up area. He said he was dropping off another rider at departures and he'd circle around again to come pick me up, and I said okay; then he asked me where I was going and I told him. He didn't seem happy about it, and while I was trying to describe what I looked like so he could find me easily, he hung up on me. 

Several minutes later, he pulled up, picked up another rider that was standing a few feet away from me, and drove off, and my app said it was locating another driver for me. This new one was supposedly 13 minutes away. 

I tried to call Uber to see what had happened, but the automated system wouldn't recognize my phone number, even though it's not blocked and it's the same number listed on my Uber account. I tried to cancel this latest ride but Uber wanted to charge me $5 for the new driver's time. Instead, I had to contact that driver and he canceled the ride for me. I ended up taking a taxi.

You have to ask the question the right way-3- You cannot reach UBER by telephone- the answering machine tells you that you are not a premium member- I guess telling you that you are not a valued customer. It tells you to make a complaint through the app which is not user friendly. They need to make it clear how to make a complaint, tell drivers to stop picking up non users and to stop answering calls and then lying that the person is not there to get a cancellation fee!!!!! Recently In the past week I had five drivers that responded to my call for a ride and then went to another location to pick up someone else leaving me and my family stranded and abandoned!!!!! Yesterday, I literally saw the UBER driver pick up someone else on my ride and when I texted her that she had the wrong person in her car she ignored me. So am I being charged for someone else  using my ride? I don’t know. I can’t reach anyone!!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-25T07:15:14-07:00
