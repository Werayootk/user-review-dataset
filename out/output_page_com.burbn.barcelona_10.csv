I want to suggest that an ‚Äòapp lock‚Äô feature is added to your app, including Face ID, PIN & Password options, so that in the case someone else is using your phone, they do not snoop, especially w/private, sensitive info, & mess w/your settings.

After scrolling through my ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù feed, I found nothing but divisive, indecent, horrible behavior from people. Threads seems to favor social discourse and sexual content over the wellbeing of things. I know Instagram seems to have a lot of censorship towards certain topics, and I can find this to be the case here as well. This is basically an even worse version of twitter before Elon took over.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T23:50:21-07:00

10119017158,Nateh128,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33655078,289,3,Great start,"I‚Äôm hoping this can be a permanent replacement for Twitter. Main points of annoyance:
 - Whenever I open the app, rather than letting me start from where I was it jumps up to a random point in the feed 
 - Badly needs following-only chronological feed
 - Recommendations are random, like influencers I wouldn‚Äôt care about, vs driven by the people I follow 
 - No desktop version",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-08T16:59:04-07:00
10114042598,Kate Michele,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1171308584,289,3,Meh. Potential but nothing special yet.,It has potential but they didnt fix what the issue was with twitter. You still can not edit a post after it has been shared. You also see a bunch of posts of accounts you are not following. Which defeats the purpose of trying to control the feed with things you chose.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T08:11:24-07:00
