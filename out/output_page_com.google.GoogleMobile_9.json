Firstly, the filter functionality seems to be malfunctioning. For instance, when I set specific dates for my hotel stay, the system unexpectedly changes them as I browse through different hotel options. This inconsistency is quite frustrating.\n\nAdditionally, there‚Äôs a problem with the rating filter. When I specify a minimum rating of 4.0, I expect to see only hotels that meet this criterion. However, the results often include hotels with lower ratings. This not only wastes my time but also forces me to contact third-party services, which usually results in unproductive and time-consuming discussions with customer service representatives who often seem indifferent to my concerns.\n\nI hope these issues can be resolved promptly to ensure a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
