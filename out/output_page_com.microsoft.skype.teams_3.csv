Reviewer Name: Ray Harris

I couldn't be more thrilled with the Teams app! This incredible collaboration tool has revolutionized the way my team operates and boosts our productivity to new heights. With its impressive range of features, seamless user experience, and excellent customer support, Teams truly deserves a glowing review.

From the moment I started using Teams, I was blown away by its intuitive interface. The app's sleek design makes it a pleasure to navigate, saving us valuable time and effort. Whether it's creating channels for specific projects or participating in video conferences, everything is conveniently organized, ensuring a smooth workflow.

One standout feature is the ability to chat and collaborate in real-time. Instant messaging allows for quick communication within teams, keeping everyone on the same page. It's incredibly efficient, enabling us to tackle urgent issues promptly and avoid any miscommunication.

The video conferencing capabilities are top-notch. Smooth and reliable, Teams",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-06T07:51:36-07:00

But the Teams app itself is basically just a copy and paste of the mobile version (same with Outlook). I was hoping it’d be more robust on iPad but it seems they just widened the screen to fit more into the view and didn’t add any additional functions. You can’t even open up a Teams group’s calendar (you get a message that says “this app isn’t available on mobile) so you’re stuck with just your personal calendar but not your group calendars. I’m working on an iPad Pro on the go so I really hope they bring more functionality to iPads, otherwise I’m limited to waiting until I’m back on a desktop.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-21T05:59:07-07:00

Unfortunately now I am forced to take photos with my phone, convert them to files, email them to myself, save them to my PC, then upload to Teams. A process that took a couple of minutes previously is now taking large chunks of my day.

I believe this is an iOS system function and not under developer control, thought. It’s still frustrating when you get dozens of notifications per day. 

It’s also frustrating that iOS receives notifications before the desktop app does. My phone, over WiFi, gets notified faster than my desktop workstation, wired. 

It’s also frustrating that there are not synced notifications between iOS and desktop.

Also - for teams niche needs, there is also the option to add third party apps (design apps/communication/sales you name it). It’s design is intuitive.

This app is probably the best remote meetings and chat platform that exists. The problem? By uninstalling it I’ve literally doubled my battery life. With background processes shut off and a relatively light day of meetings (2, 1 hour meetings) my phone was still dead by 3pm everyday. When I removed this app from my phone, it’s last well into the next day, 1-2am. 

It’s honestly a bit disturbing and shocking how much drain is happening even when the app is inactive - before shutting off background processes it was averaging 5 hours of screen off time. Then when that was flipped off it only went down to 1. The windows app nearly crashes my work computer daily so maybe I should have expected this.

The iOS wheel UI never works properly when trying to select a meeting time and when sliding the hours or minutes it freezes and continues changing the value and only updates when letting go. Another issue is that when comparing the meeting scheduling to Outlook Mobile, Teams performs far worse. Scheduling a meeting on outlook is so easy, employs better use of meeting conflict visibility and even has a “lite” version of scheduling assistant to see what times are free. Teams mobile has none of these features. Why not just replicate Outlook UI with the Teams color scheme?

2. This app drains my phone battery like nothing else? Is there any room for improvement? I have the newest iPhone and it drains my battery completely with 3-4 meetings that last 30 mins each.

3. During a meeting, it also heats up the phone a lot and when using the speaker output to listen to a meeting, sometimes it starts sounding all robotic like and when I go to check to see what’s wrong with teams/my phone, my phone feels like it’s been in the microwave - something’s wrong with the speaker output

We need some type of “snooze notifications” for when a rapid fire conversation starts that doesn’t need immediate attention. Right now you can toggle to “silent notifications” in iOS but if I don’t remember to turn them back on in a timely fashion I’ll miss something super important. 

Ideally: 
•I’m notified for a new message
•I can determine if the conversation is something that needs my immediate attention
•if not I could hit a snooze button  (15m/30m/1h) to quiet notifications for that specific chat group while my colleagues talked.

I want to use Teams for all of my biz communication!

The devs are figuring out how to notify me when I’m using a platform that can be integrated, in real-time. 

The platform is missing a specific funneling-cadence for tracking and forecasting progression, but I’m certain that’s due to growing pains.

The mobile app could be more IOS friendly, but the tech-lagging is understandable, considering the source. 

Overall, the devs deserve a round of applause!

It’s a terrific platform for optimizing multiple communication methods like emails, CRM’s, and clouds management.

As it continues to mature, I’m expecting this platform to integrate an optimized AI mix and pivot into more of a Personal Assistant for customers.

If I’m in the ballpark with my review, and Teams is close to implementing a GTM product with the following milestones, it could soon become an everyday app for me:

1) Adapts to my current “Work-from-Home” lifestyle with a Personalized Assistant.

2) Optimizes my Work/ Life balance, streamlining all of my online activity, with personalized suggestions.

3) Secures, monitors, and protects my IP-PI database, consistently, with an All-In-1 Security Assistant.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-24T11:30:43-07:00
