I am moved to provide a review for Booking,com as it may well be one of a very few experiences I’ve had in which the services provided far exceeded the expectations. Every encounter I’ve had has been quickly and appropriately handled with professional courtesy and superior results. Whether the property didn’t show my reservation, or was not at all as was described such that it appeared unsafe to remain, or the hotel clerk was unacceptably rude, the folks at Booking were quick to ensure we were properly accommodated at the property or provided an alternative accommodation elsewhere that exceeded the original booking in value but refunded the difference in price.  I am impressed by the genuine concern shown when a customer needs help. This was all before I had reached genius status, in which I am now entitled to a prioritized customer service experience, which I cannot believe is possible as I have never been on a call for more than 5-10 minutes having all issues resolved. I am genuinely grateful and impressed by this company.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-27T20:59:03-07:00

It’s about a 10 minute walk from the local train and 17-20 minute walk to a JR station. Also, very easy access to Dotonburi shopping areas and restaurants(8-10 minute walk). Great location hands down. Away from all the noise but still really close to everything. The shower head was amazing and the bathroom is fully equipped with essentials that we need during the entirety of our stay. It was clean and a decent size for the area. We didn’t get to use the tub but I can imagine it would be great for a private onsen. The front desk was also available 24/7 and I like that you can help yourself with coffee and any essentials you may need for your stay. 

We had issues with clogged/water leakage on the toilet. They said it was because we maybe flushed too much? I didn’t know that that was a thing. We used it like any other restrooms. It happened twice and the 2 front desk people were helpful and even came in with towels to dry the floor.  Very nice and polite. They said they were going to call a plumber but that person never came. You also have to make a request before 11 a.m. to get your room cleaned and give them your room key.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anybody staying in Osaka/Dotonbouri area.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-23T02:55:22-07:00

We called requesting a plunger thinking we could fix it ourselves. We were told by the front desk person, Moe, that she was looking for a plunger Later she responded that she assumed the previous guest she loaned it to never returned it and she could not find a plunger at all within the entire hotel. She proceeded to be belligerent and hostile attempting to argue that we had to change rooms since she couldn’t locate a plunger. She immediately requested we turn off the water which we did. At the end of the discussion, which was recorded, she said we would have to change rooms, and we had no choice, even though we had cut off the water as requested. We explained we had children sleeping and were not going to disrupt everyone since it was after midnight to which she hung up on us. We proceeded to lie down and go to sleep. Then at 12:40 AM we had two police officers knock on our door waking us all, stating that the hotel, Moe, said we were refusing to move. At almost one in the morning, we re-packed all of our bags and moved ourselves and our two children to a different floor in a different room with a “working toilet”. Horrible customer service! For our children to wake up to police knocking at the door and have to move to a different floor at almost 1 am because of a clogged toilet is ridiculous and traumatizing!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-09T22:03:01-07:00

I arrived at the apartment complex and could not reach the host. I reached out to customer service (I use that term loosely) who also could not reach host and I was told I had to pay nearly double to stay at a hotel because of availability. They stated if I booked a new room through another company, I would be charged for canceling less than 24 hours before my reservation and would not be able to refund the stay even though they could not reach host to give me access to the accommodations I had paid for. Booking a new hotel through them at almost twice my original rate was the only way they would refund the $420 for my 2 night stay. They didn’t even transfer the payment to the new reservation. I have to wait 5-7 business days to see if my refund will be processed. So I have basically paid them $1100 to stay at a Hampton Inn double room for 2 nights in Phoenix. The supervisor stated they are just a middle man and not responsible for me not being able to get into the apartment I was standing in front of. I asked him what the benefit of using their services was if they didn’t back their services and he said he could give me a $75 voucher off my next stay but not the one I needed for that night.

I called before we booked to make sure the pool was working ( 15 minutes before checking in), because this trip was for my sons birthday. We check in, unload the car, and go straight to the pool.

I went back up to him and he said no he needed them to call him. I got them on the phone right in front of him. He started yelling and told us to get our things and get out. My partner told him she did not appreciate him treating me in that way. He then gets in his car and speeds away. After telling us to come back when our things are out.

They received an email confirming it was cancelled and that no charge will be made. To their surprise, one week after the cancellation they got charged the full amount of €240 a night. Then the nightmare began. Calling booking customer was a horrendous experience. Every person picking up the call would tell us a different story. They would say they did not charged it, or that it corresponded to another reservation (which it didn’t), or they would acknowledge it was a mistake and that they had to wait. We also called the hotel which confirmed that on their end they never charged us and therefore it had been Booking making the charge.  After one month of about 17 calls with Booking customer service and sending bank documents to proof that the reservation had been charged to their bank account, finally my parents bank was able to present a complaint to Visa, providing all the documents, and they received the refund that Booking would deny them over and over again.

Parking is a BIG issue on the weekends. Apartment comes with a parking pass for all spaces in Arona but unfortunately, almost impossible to find and if and when you do find one, you can never move your car. Entrance to the building was dark but we were met by Angelo who was very helpful with bags, building thankfully has an elevator. Upon entry the apartment is bright and airy with large French doors that open to the Piazza and many windows that provide a nice cross ventilation. it is advertised to have a pull out couch in the living room, but the pull out couch is for a child not an adult. The bed in the bedroom was very uncomfortable as the mattress probably needs to be replaced. The worst part was that we never were able to sleep until 2 o’clock in the morning because of the fact that the piazza fills up with people at restaurants, music, lots of cars, lots of motorcycles, It’s great if you’re part of it, young crowd. Garbage and glass pick is at 6:00 am right outside the apartment windows. We really feel as if that should have been mentioned in the description.

There is a great cafe in the square to the left and we also walked to and from to train station ( about 20 minutes with luggage on cobblestone, not fun but very doable. FYI, Cabs are hard to come by in Florence) the building itself is beautiful, it’s a historical residence, not a hotel or airbnb. It’s probably not what you are used to staying in but it certainly provided a new experience to our trip. It’s like being brought back through time. There are modern upgrades to rooms and bathrooms. The AC worked great. The bed was very comfy. The staff is wonderful and I was able to communicate with Chiara on WhatsApp my entire stay when I needed assistance. There are two flights of stone steps to get to the rooms on first floor. But Fabrizio helped us with our luggage when we checked in.

Unable to open two suitcases at the same time. Bathroom very small especially the corner shower.  Very difficult to even turn around in. Breakfast not included but if your willing to pay 16 pounds u can get cold food in a buffet in the basement….nothing even came close being warm or hot…..dinner was not an option since they discontinued it totally before our arrival….the bar, this is a great one…the bar is only open thuraday, friday, and saturday from 5 to 9…thats it but i can understand why….its the worst looking small unfriendly uninviting bar i have ever seen.  Went by it all three days and never saw anyone in it…..seriously why waste your time.

Our room did not look like any of the pictures on their web site.  We had 4 steep stairs to climb into the bathroom.

THEY SCAM CUSTOMERS. THEY FORCED A CANCLE? GOOD LUCK GETTING A REFUND. Look at the developer response. They provide NO EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER. If they did it would be from INDIA and they will say “SORRY” that’s it. They will laugh as they took 800 dollars from you booking a flight that they canceled. I received emails about booking canceled flights to my last destination, so this forced my hand to cancel my remaining flights since they couldn’t find me connecting flights anymore. Booking inc has gave me wrong confirmation numbers, gave wrong phone numbers, and Hang up the phone each time I have called. Singapore airlines tried hard to process my refund. They needed phone number from booking (which booking was unable to provide), they needed email address which they gave me incorrect one. Ultimately booking stopped giving me updates on the refund status. The money is gone, since it first has to reach Booking inc hands before, so if Booking inc doesn’t report it to me it’s their money. Highly unethical. I tried to escalate the case and they didn’t give me a supervisor.

First, a lot of accommodations (especially in the US) charge a security deposit. It’s almost never easy to find out how much it is and it can even cause a cancelation if it goes over your card limit. I really feel security deposits are a form of age discrimination. What I would like is a way for the app to filter OUT properties that charge a security deposit. This would show age discriminating businesses that we won’t tolerate it. Secondly, again in the US, it doesn’t show the taxes until you’re on the last page to book. It makes properties seem cheaper than they really are. Booking even in expensive countries like the UK can still be cheaper because it’s difficult to find something affordable and safe in the US. Some of these things may be difficult to change given how unfriendly the US is towards its own consumers, but I overall love using this app and hope they can do something to punish age discriminating businesses and help save us money when booking domestic.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-23T16:06:44-07:00

The host intervened before I got someone live at booking and I got my key.  The next morning, the host and I got messages from booking that I had not checked in to my rental.  I assured booking that I had, and relayed that to my host.  13 hours later, the only thing I’ve heard from booking is that I will hear back within 24 hours (11 hours from now).

That is, I have often felt I was falling between the cracks in apps in the last 2 years, so was this skeptical of one that would hold so much info ( safety, financial) and transport hotel details of a reservation. But, it does, and so seamlessly set up my personal and business accounts (and led me thru process of organizing my 'books') in just making a travel plan that I was unaware of all the gains until now. 

The ease of use, for those of us with little or waning patience for glitches, 'fear of losing things' syndrome is great...hang in there thru a 3-4 bookings. it will all start appearing, syncing, all history intact, etc. My hope is (once again...) restored!!!

June 30th till July 6th, 2022.
It was a very pleasant stay starting from
Checking in, I had request an earlier check in as I was coming in the morning. They let me check in at 10:30 am although the regular check in time was 2pm. 
The receptionists lakshmi and Manas very helpful and professional. 
The room was nice and spacious, the breakfast had nice variety and the house keeping guy, Saurabh always had a smile on his face. He always clean the room and make sure we had enough water, and our coffee and other things were always filled. Very kind.   
I had a car so basement had lots of parking available. No matter what time of the day I would come. One day I left my car light on and the front desk called me to let me know that my car light is left on, that was so nice of them. Otherwise my car battery could have died, in this hot humid July month. 
When it was time to check out, my flight was really really late at night, and they kept my luggage for good 10 hours with them :) it was so easy. 
There was a small hair Salon on ground level where I went for blow dryer twice, it was so convenient to have a salon at the hotel site. 
One day I used the serenity spa and had a massage done, it was really relaxing. 
Overall I would say, it was 5/5 experience for me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-06T04:28:35-07:00

The view from our first floor room was amazing. Very large windows and remote control blinds made it all the better. The bathroom was up to date and clean. The bed slept well and I would rate it above above average. The addition of the included mini bar was a nice touch. They restock the wine, water, coke, diet Coke (Coke Light), Sprite, beer, and peanuts every evening. I never heard noise from the nieghboring rooms. The location was central enough to get around easily. It is only an eight minute walk with luggage to the central train station. The staff was welcoming and accommodating. I had but two complaints. First, the water in our shower and one of the double sinks in the room had a drainage problem. They backed up very quickly. The tub and other sink did not have the same issue. Overall, I would say the hotel was the best I've stayed at in Amsterdam.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2018-03-06T14:18:13-07:00

I booked well over a month in advance requesting a bottom floor and got a 3rd floor room. The breakfast was nothing like it said had coffee and granola bars really disappointing! They say they are only 2.6 miles from the stadium and they are over 6.6 miles away!! The person checking us in seemed very rude and not very friendly at all!! At check out the lady was leaving the lobby briefly asked me what room and said fine and walked away not sure if I was supposed to do anything else instead, I really hope it was fine because there was no one else around to ask!!

If I could give it 10 stars I would. The customer service was over and above and outstanding in every way. I cannot believe how wonderful the staff was. My room was ready early, everything was explained as to their services, what I received with the room, etc.  They were very attentive with me as to what I might need, what could they do for me, what tips I might want about the city, etc.
The room was lovely and modern. Wonderful large window with a view. And I utilized the rooftop terrace a few times and enjoyed it very much. They reserved a taxi for me to get to the airport no problem.
The Sophie Terrace Hotel provided me with some of the best Customer Service I’ve ever received along with outstanding accommodations. Highly recommend.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-13T05:47:06-07:00

When I arrived at the hotel reserved by booking, it was overbooked. I was NOT given the alternative by the booking support staff. They urged me to book other hotels on my own after numerous calls, and they said they would reimburse the difference. They also affirm that there are no price restrictions on the hotels I can book. However, after I turned in the invoices, they indicated they would only reimburse $25 because I had made my own reservations for the alternative and would have to pay the remaining amount. I reminded them that, the booking support team asked me to find alternative because they couldn't do it, that’s why I must find other alternative by myself, but they ignore their liability. I requested to speak with the customer compliance agency, and they provided me with the EU commission, which does not assist US clients. They said that Booking is a Dutch base company so there are no agencies support US customers.
