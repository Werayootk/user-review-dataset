11061299253,ihatefukingnicknames,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27479324,45.0,2,The app isn’t great and the customer service is awful,"The app itself is poorly designed and hard to use. The search works ok but it doesn’t allow booking multiple rooms with different numbers of people in them. 

It appears that the app is just a giant aggregator that leaches money from services without adding much benefit at all, choosing to, instead, defer the resolution of problems to the service provider and offering no real assistance itself. This because evident during a trip to Italy from the US where a mix of upgrades that could not be done through the app and the resolution of unfortunate return flight problems that Booking.com refused to help with caused me real frustration that never got resolved at all. 

And that’s the real problem: booking.com customer service is terrible. Just, really, really, awful. 

Especially irritating is that it seems that booking from the US causes a problem with the conversion of birthdates — the three flights I’ve booked through the app adjusted our birthdays back one day, requiring us to go through the airline to fix it because, of course, Booking.com customer service was useless. 

I’ve booked my last thing through booking.com. Hopefully I won’t have any more problems because if I do, the app will be pointless to resolve them.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T03:55:09-07:00
