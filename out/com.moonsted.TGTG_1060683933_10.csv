While the premise of each purchase is that you will receive fair market value equal to what you purchase, there is the inherent uncertainty and with it gamble that today the store you bought a surprise bag from will have lots of leftovers. As for the stores themselves, this app allows for them to minimize food waste, make a few dollars off of their leftovers, and reach a potentially new demographic of customer who at first try that store via this app but over time can become a new loyal customer. 

I believe in the idiom ‚Äúwaste not, want not‚Äù and with this app and how it seeks to achieve its purpose, I am convinced that TGTG has found that right balance in doing its part to help reduce food waste.
