I like using LinkedIn for all of my professional contacts, seeing what jobs are available, what trainings are being recommended and what is new with the companies that I follow and my network.  

While I am in the app and finding businesses I want to follow, it would be great if there could be cross-platform of all Meta Platform apps that when I follow a company here, I would automatically be following all of the affiliated pages for that company within all apps on the Meta Platform.  This would allow friends who are on FaceBook but not necessarily already on LinkedIn be able to see on my wall what different company’s are offering since I have ads appearing.  This might entice them to either checkout a training class or product that they might not necessarily have known about along with eliminate me from missing a cross post to the other platform.  

I notice that company’s I am following are also available in my Amazon platform.  Since Amazon is also on the Meta Platform, it would be easier for me if not only when I follow the company on LinkedIn that the follow also attaches to all other applications including Amazon on the Meta Platform.  

Thank you!

I can of course use tee browser version but it would be nice to get this app to play nice with Stage Manager. Its probably because the app isn't built in Swift. Which I'm learning...is a lot of iOS apps. Most of them are built in React. But i dont know how to build in either so who am I.

They need more options for submitting incorrect job postings. I can’t tell you how many are marked as remote when they’re actually hybrid and the actual location is nowhere near the posted location. 

I also find the cost of their Premium service to be way too expensive for the limited benefit you receive from it. They have also made it to where you cannot cancel from the app or your cellphone’s browser. You have to cancel from a desktop computer browser. What if you are someone who has lost their job, doesn’t have a personal computer at home, can’t afford the $40+/month, and you can’t cancel the subscription from your phone? I think a complaint to the BBB is in order.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-16T09:10:20-07:00

Also, I am constantly contacted by recruiters who have clearly not viewed my profile, and contact me about roles that I am already in or overqualified for. If it clearly says in my profile that my current role is a “Senior Analyst,” why do you think I would be interested in an entry level “Analyst” role? This is happens CONSTANTLY, and is very discouraging during a job search. I would like this to stop happening. Please require recruiters to actually view your profiles before contacting potential applicants.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-12T07:49:40-07:00

However, the job search feature needs work.  The filters do not work very.  For example, I always select the “on-site” and “hybrid” options for locations, and yet I will get job after job that is “remote” even though I have purposely not chosen that as an option.  The website has the same issue if you try to use it on a PC.

The site is also buggy from the employers side.  My team has tried multiple times to post a job and I have received the same error claiming that there is an issue with my email.  The app/website support is poor and I have not been able to successfully contact them.  

LinkedIn could make every other platform irrelevant if they could just improve their job search engine.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-12T06:46:09-07:00
