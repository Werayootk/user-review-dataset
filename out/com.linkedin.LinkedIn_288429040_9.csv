I like using LinkedIn for all of my professional contacts, seeing what jobs are available, what trainings are being recommended and what is new with the companies that I follow and my network.  

While I am in the app and finding businesses I want to follow, it would be great if there could be cross-platform of all Meta Platform apps that when I follow a company here, I would automatically be following all of the affiliated pages for that company within all apps on the Meta Platform.  This would allow friends who are on FaceBook but not necessarily already on LinkedIn be able to see on my wall what different company’s are offering since I have ads appearing.  This might entice them to either checkout a training class or product that they might not necessarily have known about along with eliminate me from missing a cross post to the other platform.  

I notice that company’s I am following are also available in my Amazon platform.  Since Amazon is also on the Meta Platform, it would be easier for me if not only when I follow the company on LinkedIn that the follow also attaches to all other applications including Amazon on the Meta Platform.  

Thank you!
