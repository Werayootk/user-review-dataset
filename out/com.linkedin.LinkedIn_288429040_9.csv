It is full of job postings that are full of lies are misinformation, and LinkedIn has zero interest in holding these companies accountable. It is very common to see a job posting with the label of ‚Äúentry level‚Äù but the company then goes on to say, but actually you need 2+ years prior experience, which is 2+ years away from being an entry level job. Or a job that says in the title $30-$35 an hour. But then in the description the company says you can make ‚Äúup to $20 an hour‚Äù. Not only does this app not have a way to report these, they ignore your email when you take the extra time to tell them about it. Thus, it odd evident that they don‚Äôt care what the companies say on their job postings, as long as the sheep keep using the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-28T05:37:24-07:00

10627443252,Not-Mozart,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142642276,9.1.343,1,API calls make UI stall,"EDIT: v9.1.343 is still wildly broken. Now touch events often stop working when you scroll on the main feed. If you scroll past something, stop and scroll back you‚Äôll end up scrolling past it up then down, then up, then down, then up ‚Äî you will not be able to stop the scroll on the post you want to see unless you set your phone down an take a deep breath in between each scroll. This app was QA‚Äôed by a donut. Extremely buggy on iOS on iPhone 12 max. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reinstalled. There‚Äôs some very badly managed API calls that feel like it‚Äôs using jQuery instead of a modern MVC framework causing every other scroll to click instead. I don‚Äôt understand why it became so much worse, or how QA engineers let this out the door. It‚Äôs very badly managed developers and software. This was not an issue at all a couple years ago, shortly after Microsoft bought LinkedIn. It is however unsurprising that the UI became much worse after MS got involved and MS has no design cycle nor do they have a QA cycle so it‚Äôs absolutely likely the UI will continue to get worse. Sigh, hopefully I‚Äôll land a job so I don‚Äôt need to use this broken and frustrating UI much longer. The most frustrating part it I tried to tell LinkedIn and the customer support claimed the couldn‚Äôt replicate, which is funny because I tested on several iPhones. It‚Äôs gaslighting on their part. The whole customer support experience also reminded e of Microsoft, where thy just don‚Äôt believe you and assume the customer is doing something wrong. I don‚Äôt think they want to fix it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-26T05:31:43-07:00
