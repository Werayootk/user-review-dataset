11067347661,I am Saruto.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1637708910,1.2024.074,5,"Absolutely amazing, and i have some suggestions for fixes","The AI seems to be unable to change the way it types. When asked to make a typo or not use exclamation marks, it was unable to, tho it still thinks it could (ironically with a ! at the end of each message). 
When asked to form pictures from text, it struggles greatly. Tho it can somewhat do it, the picture can be unrecognizable at times. 
You cannot be in a low-wifi area or the AI simply wont respond, so I can only sometimes use it during school. 
It is very clear that it is programmed with certain biases, even if it can be made to admit that the biases it has are baseless. Like in one conversation I asked the AI about it being considered alive, and that even biological organisms technically have “coding”. It was very bent on saying that it was absolutely in no way ever possible of being considered living, despite admitting that that it is an ongoing debate and that nothing on the subject is definitive and proven to be true. 
I also think it would be cool if the speaker that can read the text to you, could be manipulated so that it can talk faster or slower. To me, the speaker speaks terribly slowly for the essays the messages tend to become. 
I also notice that sometimes it does get information wrong, but that it can be corrected most of the time by asking it to fix itself, tho it is strange to have to need to ask it to check its answers, I feel there should already be a system where it checks its answers BEFORE sending. Tho this isn’t a big problem, the amount of mistakes it has made is very small, and the mistakes are usually benign. 

Otherwise it has been extremely helpful in pretty much all things, without even needing to get any premium version.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-20T19:26:14-07:00
