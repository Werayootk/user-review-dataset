Setting certain transactions as repeating payments is a very nice feature for subscriptions and under the “Payments” tab you can see these recurring payments. I like that you can add notes, tags and receipts to every transaction. The budgeting tool is not very helpful to me personally, but the Trends feature is - it helps to see how you’re using your money. The Pots have a “scheduled payments” option, but it should really say “scheduled transfers” because Pots are not for making payments - they are just to set money aside. To use money from Pots you have to transfer it back to main account. If I could make payments directly from a “Bills” Pot with its own account number then “scheduled payments” would make sense and would be a very useful feature. Spend (checking), Savings and Bills - if I had a separate account number for these three along with some cash back or rewards options on purchases, it would be the perfect banking app for me.

It took 3 days for someone to respond to my initial message, but apparently the issue was too difficult for that agent, so they needed a “specialist” to get involved. More than two weeks later waiting for someone to get back to me and multiple “we’re so sorry, we guarantee a specialist will get back to you ASAP,” I asked them to close my account. They assured me again it would be resolved quickly, but there was nothing they could do in the meantime. After 3 weeks from my application, I received an email from someone called Eugene telling me that not only did they close my account, but I will never be allowed to open an account with them again?
