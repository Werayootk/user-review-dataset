Regularly I’d come across transphobia, homophobia, ableism, etc. and id respond to some of them and several of them reported me for maybe swearing at them- no hate speech or threats or wishes of violence. I got banned from the site. For swearing at transphobic people for being transphobic. It’s about who reposts who first. Their “crackdown” or something on hate speech was to just “permanently suspend” (ban) any reports. So essentially, they ban anyone who’s seemingly reported on and even reporting hate speech I even got “reporting abuse” as a threat. So then I couldn’t report hate speech and got banned for responding to hate speech. They don’t actually respond to appeals- boilerplate responses that don’t make any sense. They often “link” to supposedly offending comment that literally says “erased by Reddit”, well how am I supposed to respond and appeal if you don’t tell me what’s actually wrong with the comment. It’s about who reports who first and even then they’ll ban you for reporting. I had a ten year account never ran into these problems until 2023.

Toss your money into the oblivion and prepare to be totally ignored by Reddit’s staff.

Update for 2023: I got permanently suspended for “abuse of the report function” which I don’t even know how is possible. I’ve only ever reported heinous bullying and hatred. I tried to appeal and their response was emailing me to tell me that subreddits are run by mods who can do what they want (I wasn’t banned from a subreddit, but Reddit as a whole, which was clear from my appeal) and then banning all of my other accounts permanently as well.

Whenever I’m searching for an answer to a hard-to-word question, including “reddit” in the search terms always reveals a ton of better answers than the ads & lists which make up most google results.

The Reddit app is a different case altogether. Whenever I try the above approach on my phone, the site promises “this page looks better in the app.” Even with it already installed, these links just go to the App Store, rather than opening that page in the Reddit app. This just makes the whole thing feel useless - searching Reddit directly isn’t particularly accurate, so I end up just trying to ignore the button and view the results in the browser.

The issue isn’t so much with the app as with those links. They’re essentially just one big redirect to the App Store, rather than something useful which automatically opens that page in the Reddit app (and only goes to the store if the app is not installed). This may seem like a little thing, but it also seems like an easy fix, and the fact that I run into this almost every day makes all of those little irritations really add up.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-22T05:38:46-07:00

These 3rd party apps include Apollo, RIF, Narwhal and others. All of these apps had many dedicated users who loved using them to post, moderate and comment on Reddit. Despite this, Reddit got greedy and decided to kill them. In addition to this, the official Reddit app is actual garbage compared to 3rd party apps. It is full of ads, less intuitive and much slower. Instead of working with 3rd party app developers to either negotiate a reasonable price or improve their app, they choose to be selfish and spit in the face of their most dedicated users. To add further insult to injury, Reddit’s CEO decided to falsely accuse Apollo’s developer of blackmail in an attempt to make themselves look better.

This update butchered the video player that I was very content with, which is my main point of contention. It is clearly trying to mimic the “scrolling feed” that has become standard for most social media apps, but the reality is that most people come to reddit because they don’t want that crap. I have no desire to tap on a video and get brought to a blatant tiktok ripoff video player, in which I can swipe up and see content completely unrelated to the subs I am subscribed to.

The mod and appeal system is a joke, because the mod that made the ban refuses to change their mind. The app is broken half the time and doesn’t work. Either server error or try again later. 

I never bully or harass anyone. My latest ban was because I gave my opinion on a post that someone asked for opinions. Yes that’s it. The mods reasoning was “don’t yuck someone else’s yum”. The OP was literally asking for fashion advice. I was civil and simply stated I didn’t like ONE out of the 7 outfits in question. That resulted in my account being temporary banned for 7 days.

They allow anyone to be moderators and if they don’t agree with you, they can do whatever they want. I see many bullying comments that get ignored.

I think the portrait orientation of the app is fine, but landscape just has so much wasted screen space. I think that extra space can be used to be more like the desktop version of Reddit to give the iPad a more unique experience rather than just feeling like an upscaled iOS version for iPadOS. There’s plenty of space in the left (or right) margin to utilize the profile menu that is normally hidden, as well as using the other margin for in-subreddit sidebars.

I have tried other 3rd party Reddit apps and find that this one is the best for me. It’s easy to navigate and play with and does have some nice features for finding new subs and whatever. Does the basic functions of Reddit pretty well, as it should. 

HOWEVER

The app is constantly being “improved” with god awful UI quirks to make it some form of “better.” The app is constantly fixing what isn’t broken. Just getting used to a certain feature of the app? Yeah, they’ll change it to something even more awkward and unusable in a few months. The most recent video player change makes NO sense and I don’t know of a single user I’ve interacted with that actually thinks it’s a good idea. 

As I mentioned before the site is really good at the basics of Reddit. And it should focus on being the best app for those basic features of the site! Stop messing with all the controls every few months and releasing updates that are just out of wack, for no good reason!

Is it a social media site where you can share posts with friends? Apparently not. They take their internet “karma” points so seriously that if you interact with the same posts and comments as your friends and family, Reddit will flag all of your accounts as voter manipulation. This especially occurs if the people are using the same wifi. Reddit has serious issues with revenge P, bullying, and misinformation, yet it appears in their agenda to go after small families with warnings and suspensions for upvoting the same comments. A website/company that goes after their small users for sharing posts with their immediate family is not one that I want to recommend to others. And, a company that cannot separate true vote manipulation - ie bots and software - from a family socializing and bonding over Reddit posts, is a site that needs to reevaluate whether it is a social site at all.

Which isn’t all bad. The flaw is people avoid being ostracized leading to more censored takes killing any actual constructive engagement. Example you ask questions about help with a car person A: this is the issue I ran into and how I resolved it. Person B: I’m a mechanic and wouldn’t recommend it because x,y,z. The community may mob either a or b because A, “you shouldn’t give advice you’re lucky that worked”. Or B: “your wrong because my uncles third cousin yada yada” 

The good thing about the app is it’s very easy to farm karma by either agreeing with the echo chamber, dog piling, or having general states to play on emotions. 

Recommendation, if you plan to use the app have two accounts. One for actually engaging and getting down voted into oblivion and a second one to have reserved, general takes, well farming karma if you want. It’s not a serious app because anything nuance is a bomb. For gaming, hobbies, and so on it will work well as there isn’t as much of a mob mentality.

The ONE time I shared my own personal experience with wanting advice about cutting off a sibling, Reddit refused to post it. Not only that, but I got an incredibly nasty message from a modifier saying I didn’t use a “trigger warning” and that I’m not allowed to talk about what someone else does. So essentially, I was not allowed to discuss reasons I felt my sibling was not a good person? I got a permanent ban. Meanwhile, there are posts on there about illegal substance usage, people cheating on spouses, and worse..I can’t share a story about growing up with a sibling I don’t get along with???
I’ve since deleted Reddit. There is NO free speech on that platform and the cowardly modifiers  have absolutely no lives with far too much “power” behind their computer screens.

The whole system of selecting posts to view is broken to me. swiping up or down like in tiktok does not show the previous or next video in the sub, it shows a random slightly connected video forcing you to swipe out of any post to view the next in the sub.

Don’t use Reddit if you have any questions. They will most likely have a bot that doesn’t understand English and blocks your comment even though you haven’t broken any rules. This is okay but then it will stop you from trying to post your question again. It will say “wait 20 mins your posting to fast” I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO POST! What are you talking about ? 
This is a very small problem which made millions of people decide Reddit isn’t worth it.

If you have a question your not gonna get an answer let alone be able to post your question.

Overall the app is fine, but there are some frustrating bugs that make me switch to a different social media site more frequently than I did before: 

- The app is very inconsistent when it comes to marking posts as read. If I read it from one feed it’s marked read in that feed but then if I navigate to the subreddit it’s not marked read there. 
- The back button frequently gets stuck on a post and freezes the app to one post. The only way to get out is to force quit. 

This wouldn’t be that annoying, but I prefer to navigate Reddit by looking at one subreddit at a time for the most part. So, to get back to a different subreddit on the app, you have to double tap back past the home feed and to the side nav every time. And since it doesn’t keep track of your state and frequently freezes during that flow, it makes browsing for me overall pretty clunky. I wouldn’t mind the double tap back if it actually worked consistently. 

I landed on 3 stars because I do frequently  give up on the app and do something else for a while, and certainly spend less time browsing than I did before.

You might not even notice if you didn’t say anything terrible and don’t post much on that account. Again, sub mods can and do perma ban for the most polite and well reasoned comments. And if you start using Reddit enough, soon you might make a mistake and accidentally comment somewhere you were banned from, like my comment recently, “100%,” I said to someone, on a sub I didn’t know I was banned from. I researched it and I had posted a single polite comment disagreeing with someone about a controversial topic more than 4 months ago. Then, according to Reddit I was trying to circumvent a ban. 7 day suspension. I am a veteran Reddit user and commenter and this took me one step closer to never using Reddit again.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-05T05:00:45-07:00

In some if not all of the communities it says I can’t post images. Now before you say, “some communities don’t allow images” in the subreddit I was in it LITERALLY had a flair titled “IMAGES” I even scrolled through and saw people posting images left and right but on mine it says it’s not allowed. I closed out the app, logged out, reseted my entire fricking iPad, and it still wouldn’t let me. I found out by doing some digging that it isn’t just me who is having this problem. This has to be fixed because I can’t even enjoy the app anymore. I always love posted OC art on subreddits but now I can’t. I spent 5 days making art for r/Pokémon for nothing due to this bug. Please fix it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-26T22:39:53-07:00

I get the community engaged with my posts. Please, please, please as one human speaking to another human during a pandemic with the world in chaos mode can you please have some sympathy/empathy. I sincerely apologize to the MOD(s) I may have exchanged words with. I honestly just thought it was a robot. Please I ask you to restore my account. I have learned my lesson.

7532516232,froggyfriend420,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id984810456,2021.25.0,2,Latest updates are ruining this app,"I am a long time user of the Reddit mobile app and haven’t had any problems up until the release of the latest updates. One major problem is the new video player. Any time you try to open a gif or video, you’re forced to view it in Tik Tok format. It is absolutely dreadful to try and read the comment section of posts with this sort of media. This new feature alone makes the app borderline unusable.

Another issue with the latest updates is that the home feed is now filled with posts from communities that you are not subscribed to. If I wanted to see that content, I would be following those communities, so seeing those posts on my feed is annoying.

It is very clear that they are trying to mimic the features of other social media, and in doing so, they are ruining the app. A lot of what made this app good in the first place was the fact that it wasn’t like every other social media. Tons of Reddit users have voiced their dislike for these new features and things need to be fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-02T16:47:36-07:00

My parents followed it closely and when I admitted truths, they punished me badly. So I made an alternate account they didn’t know about as to not cause drama. And they deleted both my accounts for “circumventing a ban” in another subreddit that I’d never been in before, they got my accounts confused with another persons. So I made another account. Same thing happened, they thought that was connected to an account of a person I didn’t even know. They banned me for lying about being banned from r/AmITheAssHole, which I have never been banned from. They cited a comment that was the apparent “lie”. The comment was, and I’m not kidding, asking for plant advice. So that account got banned. Since then, any account I’ve made has been permanently banned within HOURS. Their frickin’ site is ran on a potato. I can’t even just browse Reddit in peace or have fun because they made a mistake a long time ago and refuse to admit it, thus every account I’ve had, despite never even doing anything wrong, has been deleted for “circumventing a subreddit ban”. Screw this app, wouldn’t recommend it, 1 star",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-18T20:16:06-07:00

Whenever I come across a Reddit page in Safari that I like and it gives me the option to open it in the app, all it does is take me to Reddit’s page in the App Store, instead of opening that Reddit page in the actual Reddit app. This drives me crazy and seems like it should’ve been one of the first things fixed, and yet it still persists to this day! Now granted it might just be me getting old and not knowing how to use technology like the youngins’ haha. However, it seems to me that it simply shouldn’t be that difficult to open the app to the page you were viewing in safari. I don’t know if it’s just with apple products or if other smartphone users have the same problem, but that’s my reason for a 4 out of 5. Hope this helps in someway or another!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-02T14:08:59-07:00

10045005447,Blindfromthebeginning,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1488312976,2023.23.1,3,Update seriously broke accessibility for voiceover users,Multiple reply buttons all over the screen used to show up when replying to a message and it was hard to guess which reply button would reply to your message.  Now when replying to a message all that’s on the screen is multiple instances of the same advertisement and reply button is nowhere to be found.  Nobody is going to develop for reddit and pay those api prices outside of reddit itself unless Microsoft or some other deep pockets corp does reddit development in the future.  I’m going to delete this app and if I have reason to think of reddit in a year’s time I’ll try the app again then and see if it’s anymore useable than now.  I’m leaving for hive and I’m not happy doing this since there were communities on reddit I found interesting.  Appollo was taken down and for voiceover users appollo was the best accessibility app available for reddit on the iphone.
