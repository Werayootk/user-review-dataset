But, I just have to say that I really don’t like the new update. It takes sooo much longer to jus figure out what you need to say. It’s not easier to use than typing, and it’s definitely not faster to use than typing. And, you can’t say anything that you need/want to say! I mean, I understand about people cussing, or saying bad things n stuff, but you can’t talk to people like normal human beings. So it would be AmAzInG if you took the new update off. Also, it would be pretty cool to have like a, friending thing, so you can like, friend people you like or sum. Thank you!
So I wrote that a while ago, but now I have to add something. My name in the game was supppp, and when I tried to play, it said that the “game server refused the name supppp” and I was like, what? Why? It’s literally the most generic name ever. And I’ve had that name since I got Among Us, and now all of the sudden, it’s not letting me use it! So I’m a bit upset about that. Also, the game would allow sup, but nothing with repeated “P’s” on it and I have no idea why. Plz fix. Thanks so much! :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-02T11:32:34-07:00

I need to sign in now I mean it’s kinda good but I can’t sign in because of my Apple ID. Also I can’t choose my own name. I don’t know why I mean I seen people like before have like some inappropriate names but you just like ban or kick them and also you can’t say what you want it chat. So when the new update came me and my cousin were like gonna have so much fun but we both couldn’t change our names and she likes like certain names for people to call her (she likes to be called FNAF names) and I can’t say them so it’s soooo annoying. I liked this game but I just gave up on it. Every like month I go in the game for like 3 seconds and then I get bored. Before I loved this game and as the new things came in I wish they never happened (in a respect way).That’s just my opinion. People actually really like this update but I’m just not one of them. I am not saying like this game is the worst and you choice never get it. You should get this game but this is my opinion.

Around April 1st (we there was an April fools day update), the game has been messed up for me on both devices. When the lobby time hits “0” to start a game, it takes 30 seconds for my game to start. When my game starts, everyone else has been playing for at least 20 seconds. Often times the game will start for me and I’m already dead, or someone has already set off a sabotage. Other things to note, it makes me login every time I open the game. Just keep me logged in, or stop making us login altogether. Here recently, it won’t let me type in the chat in games or in the lobby. I had that problem some time last month, but I found out the problem was I wasn’t logged in. Now I’m logged in and the chat won’t work for me. The game is based off of typing and chatting to other people, why is that even an option, for the chat to not work? That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I haven’t played the game in well over a week, because I literally can’t type, and I’ve tried everything except deleting the app and re-downloading. And if I do ever delete the app, I most likely won’t be downloading it again, because the quality of the game has simply dissipated.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-28T06:40:59-07:00

I only ever really play Among us to connect with other people who like Anime , and I really use enjoy the game ( most of the time ) but it has gotten where there is no freedom to do anything basically. I never type any bad stuff like curse words or inappropriate things . I do get that you where just trying to protect your game from becoming one of those games that just has people cussing and saying really depressing things but now I don’t even want to play it . I use to really like this game now it has gone to complete trash ( I’m really sorry for saying that i just had to say it because it’s true and again I’m so so sorry ) Please , if there is a way where you could just take away inappropriate language it would be great .

And just a cute fun idea you can make a custom hat for your character for 3-5 dollars it would be super cool!

7035166382,2010bird,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id134812746,2020.11.17,3,Fun! But some issues,"Hi! I really like among us and I think it is a very good game but I do have a few suggestions. Number one is that maybe you could add a limit to camera time? Like you can look at security cams for ten seconds but then you have to stay away from them for one minute. Because it is really hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras because then they could call an emergency meeting and put it in the chat and I really don’t think that’s fair. Number two is the names. When I tried to name myself the name “ Grape”, like the fruit,it said the server didn’t approve of that name. But when I am in a game, here comes a player with a bad word or some thing inappropriate as a name and I’m very confused. Why did the server approve of that name but it didn’t approve of the name Grape. It even let me do the name Grapes but not Grape so I am very confused. Also it is annoying when people are being rude in the chat because then you have to wait the entire game until you can kick or ban them. Also, it is annoying when hackers and other things like come into the game and they are annoying to. But overall this is a really fun game and it is amazing and I really enjoy playing it! Have a great day!:)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-24T19:06:34-07:00

But one thing, when I disconnect from games, it says “you may not join another game for 5 minutes because you were intentionally disconnecting”. Sometimes I have to leave games, like when I have to go to school, or when I have sports and stuff. But a couple days ago this was SUPER frustrating, because this weird glitch happened where I wanted 3 imposters, but it only did one, and the background would go black and it would be SO annoying. And today, when I left just one game, it said I couldn’t join for another 10 minutes. This is super annoying and it needs work, because this can be really annoying. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn’t rage quit or anything.
The reason I gave this 4 stars is because of that reason, and sometimes when I just want to be an imposter I disconnect from games and stuff, so yeah. But other than that this game is totally great! I totally would have given this review 5 stars but because of the disconnecting thing, that drops my rate a little.
But anyways yeah! This game is great, and it’s so worth the buy!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-26T06:02:25-07:00

I see bad reviews just because of a couple of hackers that ruined a couple games for the player. It is not very hard to leave a game and find a new one. 2) they can’t get into a game because it is “full”. The people that have this issue probably always pick the lobby that already has 8-9 out of ten people in it. You need to be smart about what lobby you pick, like a 5-6 out of ten lobby. Then, you can get into a game and have a good time with other people. Please don’t be a snowflake and delete the game because a couple of hackers made you mad. Also, people that keep requesting friend systems, you will get it soon. The game developers just canceled the second game and are deciding to just add what they wanted for the second game to the first one. They have wanted friend requests for a while and I’m betting that will be one of the first big updates. Again this is an amazing game and I have had very few problems with it.

With quick chat the only things I can say to interact with someone is hello or nice outfit. Also when we are voting I can’t describe a situation the only bit of customization I get in quick chat is adding names. To make it worse the only way I can change it is asking my parents and them being nice people they said yes. Though they put their foot down when the game asked for a small amount of money or a SSN and no matter how much convincing they said no after this app asked for that. Since I was not able to use quick chat or any other features I deleted the app, but my cousins are all above eighteen and during the recent holidays one of there phones couldn’t download the game so they used this device. Even after deleting the app all the previous information stayed so when my family wanted to play even they were unable to use free chat though they were different people.

Tiny characters try to find out the imposter(s) that is secretly killing the crew-mates one by one until there’s only them left. All though, ever since the sign in and quick chat update, I have been playing the game less and less until I eventually deleted it. In my honest opinion, I think among us was more popular and played more before that update. The update in my opinion has ruined the gameplay experience we all had before. A lot of people (like me) are not able to sign in with Apple ID and/or Email. And mostly kids with apple products such as iPads, iPhones, Mac books, etc are not able to sign in to be able to get the best experience they can get while chatting with people to figure out the imposter. Overall, the gameplay, the experience, and the people that play it are great! But a lot of people are quitting because of the new update, and the update is lacking the experience and fun we all had before the release of the new update.

I understand that now you can sign up to type again but I have friends who cannot do that and I find it rather silly that typing was removed in the first place and now half the people cannot talk in full sentences, say something with actual emotion, or even defend themselves when being accused. I think it’s ridiculous that to type you need to sign up and I feel like this response wheel thing was made for small children but 1.  Any child who can play among us, murder people, and find imposters should be allowed the right to talk and 2. Anyone too young to do any of the things previously listed should not even be playing the game in the first place. Because of the previous statements and facts I believe that everyone should be able to type, when people can’t it completely ruins the game for them and everyone else (also can I mention the fact that they felt the need to add the word “yeet” to the wheel yet they couldn’t bother to make full sentences)

Except ever since the updates came out....I hated it. I honestly don't want to play the game anymore. First of all, the quickchat update is horrible. At first i did my real age and it wouldn't let me type. Then i re downloaded the game to where i was literally a one hundred years old and i still wasn't aloud ti type what ever i want. The quickchat update is an oxymoron. It says quick but it takes way longer to figure out what you Want ti say and find it instead of just typing it. It takes away all the fun. Another thing is it won't let me change my name. Whenever i try to change my name it doesn't work. My cousin said i have to go to the profile thing but it still doesn't  work. This might just be me, but it wont let me chose my name so i have to be something dumb like slipperyunicorn. Again it is still kinda fun but i would have given it five stars before the update came. The only reason why i gave it one star instead of zero is because the new map is kinda cool. Among is creators, if you read this, PLEASE do something about the quickchat to where you can like turn it on/off in your settings or something like that.

I hope this excites y’all for future Among Us!

Don't get me wrong- I was extremely excited for the new update!(thinking it might be that viral idea of you being able to friend people) but honestly- this isn’t as exciting as that idea. The new map is cool and the new loading screen but..the naming has been bothering me. Basically, you have to press the randomly generated button for a random name. I get why the creator(s) added this (to prevent inappropriate names) but..what if you wanna be named ‘banana’ or something else innocent. I think it would have worked better by banning all the names that are inappropriate but spelt wrong. For example ‘Sx’ or more ‘almost’ inappropriate names. Another part of the update I don’t appreciate is where you can’t text. Basically, they got rid of the chatting. The only thing you could do is get options of things you wanna say like ‘where was the body found?’. The reason they added this (I think) is to present the same thing. Still, I think the way to fix this is to do the same thing with the names.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-01T09:42:26-07:00

As soon as we figured that out we ALL deleted the game. And there was about 10 or 9 of us. A few months later, we downloaded it thinking maybe they took it off, BUT IT WAS EVEN WORSE! you couldn’t even choose your own USER!! How ridiculous! U had to randomly choose it and if u want to choose it u had to sign up or whatever. And it’s been 2 years since I deleted it. The only reason I gave this five stars is for people to see this you know.

It’s very hard to communicate, and the options are limited. This would be fine should the quickchat be more varied, but you can’t even say “sus” which is literally the basis word of the game - it’s just wrong. I understand that you might’ve done it out of child protection for people who use profanity, (I’m assuming that there was no legal reason for this and it was just to make parents approve of you more) but most people don’t use profanity (I didn’t see it that much before quickchat). My suggestion is either to remove the quickchat entirely or make it determined to the third party user, like Apple screen time. They don’t just limit their devices to the daily recommendation of screen time, they let it be determined by the third party user. I would really appreciate it if you did this, because I’ve had to stop playing because I can’t communicate my thoughts and it’s really slowing the game down. The fact that I couldn’t even communicate basic ideas like “come watch me do scan” was really a blow. And some of the options are just downright useless - “Was this a dead body or emergency meeting?” Do we need that!? It literally tells you!

I do not like the fact that you have to can’t change your name without having an account because that is very annoying I loved my name but then I had to set up an account and now I cannot choose my name and I’m stuck with the stupid ones and I don’t want to set up an account because I am under the age of 18 therefore I will have to use the quick chat feature. The layout of the game is so buggy right now, I do not like the fact that there are boxes around the maps right now, the quickchat feature does not look good, and the task bar shows up during meetings right now. What I am saying over all is that the quickchat feature messes up a lot of things, the whole account business is Bogas, and the game does not look nice and is overwhelming sometimes.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-02T20:15:32-07:00

But there are 2 things wrong with it... you know whenever you finish a game but that quit button the X yea that one... it’s annoying sometimes I accidentally press it sometimes and it immediately makes me lose the game ITS SO ANNOYING! there should be an option that say... are you sure you want to leave? And it will say yes or no. The other problem is that people always ban for no reason like for getting imposter and winning they always ban me for that... there should be an option of why you want to ban or kick someone. Over all that this game is truly amazing!  

Edit: ok I’m mad at the game now it said I was hacking but I wasn’t. You know the thing that says you were banned for hacking. Please stop. I wasn’t hacking the game is dumb for thinking that I just wanted to keep playing the game but it banned me for no reason FIX THIS

The colors don’t really matter to me but I have noticed something strange. Sometimes in the game it picks certain colors to be the imposters and not random colors. How you play is your a imposter or crewmate and a crewmate goes around doing tasks to fix the ship. The imposters go around killing the crewmates . When you are dead nobody except other ghosts can see you. Their is a chat so you can talk to people. You can call emergency meetings or report body’s . Amazing game and I definitely recommend! I also noticed that once I was playing but nobody could move, vote, talk in the chat.

There are private servers so you and your friends can have a separate servers from other people. But you can also play with other online users. But there is a few things wrong with the game. Like a lot of times there is a total glitch out to were the device you play on wont work on the game for a few days. And it is very easy to hack into the game and cheat which i think is annoying when people do that because a lot of people like to enjoy the game. There is also some cyber bullying on the game or harassment to total strangers. And in that case i think you should be able to report acconuts so they can get banned because it is not ok to do any of those types of things. I have also had to delete the app a lot because of the bugs and glitches; the game seems to have updates a lot but the bugs and glitches are still on the game. I really enjoy this game but sometimes it is annoying when i have to keep re-downloading the app. But over all it is a fun and addicting game to play and pass time.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-26T16:54:57-07:00

When we were playing the map was backwards, I called a meeting in the game and then this hacker said “ Purple you are going to be kicked for hacking. I am going to report to Apple and make them ban the game from you.” It wasn’t true. And I was the color purple. An example of false hacking. I was playing a game and I was my usual color, white, and then I had a name. When we were playing and I called a meeting I could not see myself! My name was Luke and my color was blue. And I promise I did not change it at all. But when it was voting time there were two blues and to blacks. Whoever made this game can you please make it to where there are no free hacks. That would help the game a lot! 😀 So please update the app to where there are no hackers in the game! And also the new update that you put is trash.

They can steal your personal information so don’t play until there is an update that blocks hackers. It’s happened to me 10 times now and it doesn’t stop. It’s also happened to many other people. They basically put a ton of messages with links and telling you that if you don’t join the “Trump 2020” (can’t remember what it’s called) that they’ll hack your device. And then your server turns dark and everything becomes hacked. They can even get your IP address so PLEASE DON’T DOWNLOAD IT! And DELETE IT ASAP!

UPDATE: The hacker is gone. However, the game’s update has sort of ruined it. There’s now so many variations of colors that it’s not so simple anymore. Not to mention, literally every server is role-playing (most often, MHA). It’s very difficult to find a normal server that has normal people. You know, people who aren’t being inappropriate or constantly saying, “*turns head* Where did Deku go?” So, I’m going to have to delete the game. I only got it because my younger siblings wanted me to play with them. But they’re uninterested now, as well.

And with friends, it’s really fun. One thing that I don’t like about this game is the Quick Chat, ok so I know that it can get frustrating when you need to type fast but when you look for options in Quick Chat, that also takes a while. There are some things that a player needs to say that are not in Quick Chat such as: “I have a scan etc.”. I really think that you should allow people to type and have Quick Chat at the same time. It really been hard for me to deal with Quick Chat and that’s why I have been playing this game less. There are also these hackers going around every game and giving the players links and then just leaving the game after that. I think that we should do something about those hackers,   the links that the give could give the hackers the players address etc. I know that these hackers are red with a suit and they have three names: sire sirol, eris loris, and ersi losi. Please do something about these hackers!

I understand that some people tried using the chat to do weird stuff but that’s their problem to deal with, before the new feature came out where it’s limited words you could say are used to join servers where they would try to online date and get other people Snapchat. The reason why I am giving this app a three is because of the new chat feature I was really excited to play the new map though and I thought they would get rid of the Word feature but they didn’t so if inner sloth sees this can you please remove the chat feature. It also takes a very long time to say what you’re going to say because you have to go to different areas and sometimes it’s hard because you don’t know where the chat is and some people set the discussion time to 15 seconds and it’s really hard to do that in under 15 seconds.

You can play with friends or just random people, and it’s really a blast. If it wasn’t for a couple minor mistakes, I would give this game five stars. One problem is the lag that you get at the start of the game sometimes. Another is that imposter rate feels lower than it should for me, but that’s not the game’s fault because imposter is up to chance. My main complaint with this game is joining public lobbies. They get full immediately, so even if it shows up you can’t join. You have to click as fast as you can to join a game just to have a chance to get in. Sometimes when joining, it stops you due to the matchmaker being full or the fact that my game is not updated, which is false, I have the latest update so it shouldn’t do that. And when the lobby you join doesn’t kick you because it’s full, it has like 2 people in it and you have to wait for a long period of time. If somehow you could make the non full lobbies more popular, this game would be 5 stars no doubt.

Also it should have a progressively higher punishment for people who just leave the game for not getting imposter. Imagine you sit in the same lobby 12 times and finally get imposter. You hear 5 beeps. Half the lobby is gone and you kill twice and win the game. Boring. And I don’t really get why the punishment for hacking is less then the punishment for leaving the game.

When you shoot it, it bounces around the map until it hits something, when someone gets it, the effect is cool, and the body is glowing. It can kill imposters.

First I would say when I would join a 1/10 game it would say it’s full or it started or I need to update and all that, so if you could maybe just make it so that if a player joins a server, then it shows 2/10 or 3/10 and so on and so on so that people know that it is full. Next thing is that you should make accounts and make it so that you can friend people since I have met good people and sooner or later it says an error happened and I don’t get to see them again so please add that. 2 more things is that you should up the chance of getting imposter since I always get crewmate and then I really hate that. And I end up having to leave since i already been a crewmate the past 100 games so please do that.

Sometimes it’s people who troll with unbalanced settings, but that’s not the games fault. Second, there’s always a few players that leave as soon as the game starts just because they didn’t get imposter but the game has a built in feature that implements a temporary a ban if they leave intentionally too many times. But sometimes it happens to me when I get kicked or disconnected. I almost never leave on purpose but it still happens? But lastly, I often run into players that either discord cheat and call meetings accusing other players because “their friend told them on call”, or sometimes players that team with the imposter to vote out other players even when they’re crewmate, or worst of all: players that are shamelessly hacking with no kill cooldown or multiple sabotages at once etc, which is why we definitely need a report feature.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-06T08:29:26-07:00

6545112754,Lexi Hale,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id914140007,2020.9.9,5,Amazing Game needs a couple Improvements,"Let me start by saying i LOVE this game, it's the only game i truly feel i will never get bored playing. There's just a few improvements that should be added. Firstly, we need an ""add friend"" button so that way we can play with people we have met through the game! I posted this in a facebook Among Us group and most people strongly agree we should have the option to add other players as friends and have a friend list. Also, there should be a penalty if a player leaves a game, like maybe they have to wait 10 minutes to play another game. Too often players will leave a game right away because they aren't impostor, which makes it harder on the other crewmates. That should not be allowed without a penalty. Other than that, the game is really good. You could try expanding it to 15 or 20 players a game or something and maybe allow more impostors as well, but all in all the game is pretty much perfect! Everyone would really appreciate it if you added these features i think! :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-17T08:42:26-07:00

I love the hats, I love the colors for your skin, and I love everything! Hope you are making more great games like this one! InnerSloth is the bomb! One thing. Now I can’t get in online. It keeps saying My “apple ID account” can’t generate or whatever because of a “new update” being unable to install…soooo yeah pls fix that other than that this game is amazing.  (New Edit To My Review) DUDE WHAT IS HAPPENING?! I can’t buy anything like stars that cost money oh AND I still can’t play online so please fix that.

Third Update 
Hello InnerSloth devs. Thank you for responding to my review. I just have one grievance. We haven’t gotten more cosmicubes that you can buy with beans in a LONG TIME. I have all the cosmicubes that cost beans and I have more than 25,000 saved up for the next one. Please 🙏 make another cosmicubes that we can buy with beans. But that was my one thing. I’m Level 67, and enjoying the game. Thank you for taking your time to read this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-30T15:41:16-07:00
9295694326,LilThugga95,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1372585144,2022.10.25,3,I love among us. I have among us merch!!!,"Absolutely love this app. However… I need it to allow me to STAY signed in and not have to sign in every time… no other app makes me sign in every time other than banking apps. Also, this issue with signing in with my apple is going to cause me to delete the app entirely bc every so often, there is a sign in issue. If I can’t sign in then I have to use the preset chat options, which I’m not gonna do. I’m not gonna play if I have to do that. So I hope fixing that is top priority right now. And another thing, the friend system needs to be based on the names WE CHOOSE not yaw generated names. No one even knows their own generated names much less someone else’s. We all know each other by the names we play with in game. We get bonded to these people and then lose them forever lol. Well I hope my suggestions really help yaw develop the game a little better. I am still a big player and have been since it came out. 

EDIT: there should also be a thing that tells you what friends are online. I put money into this game and would continue to if these features were added/fixed. Thanks!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-16T07:13:46-07:00

6699777986,sigejsis,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1220012121,2020.11.17,4,Great game but comes with issues,"This is my new favorite game, and it’s really fun to play. I love the concept and I play it all the time but there are a couple of glitches I’d like to acknowledge. 
First off, it keeps telling me I am running an older version of the app and I need to update but when I go to check, there are no updates available. 
2nd, I got voted off because someone saw me vent, and then I left because I wanted to play a new round since I had been voted off. It told me I cannot play another round for 5 minutes because I had intentionally disconnected, when I left like 3 minutes into the game for a reason. I understand that people leave on purpose because they didn’t get imposter, but I didn’t leave right away and I left for a reason. 
And lastly, I keep glitching into walls. I don’t know how it happens but I take a turn and suddenly I’ve glitched myself into a wall. Meaning I’ve trapped myself into a wall and have to find an edge were I can get out of the wall. 
And a suggestion for the freeplay, we would be able to customize our characters in freeplay as well.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-29T10:29:21-07:00
6711591698,strawberryJamin,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id726250165,2020.11.17,1,Uhm no- and this is why,"Among us. Good concept but terribly performed. This game has the worst community I have ever seen. Harassment, cheating and hacking are to name a few things that I’ve seen from the people here. Every day I went to play this game there are lobbies with people who harass me and others because it makes them feel powerful to put others down by words. People who fake being suicidal and when someone says they actually are, they are told to “get over it.” This game is full- and I mean full of people who enjoy harassing people and making others feel inferior. 
That’s not just the start of the problem. The many, many problems and glitches this game has. From taking 5+ minutes to find an open lobby that has decent game settings. And the glitches and disconnects while playing the game make the game even worse.
With the community and staggering number of problems the game is virtually unplayable. I cannot image what this game has put others through. This game does not deserve to be praised. 
I hope other people, developers or anyone else sees this and sees what actually happens within these public lobbies. The game is fun- if you have enough friends to play it. This game lets people be harassed constantly with no end and I’m done with it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-02T19:59:01-07:00

Yall are so talentedd 😌 I think the game is perfection 😃 buti have some suggestions! 1. I think we should be able to add friends. Sometimes very rarely you meet this one person you become great friends and then the host kicks you out! It would be amazing if you would add that! :) 2. A report button. Ok hear me out not a report button for dead bodys! But what if you had a report button to report hackers! I suggest this because half of the games i go into their are hackers! They just ruin the game! 3. Other roles. Now of course they would be diffrent game modes but if you add roles such as “Jester“ “Detective” I think that would be fun! 4. Notes, you should be able to have notes and pass them! But sometimes they would drop :( 5. More than 10 players it would be more fun with more players and maybe even a voice chat!? Anyways again this game is AMAZINNGG!!!!!!! And don’t feel pressured. Also if your reading it I hope your doing great ♡´･ᴗ･`♡",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-01T01:46:30-07:00
