It creates drafts that don’t go away after you send the email - so you look and think you haven’t replied because there’s an open draft. This is HORRIBLE if knowing whether you’ve replied is important to you. I’ve double-sent a few emails already. \n2. You can’t separate calendar integration. I’m running my calendar through a calendar app, so no reason for this to be fiddling with it. Creates redundancy and errors. \n3. Longer conversations are indented when reading back through the thread to the point you get a single character lines. Imagine trying to read a long email with one character per line. \n\nI still find it a better integration to Gmail than the native iOS Mail app, but only because Mail seems to not play nice with Gmail push notifications (as in I don’t get them). I’m not using Gmail (yet) because I was hoping to keep personal and work email notifications separate, BUT I may have to switch over.

Dare I say, the Outlook app is better in every way, except one.\n\nThe Outlook app doesn’t seem to store more than 30 days worth of emails locally on my phone. So if I needed to find an email from, say June 2017, I type it in the search bar and then I have to continue pressing the “Load more conversations” button ~60 times until the app finally syncs back far enough with the server to load the email. And then, once you close the app, it doesn’t save all of the emails you just loaded so now you have to start from the beginning the next time you search for an old email!!\n\nFrom trial and error, it seems to pull old emails in 2-week chunks, so god have mercy on your soul if you have to go back 5+ years.\n\nIt boggles my mind why this is a thing. I’ve looked through every single setting in the app and on the desktop web but there’s no option to extend this limit. Why not simply do one massive sync where you pull everything and then save a local copy on my phone so I can actually find what I’m looking for without spending 30 mins pinging the server over and over again?! Both the Gmail app and the Mail app do this.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-01-28T15:00:40-07:00"},{"id":"9791016421","userName":"esbrown1232","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id298126448","version":"4.2312.0","score":1,"title":"Don’t use unless you ads in your emails and not being able to see any emails at all","text":"Overnight Microsoft outlook seems to have updated the system and now my emails do not display.

I’m looking into POP3, but I can’t seem to figure that out either. I feel I may be lost without her. Outlook has been very supportive of me throughout this period. If we eventually divorce, I will be warmed by the kind blue glow of the Outlook application for iPad. That makes me feel like everything is going to be okay somehow.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-31T13:24:24-07:00"},{"id":"8304403005","userName":"Geocola","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id234629505","version":"4.2203.0","score":5,"title":"The Convenience of Outlook","text":"Been using Outlook for my emails for years, and I love the onvenience of being able to do so many things without the hassl e of logging in to some website, and learning how to navigate. My emails ae right there, easy to see with multiple colunms, right click replies, and drag and drop to repsecrtive folders. Easy to navigate, and filter out spam, and clearing deleted and junk emails. I can use it accross different devices and make changes in one device while affecting other without duplication. Microsoft engineers realy put a lot of thought into this app, and it functions well. THe united state post office could learn a lot about sending and receiving snailmail from Microsoft.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-31T11:30:54-07:00"},{"id":"5898783216","userName":"rarike","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id179123877","version":"4.34.1","score":2,"title":"Sweep function is woefully limited","text":"The OLD sweep function allowed users to list sender addresses and instruct the system to keep emails from those senders for a specific number of days in the Inbox (to allow me, the user, to read and respond to them in my own time), then to move those emails automatically to a specific folder after the specified number of days I chose expire. \n\nNOW, the NEW sweep function allows the user to list sender addresses but ONLY for the purpose of DELETING those emails after a specified number of days!\n\nWhat’s the point??? I don’t want emails from important senders to be deleted! I want them to go to a specific folder I’ve set up for a particular sender or matter!!\n\nThe existing function that allows the user to immediately direct new emails from a particular sender to a designated folder is simply an invitation for users like me to miss those emails altogether!! Being a busy human, sometimes I’m on the run, and sometimes I simply forget to check a bunch of individual folders for new (and sometimes very important messages)!\n\nWHAT’S UP, OUTLOOK/MICROSOFT??? HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO REVIVE THE OLD SWEEP FUNCTION??? \n\nYou could still allow users who wish to delete emails from designated senders to do so by directing the emails from such senders to go to the Deleted folder after a certain number of days. \n\nCOME ON!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-03T12:50:37-07:00"}]
