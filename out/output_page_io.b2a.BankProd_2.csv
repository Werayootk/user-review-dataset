A friend of mine had sent me a link an invitation as you will and it had an incentive for sign up I’ll sign up and get five dollars once you receive your card and activated or something like that I can’t remember the requirements exactly but it was nothing big I want to receive my garden met all the requirements after a little while I contacted customer support and Ashely what happened at that time they informed me that the sign-up bonuses and referral program was only for their British customers even though inside the app there is a referral button at the top left-hand corner that has a gift package on it and really kind of makes you think why is that there if I’m not allowed to use it but that’s not the reason for this poor review approximately 26 days ago at this time I was stayed in a hotel that required me to give him a $50 deposit so I’d left him that deposit on my Monzo card my deposit was released by the hotel two days later I didn’t know that though so after about 15 days I contacted Monzo and ask them hey where is my money they said oh the hotel hasn’t released it so then I called the hotel and hotel says yes we released it on the 28th so then I called Monzo and they said no they haven’t released it we promise so then I called the payment processing company, shift four, myself and I got a hold of the technical support team and the payment support team both of which assured me that there is no hold on my card they sent over the proper documentation to prove that and that my money had been released two weeks prior to that… Now the first time I contacted Monzo and asked about my money being released they told me it either has to wait 30 days for it to fall off or for the hotel to release it or if you can get us a letter from the merchant or the payment processing system saying that the money was released we will go ahead and manually release it for you so I did all of that I provided him every single thing they asked for it and once I did that they said never mind we’re gonna hold your money for the full 30 days well Manzo you aren’t emergent you have no right to my money and you are withholding money from me. And I understand why because once you realize there was no hold on it and y’all have been too lazy to check it the only way you can possibly back your own stupid play is to just play it off and let it run the timer out in the 30 days you know sometimes it’s better in life just to own up to your mistakes say we’re sorry here’s your money back",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-13T20:09:00-07:00

Due to this they could only see the expired date on my photo page and could not see the passport’s extension printed on the second page as my country only does extensions. I emailed them a scan of both pages and after telling me thanks for the copy of both pages and that it would not be a problem setting up my account spent 3 weeks being with no one helping to open my account with the emailed documentation as everything is done in app. In app customer service reps could not do anything and have sort of power whatsoever in resolving anything and could not open my account as they could probably only see the one image that is able to uploaded within the app. Horrible customer service and either the app needs full functionality or a website needs to be launched to avoid future problems. Found it most annoying that when I called they reassured me that I could definitely open an account with the emailed documents they received but actually did not and I still to this day cannot open an account with my valid identity verification document.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-18T15:00:00-07:00

The app is very user-friendly, making it easy to figure out what you spent where. 

My biggest frustration is that it’s easy to for money requests to get lost in the shuffle. Either you send your request in a text (with no proof but the message that will inevitably be buried in the rest of a conversation), or in some cases the request will appear with the rest of your spending (but again, if you don’t repay the person right away, it might get buried in your other transactions). It would be great to have a separate window showing outstanding requests to/from other Monzo users. 

I also wish there was a way to easily find your total spending from a certain slice of time, as right now you can only do it by month.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-11T12:40:57-07:00
