They give you coupons 24/7 and there was even a time where I wanted to return an item, but they let me keep it, and gave me a full refund because I ordered from them a few times. The main issues that I have with SHEIN is their lingerie section. Since all lingerie is nonrefundable, SHEIN should update the app where the customers can put in their size information for lingerie. For example, I wear a size 34A in bra, my bralette size is a Large, and my underwear size is X Large. I see the reviews and people say that the bra size is too big or to go a size down. That‚Äôs ok to see when it‚Äôs for outdoor clothing because it‚Äôs refundable, but when it comes to lingerie, that‚Äôs a problem because we have to worry about it being nonrefundable and not able to wear.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-08-27T11:25:24-07:00"},{"id":"8721389142","userName":"Ashlyn‚ù§Ô∏èüòä","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id605902434","version":"8.2.1","score":5,"title":"Love it!","text":"I love SHEIN they are so cheap and adorable I litteraly got the cutest phone case for freaking 1.50$!!!

Some clothes are iffy, some are quite nice! Now for some tips: Even if the clothes have 5 star reviews, *always* READ what the reviews actually say say and look at reviews w pics so you know the quality n how they might actually look. A lot of people just put 5 star even if its bad quality. If you do this, you'll be more likely to actually get nice clothes. (TW ed?) check the measurements too (and know your measurements), sometimes theyll run a bit small or big. <3 so far ive only gotten one thing that i didnt like but it was mostly my bad (i have a small chest so that area of the shirt was way too big, make sure to keep that in mind too when buying certain shirts).

When you try to view them on the app it‚Äôs hard to find. Things get deleted and moved to separate areas. I returned part of my order but instead of showing that I placed an original order and then a return in a separate area, it removed the items from my initial purchase as if I never bought it at all. On the desktop I was actually able to see a real return history. \nAlso, this company WILL scam you out of your money. I tried getting a refund on items I shipped back and they refuse. I opened a PayPal dispute and they told me they will not refund me until I close my dispute. They also told PayPal there is no return created. This is why proper records would come in handy. \nAvoid this place like the plague.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-25T14:49:56-07:00"},{"id":"9510691909","userName":"Unipug1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1231049355","version":"8.8.6","score":5,"title":"I loooove shein","text":"At first my dad said I shouldn‚Äôt get this app because everything on shein is cheap crap but after my first couple orders I realized that even tho they weren‚Äôt the best material it didn‚Äôt matter because they fit for the occasion I needed them to. And even just looking on the app is so fun. It kinda gives you a sense of what‚Äôs trending and in style. I love just scrolling through shein and looking at tops, bottoms, phone cases, accessories ect. My first purchase was about 9 phone cases and the total was 25 dollars. They came and they worked perfectly. I thought they would be cheap and really thin but they are actually really useful (and reeeally cute). I‚Äôm so glad I got this app and I will definitely keep purchasing things from shein!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-15T08:41:58-07:00"}]
