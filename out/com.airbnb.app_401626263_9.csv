10774666560,Ynkybaby33,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id142117236,23.50,3,I liked the app waaaay better before the default was to look for a trailer.,Great if you’re looking for a yurt or a camper or something bizarre but almost impossible to find a regular place due to the preset categories for the search as there isn’t one for just a regular place to stay. Super frustrating and I have already quit searching twice for an upcoming trip and will probably just bite the bullet and book a hotel.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-02T05:34:04-07:00

10763834805,Lilstoobin,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id218941455,23.50,5,Airbnb Host,I wanted to say I have been hosting 7 years. Airbnb has strict rules for hosts. I don’t agree with the review system so much but if people are honest with their reviews and list actual issues then it give the next person an honest view of what to expect. I get good renters and I respond quickly to any questions. Other vacation rental management places take 35% and they don’t care like the owner does. I think the app is easy to use except the notes tab being changed.  Don’t let someone’s bad experience scare you off. Most are great!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T11:09:08-07:00
