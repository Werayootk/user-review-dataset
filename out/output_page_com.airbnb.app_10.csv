I also love being a Airbnb host. But I truly fell in love with Airbnb as a company when I saw how they are supporting families in Ukraine. Airbnb has waived 100% of their fees on bookings in Ukrainian cities so that all the money goes directly to the house and their families. You can provide direct support to hosts by booking a stay in Ukraine while the county is under siege from Russia. Don‚Äôt go, but book a stay. It‚Äôs an easy way to provide direct support to a family during this horrific war. Airbnb is also providing safe refuge for 100,000 Ukrainian‚Äôs they flee from the wreckage of their homes.

If anyone using the INSTANT booking option then please be careful. Airbnb not always verified the customer. They let a person without proper identification approved through instant book. And when I want to decline the customer they will decrease my Hosting Commitment Rate. 
The visitor stole every items that could be carried. And created big mess. My house is brand new, items in the house is new. 
When incidents happen, we contact AirBnB.
The customer service told us to use Request Money option from the visitor . After 3 days if then they will be involved. We did let them know that we have the next visitor check in within that day. So we have to rush out buy stuff and also clean up the room. 
After 3 days we request Airbnb involved. They have a girl call Emily email us. No matter how many time we ask she never tell her full name. We can‚Äôt call, they have us talk through email only. 
They make us have the police report. Old receipts only all the stolen items.

After panicking I find out AirBnb cancelled my trip for failed payment. I paid with apple pay initially and have the same credit card with apple pay set up on my phone.

Terrible policy and customer service. My friends sadly have similar stories of trips ruined from this company and fighting for a deserved refund.

When in fact, we were out of the house most of the day and were being quiet for a party town. The Mexican police came, threatened to take a young girl to jail. The host then calls us, screams at us and tells us to leave. We were forced to unsafely sleep on the streets because all of the hotels were booked. 
Anyways, we tried to contact air bnb this whole time and no one got back to us. The company Air BNB actually TOOK DOWN our honest review, warning others that this house is a scam. Air BnB controls the reviews of places, in order to continue making money. I‚Äôll be taking my money to VRBO and hotels from now on.
