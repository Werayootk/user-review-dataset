Till now when playing a new or last downloaded music track, it was automatically playing all the tracks one after another in same page or group or channel which was working as an amazing music player (thanks for that also) but I guess after the last update a nasty bug is disturbing it!!! Now its only working in a loop mode and repeatedly plays the same track unless you stop it manually or tapping the next track to be played!

Please please help ! I don't know others but for me it's catastrophe ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ and at the same time not good at all for App's reputation üòúüòàüòúüòÇüòàüòÇü•∞üòâüëçüèª

You will get suspended if you use certain left wing feeling hurting terms and many channels wont let you post comments .
If you speak against certain left wing topics you will be blocked from existence just like you tube,fb, twitter etc . 

Many sensitive individuals are flooding this app that at times it may feel that you are still in facebook or twitter or even you tube but if you can just ignore them from existence and focus on your favorite person or persons to get your news and chat with friends you will love this app .
