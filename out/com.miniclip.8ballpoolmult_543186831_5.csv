11012991305,BF owners /jms,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id693802070,55.2.1,1,8 ball pool is a rigged scam,The game is a scam and the developers of the app should have a lawsuit slapped on them . App support are corrupt and create fraud by manipulating the game not following there own rules / terms of use policies . They try to force legit fair players to buy while half the game app is loaded with the bots and exploit players / hackers they favor nevertheless they are apart of or it’s miniclip in general . The app has so much corruption it’s absolutely ridiculously sickening disgusting . God forbid you email them about the problems about the game are the hackers that use exploits which is obviously them overall manipulating the games the legit fair player gets punished and falsely accused instead which is wrong and unfair in every way . There support is loaded with corruption the start ripping people off by robbing the fair players of stuff no matter how much you buy . Being black diamond means nothing to support they rather screw over there legit buyers and players to force them to buy more to line there pockets with more money even if it means breaking the law period . Also don’t expect device developers like apple or android to investigate because they get a piece of the pie and don’t care even if the laws are being broken period . Sad part is no one cares till it happens to them and even sadder internet right now is a free for all for being completely corrupt to keep money coming in to line there pockets and there bank accounts period . At this point in time lawsuits need to become more and more to teach the company’s that’s the corruption needs to stop so till there are more lawsuits and in till the public wakes up opens there eyes on how things really are I guess horrible people and company’s lije miniclip keep getting rich by breaking any rules and laws they please … ps people need to wake up open there eyes ban together and start screwing the new age thieves that rule the internet like this game and miniclip just a small start to something bigger that needs to be done period ……,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-05T18:25:55-07:00
