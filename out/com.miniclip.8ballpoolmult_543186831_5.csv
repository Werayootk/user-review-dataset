I have played long enough to where I have spent money on one of their luring deals, but trust me when I say to stay away. Not only bc it's not worth the money but bc it seems like there is a convenient glitch after I made my purchase. (Game froze long enough to lose game)This seems to be the same case with other individuals too. I emailed them and they said they would look into it and return my money. They never replied back or returned my money. Enjoy the free coins they give you and never become so competitive that you buy coins out of despair. It's what they rely on to make their money. I made that mistake only once. The game is obviously rigged. They use bots that obviously cannot lose. Line up straight with the pocket and it misses. They do not match individuals up within their ranking.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-29T14:17:03-07:00

I love the sound design and the controls are usually very smooth. The issue lies in the fact that it’s blatantly obvious the creators have no concern for actual competitiveness. They’re more concerned with trying to drain you of every last dollar they can, while simultaneously providing a service not worthy of a dime. As I continue playing, I increasingly realize how little the game cares about you and your effort. There’s a horrific timer glitch that ends your turn sometimes before the timer is even half complete. There’s also a rampant connection glitch that has made an appearance in at least 98% of the matches I’ve played, and it works very well with the timer glitch to ruin games. In the last game I played, I made one of the best final 8-ball shots I had ever done. I felt really accomplished and proud! I even did it with more than half my timer left. The game, however, decided to completely reverse my shot and give the cue ball back to my opponent. How does that even work? Fun game, but absolutely attrocious how they treat their players. Don’t give them a dime.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-06T08:32:58-07:00

On top of that, the higher skilled person breaks sinking at least a ball or two and then runs the table.  If you break, rarely does a ball fall or if one does then so does the cue ball which conveniently gives opponent ball in hand..then guess what happens?  Of course they run the table or fail 1 ball short only to allow you a half assed shot possible.  Now, when the opponent is always breaking and then running the table time after time after time and MILLIONS of coins later it becomes VERY CLEAR AS WELL.

Your algorithms for this game are completely unfair and DESTROY the integrity of your game. And here’s the problem, you do a TERRIBLE job at hiding it. Here are a few examples. 

1. Wheel Spin is a complete joke! Either make it fair or lose it from the game. Stop wasting people’s time (also takes forever). I stopped playing it for good when I had over 120 spins to use and out of the 120 I got over 500 maybe once or twice. 

2. I have no idea what your problem is with keeping this game fair but for the love of everything fix your algorithm for who breaks! I’m so sick of playing well and I won’t break for 4 or 5 games in a row followed up with my opponents break and run. When you’re playing in tournaments or for big coins it completely stops me from playing the game!

3. I have played against several bots on this game and it is painfully obvious. Playing on tables you must call all shots, and they make every shot, every time, in the pocket they called. But here is the kicker (pun intended), is they could call a pocket with a straight in shot and shoot it at a weird angle, it hits 3-5 different balls and 2 or 3 rails and drains it every time. Now some may chalk that up as luck. But not when its EVERY SHOT OF THE GAME!!! 

Fix your game! It’s not right and you know it. You manipulate the game to where everyone who plays it stays hooked just enough to come back.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-23T07:23:32-07:00

But there is one big issue here—it allows people with slow/intermittent internet connections to play, and makes you WAIT for their system to respond before you can play. It doesn’t count the lost time against them, it doesn’t notify you that they’ve reconnected and it’s now your turn (with the clock running against you), nothing. Eventually, it will time out someone whose system delay is too long—but that amount of time is WAY too long. Especially in a tournament, where one player’s delays slows down the whole tourney for ALL participants. 

Fix this, and I can see bumping this up to five stars.  But until then, I just can’t do it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-01-02T06:06:35-07:00

And why is it I literally always play someone higher rated than me? That’s interesting because somehow that means they play someone ranked lower (me). Hmm. Magically overnight I go from winning many games in a row to consistently losing now, while using same tactics. I’d rather lose knowing my opponent was skilled which is not the case here. My opponents now are foreigners who just aimlessly strike the ball but somehow always a ball goes in. The AI is glaring.

1. Sometimes when I shoot with low time left, it will show my shot, then when all balls stop, and the game will freeze. Then it will a the opponents turn and the balls will reset to before I shot.
Sometimes it takes a bit to lineup the shot, and I use a que with extra time for that reason,(extra time) and to be jipped out of a potential win cuz of that detours me from the game.

2. You need to make it to where after 2 turns of not shooting(no movement) the other player should auto win.
I had a game where the 8ball and one of each of our balls were touching it, and there wasn’t a clean shot for either of us. So the person to shoot and break up the balls would lose. It was my opponent turn and he just sat there and did nothing, so I did the same, and it went back in forth like that for 5 rounds, before I gave up and just took a shot.
Of course I lost cuz I didn’t make my shot and he won, when I was the one who set up the balls like that to keep my opponent from make it the shot.
Like in real life you don’t get a timer, so taking shots to block the opponent is strategy, and this game diminishes any form of strategy cuz the opponent can just skip his turn and make you take the hard shot.

However there are a few things that would make this game perfect. If they could add jump shots and masse shots, allowing the player to realistically maneuver around the balls as desired. Although in real pool some shots require you to hit on top of the ball making it real difficult to the player and the cue ball will act different. Such as when you are against the railing you would have only a limited space where you can hit the cue ball. For example when you aim towards another rail it would be impossible to put low English. But not impossible to perform a masse shot(hitting the cue ball on top or Ariel view)and Also when the win streak challenges are up, it used to be the final reward was for 250k coins. Now it’s barley 70k along with the other rewards being really low.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-15T18:31:30-07:00

There need to be some form of report play or other patches in some game mechanics. Ex) no shot clock in 9 ball, players will wait out their turn till the last moment and take the last and winning shot if you happen to miss by then.

I don’t mind losing but when you lose 16 or more games in row or more cause the game chooses better opponents gets old and frustrating. The other thing is when you click on a game to enter it should ask if you are or sure or not. I had over 1 million coins and dropped my phone and tried to catch it and clicked on a game whilst trying to catching it and entered a match I didn’t want to. This is one of the times my opponent was over 100 and I lost. Everything. Brought me down to a little over 40k. And lastly the daily spin. I always hit 250 or less. Every. Single. Time.

I am level 15. It’s impossible to win if you make a single mistake, because their cues are way better. Also those players play in the same tournaments where the stakes are low, just so they can get rings and wins. GAME MUST LIMIT THIS. They should make them play against similar levels.

Next is the time limits the player Shooting as some many seconds between shots but the person not shooting as to be at the table between shots to Recognize the shot and you can not shot again until they are there. This has taken close to a minute at times and not time comes off them for doing this. So if you’re better then them they can keep leaving the table to aggravate you and not get penalized for it.

Another huge problem is, even though I have enough coins to play in bigger levels, I like to play in Tokyo, which only bets 2,500 coins. And since I HAD around 5k coins, they would always bring me back to the 500,000 levels when I click on the “play online”.

For the pool pass, more challenging pool games give you a certain amount but they don’t even give you a lot. Plus the event costs money to play which is really hard to get. But if you lose, and you don’t have enough money then you basically just lost unless you get more money. I feel like new players should get a chance to win something.

It really is a great game if you like pool. HOWEVER, the reason a gave one star is a GLARING FLAW. The flaw has to do with the mechanics of a game where you play against another real person. This game for some reason requires both players to be connected to the game at all times even though only one person can actually play at a time (turn based). When I’m running the table or about to win by potting the 8 or 9 ball why does my opponent have to be connected? Why can’t I just play even though my opponent has left the match? When my opponent leaves I can’t play, and I have to wait 10 to 15 seconds for the game to try to connect them. I’ve noticed a LOT of players leave, when they know they are about to lose. Why should I be inconvenienced for winning? Developers, change this aspect of the game and I’ll give 5 stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-29T17:33:13-07:00
5635420824,00Havoc00,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id48939369,4.7.7,5,They are a rip off,I have played this game for years.... for some reason the “lucky” spins are geared to give you the lowest prizes... what would it hurt if they gave us a few more credits. I’ve spent money to play this game but still everyday it the spins only give the minimum prize. If that is fixed the whole thing is fixed to make you pay. It could be great but it is cheap and doesn’t want to help anyone out for better games. My daily lucky spins have given me 150 credits per day.... the wheel has several other prizes and points but it rarely ever pays off... statistically it is impossible to spin the same thing repeatedly but it always gives me the lowest prize. I don’t trust them they should fix this. Or just get rid of it I’d rather just be denied the extra points then lied to. F you 8 ball,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-08T21:17:52-07:00

I downloaded it about 5 years ago, been playing every since on and off. I can’t give the developer any advice on what to make better because it is already great, the only thing I could think of is to get real creative and add different game modes, for multiplayer and for playing alone, what I mean is to add different challenge modes to make it more interesting! Maybe add different levels like have the balls set on the table and have to shoot them a certain way with so many shots! The game is already amazing as it could be but if you added challenge modes it would do nothing but make it freaking great!!!! Be cool if you guys took my advice and I seen some different modes in a couple weeks!! (By the way I have never EVER left a review for any games so this should tell you something!!!!!!!)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-11T16:14:51-07:00

For one, the constant barrage of requests to buy worthless stuff is relentless. The endless boxes that “enhance” the cues never seem to improve any of the cues in any appreciable way. Add to that the anything but the basic cue costs you coins and the fact that all you really need is the basic cue, makes adding cues a total joke. Then add the multiplayer where a player who only played around 140 games with 100 balls potted has 2.3 billion in earnings.... what a joke. The aiming is frustrating and lacks a fine movement control. The balls also seem weightless as they fly around the table. Breaking is strange as one break spreads the balls around the table and doing the same motion the next time results in very little motion. Almost random and controlled by the app, not me. Also, constantly being asked to spam my friends with junk is really annoying.

Stay away.....",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-09T11:47:51-07:00
