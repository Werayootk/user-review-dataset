Todas las reservas las hago ah√≠ por que puedo reservar y pagar luego y puedo cancelar en caso de ver otro hotel en el app que me guste m√°s o que tenga mejor tarifa. Puedo ver la localizaci√≥n de los hoteles y hasta los precios en el mapa y as√≠ escoger m√°s f√°cil. Ver fotos de los hoteles que para m√≠ es muy importante ver que la tarifa sea justa por lo que voy a usar, ver atracciones cercanas a ellos, calles para ver localizaci√≥n si es cerca del aeropuerto y √°reas tur√≠sticas, restaurantes cercanos que a la hora de ir a comer no tenga que ir en autom√≥vil y rese√±as de otros que se han hospedado, etc. Algunas rese√±as importantes como que no sea segura el √°rea por que para m√≠ eso es muy importante, si hay cucarachas no me quedo por que eso denota falta de higiene, malos olores en la habitaci√≥n, etc. Me gusta que tambi√©n por el app te puedes comunicar con los hoteles (muchos hoteles cuentan con esa opci√≥n) y ver tambi√©n preguntas de personas al hotel y respuesta de ellos que a veces son las mismas preguntas que uno tiene. En fin, encuentro el app muy buena y a mi entender muy completa. Tienen much√≠simas opciones para pagar hasta con Paypal que es mi forma de pago preferida. Y es bien f√°cil de usar y bien detallada. Ofrecen descuentos y los aplican f√°cilmente, env√≠an notificaciones y tienen hasta paquetes muy econ√≥micos. ¬°Me encanta Booking.com, gracias por existir!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-30T05:31:53-07:00

11101308878,Erica/JR,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id9811167,45.2.2,5,Best hotel and unparallel hospitality,My partner and I stayed at Caldera premium villas for 6 days/5 nights. We checked-in almost midnight on the first day. It has been a long day for us due to our flight being delayed from Athens for 4hrs. We were met by a staff in the drop off location and carried our large luggages all the way down to the hotel. We weren't really happy with the room given to us simply because it's all the way down and there's alot of stairs to maneuver and my partner's knees were acting up and bothering her. We talked to Karla in the reception the following morning to see if she can transfer us in a higher room. We are even ready to downgrade to a room without a hot tub which we booked. Karla was so understanding and helped us transfer to a room with the same category. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. The location is perfect with the magnificent view of the caldera and just a walk away from all the restaurants and shops in Oia. All the hotel staff are very accomodating and friendly. Overall rating on this vacation: EXTRAORDINARY!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T23:45:10-07:00

Some reviews suggested that the staff were rude. Not the case for me. Lovely conversation and all my questions were answered. My room was ready and it was beautiful. Not sure about some of the negative reviews I had read  about the conditions of the rooms. It was clean, well stocked with toiletries, coffee, mini fridge and microwave. Extremely comfortable and quiet. I would suggest bringing your own bath towels. The towels aren‚Äôt large enough for an adult. The breakfast was good, eggs, sausage, potatoes, coffee, fruit and packaged sweet treats. The area was quiet and close to many attractions. I walked to the Fountain of Youth and the Trolley Tour & Old Jail was literally a 10-15 walk. Loved hearing the peacocks singing during the day.  Perfect location to everything!
