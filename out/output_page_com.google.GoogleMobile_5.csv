After some time passes, the app works again as usual. Any letters I had typed will rapidly enter into the form, I’ll teleport to where I scrolled, etc. While it happens life is on pause.

THANK YOU GOOGLE!

The reason I loved google on desktop and mobile was because how simple the site was. No nonsense, just a search bar. I didn’t have to look at any part of the internet I didn’t want to see.

I’ve had to stop using because it is spoiling all my favorite tv shows for me. If I open the app before I’ve seen an episode of something, it’s spoiled immediately because the app uses my interests to put relevant articles below the search bar.

Also sometimes I need a break from all the upsetting things that go on and I never know what I’m going to see when I open google. It gives me anxiety!

I’ve tried to delete these subjects and they only come back with time.

Such a silly reason to not use an app, but I can just use my browser to search, that’s what’s happened.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software,2018-02-05T19:36:47-07:00

I actually like the new UI that was implemented with the search bar, being round and a little bit larger, and I understand that it may not be for everyone, but I think the aesthetic is very pleasing. 

It was a nice surprise to align with iOS16 + dynamic island vibes. 

I will, however, express that I do not like there is no option to remove some of the features directly below the search bar. some of those features are not useful to everyone and it would be ideal if we could pick and choose which ones we would like to have under the search bar if this is going to be a permanent implementation.

Also, pasting is a pain too.  Now I have to hold my finger there for several seconds after a double tap in order to paste.  Which it no longer remembers the address when I leave.

Additionally, the “people also viewed” suggestion that shows up at the bottom of my screen is horrible. It takes up so much reading space and essentially acts as an extension of the ads already on my screen. The bouncing it causes on my screen provides a horrible user experience.

I know in your terms of services you are not liable to the content, but who knows, this content can snap a child’s brain
Remove those uncovered photos permanently! 
And also, remove the word to because someone small can find and see these!

YOU guys should make a SEPARATE APP called: GOOGLE FOR KIDS, which only shows content that is age- appropriate. Now kids can’t see these photos anymore with google kids! 
The content for kids includes educational/school websites, prayers, everything but curse words-inappropriate content, and private photos!
