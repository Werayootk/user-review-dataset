Even after system rebooting and deleting Facebook and reinstalling and working w/Apple this problem continues, as a matter of fact this post has taken me 3 times in order to complete my typing - please advise!  I’ve even written Facebook but have not gotten a response. 😡 Oh and yes it happens on my iPad Pro, so it has to be Facebook after the new iOS update to 11.4.\n\nThis was my first post - I also sent a note to Facebook around June 22, no response—\n\nSince updating to iOS 11.4, whenever I’m on Facebook with my iPhone8+ (well most the time), when commenting, reading or watching videos, it automatically goes back to Homepage — I lose comment, have to retype, and, of course, lose place in the article I’m reading or video I’m watching!!  I’ve called Apple and they couldn’t help but said to delete fb app and reinstall; I did but still have the problem — Anyone else??  Please let me know and what you did to solve the problem, thanks","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-07-04T15:10:45-07:00"},{"id":"10095056103","userName":"Ghist Security Breach","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id519761809","version":"421.0","score":1,"title":"Facebook has no clue","text":"Facebook keeps reviewing my report a problem and many of my friends attempt to report that my account has been hacked and is continuing be hacked while Facebook continues to assure me everything is ok I’m not hacked. Why? Because they are investigating a new account I created. Why did I creat a new account? Because the hacker was able to delete the sign in email and phone number to an email and number of their choice. So I created a new account using my email which if the hacker never deleted it would have triggered the creation of the new account using my email to notify me that the email already was associated with an account. But because the hacker deleted the email I was able to creat a second account using the same email and number So every time and will always be in the future fb will investigate and will conclude that my account is ok and is not hacked because they are reffereing to the 2nd new account not aware that my original account is not accessible unless they use the hackers credentials used after the hacker deleted my credentials CAN ANYONE HELP ME","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-02T00:45:07-07:00"},{"id":"9871553528","userName":"kaylaleigh12345","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1151032746","version":"412.0","score":1,"title":"Facebook? More like commie-book","text":"Wow where do I begin? Facebook sells your info to third parties. Facebook censors doctors, politicians, teachers, everyday citizens. Facebook have fake fact checkers that lie about everything. The censorship is so unreal. Facebook says child pornography does not go against their community standards but non-violent conservative groups do. Facebook lies about the number of views, downplays popularity in a video or take it down if they don’t like it (or if it upsets one of their elite powerful friends). Facebook covers up high crimes and CONSTANTLY pushes propaganda. Facebook hides movements like #saveourchildren. Advertisements, advertisements, advertisements. Constantly (every 4 post) and not only that, your stolen info from your phone that tracks everything you do, and sells that info to advertisers. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT. Facebook is a tool to brainwash. They made it highly addicting on purpose to constantly push their propaganda and nefarious agenda. Facebook use to bring people together. Now we are down each other’s throats with no shame or remorse. Nobody should have this much power without repercussions.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-28T14:45:45-07:00"},{"id":"9763339766","userName":"purplerain02824","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id433334611","version":"407.1","score":1,"title":"The worst","text":"Facebook isn’t what it used to be. It was a completely different site back then.  Now it’s just a feed full of dumb ads, politics, and posts form sponsors and news outlets, and tons of other stuff that you never asked for. Then deciding to add a filter for comments, but doesn’t use “all comments” as the default. Makes no sense. Allows extremely hateful and/or inappropriate content (even involving minors), but will censor swear words and put people on “Facebook jail” for something as small as banter. And don’t get me started on all of the bugs and problems in the app specifically. What bugs are you fixing in every update? The app itself just doesn’t work right most of the time and is extremely annoying and almost difficult to use. And market place is such an easy way to get scammed. Whether you’re buying or selling. It’s sad that Facebook, which used to be a pioneer in social media, now is the site that’s dated, doesn’t work, and is associated with old people and racism. There was a lot of potential, but I don’t think they could ever repair the damage they’ve done.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-28T22:31:51-07:00"},{"id":"9421057471","userName":"Sophiasmiles😝","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id486313277","version":"396.0","score":1,"title":"Unsafe and NO Respect for Users!","text":"I created a Facebook account over five years ago.  I had the account for years no issues.   Facebook, unfortunately has spam accounts on the platform  and doesn’t assist the victims of those accounts.  I clicked a faulty link by a spam account by mistake. And that link quickly allowed scammers to gain access to my account, within a minute they friended a person I don’t know and rapidly posted lewd images to my account.  Facebook blocked them and suspended my account.  I quickly got on and changed my password and tried to delete the posts but it was too late.  I submitted an appeal and Facebook permanently suspended my account with my business pages and Instagram.  I never got to speak to an actual person!  This is absolutely ridiculous! I did nothing wrong, I was hacked and now I lost my social media.  I tried creating a new account but that one was also banned for breaking community guidelines by having more than one account.  I’m at a loss Facebook.  Not being able to use the platform has seriously disadvantaged me as a business owner.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-21T14:14:03-07:00"},{"id":"8715388034","userName":"mdsn2","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1034807865","version":"368.0","score":1,"title":"My account is going to be completely disabled in 30 days.","text":"I have never experienced an automated company that does not serve their people. There are no options to contact a representative at facebook in regard to technical problems about your account and it is always a hassle to find an UP TO DATE email. \nI have had a huge issue with facebook regarding my account being disabled. I had somebody post inappropriate photos and dialogue on my account without my consent, and facebook’s algorithm took it as me, myself, posting lewd content onto my account.\nThere is no other way to resolve this matter besides letting facebook “look at my account once again”. I am very dissatisfied with facebook over an incident out of my control. It is always a “resolve on your own” when there is no option to bring my account back! I have tried multiple times to contact different support groups at facebook and none has reached out to me nor emailed back. \nI do not mean to sound so stern, however, it is complicated to find some assistance on issues that are out of my control on facebook.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-27T21:52:33-07:00"},{"id":"8553622997","userName":"YEBOITITO","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id860188142","version":"361.0","score":1,"title":"Horrible","text":"You want to make a new account??
