Offering us places to stay that are double what we expected per night. Spent the rest of the night calling hotels and motels.

11010437592,Johnny V 333,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id164591049,44.6,1,Rip off,"First, even though I pay the extra fee ($40) up front to have a “flexible ticket” plan, twice (the only 2 times I tried) I have had to pay an additional fee ($75) again when I changed my flight. When I go online and check the prices, it’s different from what they quote on the phone. I believe that’s part of why they don’t allow you to change it online. You HAVE to call in to change flights. 

Second, they can’t take the payment over the phone while you are talking to them. They send you an email with a link (that looks like a spam page) to make the payment, then they will send the confirmation later. 

Third, after making changes to your flight, the app doesn’t update and so you only have the email confirmation with the changes. Seems pretty cheap that they can’t update the changes on the app too. Doesn’t provide confidence. I prefer the other travel apps now instead of this one. 

Fourth, I’ve booked flights and hotel stays, yet, I have no rewards from this app. But if I book more I can reach “Genius Level 2” rewards. Doesn’t seem worthwhile when other apps are providing better benefits.

 I see 5 star reviews on here from people saying how they loved the hotel stay, but that’s not related to this app functionality. The hotel rating is different from this app rating. The hotel may be 5 stars, but this app is 0 stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-05T03:45:05-07:00

Horrendous customer service - and they claim to be in the customer service industry, you should be ashamed of yourself leaving a ‘valued’ customer in this sort of situation claiming that you’re BOOKING hotel rooms and doing the exact opposite. What ever happened to people treating people like people and not just reading a script and technicalities and policies with which make literal nonsense if you simply had just taken the time to listen to the customer and their situation and done their job and resolved this with no problem. But instead they chose the money road and well guess what you just lost a very valued top tier gold member in the process. What a disgrace. How any company can treat a hotel that they have a ‘relationship’ with for business and a so called valued customer.

The sliding scale price filter is impossible to use on phone or desktop. When you set an upper limit, and then try to adjust the lower limit, the scale zooms out drastically and resets the upper limit. For example, I tried to set the upper limit to $80 a night and then when I moved the lower limit, the upper limit changed to something like $5000 per night, and on that scale the sliders for upper and lower limit are so close together that neither finger nor mouse can select either slider. So the function is basically unusable. Just make it a text input box instead. 

Second, when you try to view the property on the map, it’s not clear where the property is because there are too many icons and none of them are labeled which also renders the map function useless.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-03T20:23:58-07:00

I loved how it showed your total to pay including all taxes and fees.
 All that went out the window with the last trip I booked through booking. I booked our flight and rental car with no problems. It was our hotel booking that went terribly wrong.
 I got a message that I could upgrade the room for a small additional fee so I did so. Then I got a message that I needed to pay an additional $1100.00 or my booking would be cancelled. I called customer service right away to get things straightened out. The customer service guy reassured me that he got it back to the price I was originally told and said to ignore what the app was saying because he had it taken care of.
 To my surprise they cancelled my booking 2 days before my trip because I didn’t pay the additional thousand dollars that they were demanding. 
I was absolutely devastated!!
