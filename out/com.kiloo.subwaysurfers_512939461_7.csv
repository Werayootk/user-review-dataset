I’ve always been one of those people who watches the ads to get free stuff, and there was a point where you were able to watch an infinite amount of them. Helps you guys, helps me, right? Well, whatever service you’re using now is running out of ads, and that’s no fun for either side of the equation.

You guys are also pretty good about this, but I wish the key spawn rate would go up after a certain point. I know that you’re meant to buy them, but I feel like when you’ve been on a run for a full 15 minutes or longer, you should get some sort of congrats.

I also feel like you should be able to get the new “special” characters and “special” boards without paying money if you have enough keys or something. The “add plus 5 to your multiplier with this character” Thursdays and nothing Wednesdays are really lame, in my opinion. Maybe you could change it so you can pay for the “add plus 5 to your multiplier with this character” characters with, say, 30 keys. That would work with the current key economy you guys have set up. Or you could set it up so Facebook-connected people can do that as a further reward.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-03T08:28:56-07:00

Are we able to get better prizes other than shoes and badges. 5.) What the heck does the badge do, it confuses me all the time. 6.) How come if we get three are to mystery boxes on the run we can only open one mystery box? And finally, 7.) please improve this game and listen to the reviews.

Problem 1 - The Missions: The missions are mostly simple, sometimes they are challenging the problem is there are some missions that are IMPOSSIBLE i.e. “Collect 3 Keys in one run” “Collect 4 Power Jumpers in one run” seems simple enough but I have only gotten maybe two keys the entire time I’ve played this game via run and it seems when you get a mission for power jumper collections or something else you get NONE. I have done 16 runs in a row and have only obtained one. Shouldn’t have to skip missions like that. Problem 2 - Glitching: when you get pretty far in a run, the game glitches. One minute you’ll be hopping trains on a board with 500,000+ points and a split second later you’ll be in a different area with the guard shaking the life out of you. So you have two options, spend precious keys to keep playing or end the run because of a glitch.

You see, this game has been out since the early to late 2000s, I’ve been playing this game since I was a kid. There have been a lot of updates to the game from when I was 6 (iPads probably didn’t exist when I was 6). 
But, what I can’t figure out is, in the App Store it says the game is free- when I clicked to get it , it said I’ll have to PAY to get it. So, why mark it as “free” when it clearly isn’t!? I’d rather watch any amount of ads than use (and probably waste) my real-life money! It’s also a little laggy but it’ll get used to you playing it, and it’ll stop. If you run into something, and it’s game-over , it’ll give you the option to either watch an ad or use one of your keys to revive. If you don’t want to revive, you have to wait.
HOW HARD IS IT TO ADD A “No thanks!” BUTTON, THAN TO GO THROUGH 10 SECONDS OF BOREDOM!!!?? I recently found out that you can just tap the screen and it goes away, but a “No thanks!” button would be helpful for all of the newbies who haven’t figured that out yet.
Anyways, I can see why this game deserves 5 stars. It’s amazing 😉

I would play it almost non-stop. I loved trying to get the highest scored I could and running away from a fat guy and a dog. I didn’t have friends as a kid, so when I went outside it was with my dad. I remember sometimes saying, “Hey, daddy? Can we play Subway Surfers?” He asked, “What’s that?” So I explained it to him. I would run around the yard while he chased me. And when I fell over or slowed down he’s tackle me, just like in the game. 

This game was recently suggested to me by the App Store, and I couldn’t help but decide to get it again. My favorite character was always Lucy, and she still is! I’m probably using her right now.

I recently came back to it for nostalgia and I'm quite upset. I had SO MANY exclusive characters and boards and guess what? It didn't save that I bought them. I thought connecting to Facebook would've saved my progress but it didn't. I had the exclusive elf tricky and everything. The only thing that stayed was my highscore. Even my maxed out multiplyer was gone and now I have to redo EVERYTHING.
Moving on from that, everything is unreasonable pricey for a game that's buggy. There would be times I HAVE to pull out a board while playing because a train would be coming from all three of the lanes. Plus it's super laggy.
It would be so much better if my purchases and progress has saved and if everything wasn't pricey.

It influenced many, many other games. It’s just so addicting swiping left, right, and up to jump. It’s just swiping back and forth but it has a deeper meaning than that. It’s avoiding obstacles while also running away from an angry policeman. It’s collecting coins to buy boards and other items. It’s a story in the size of a phone screen. It even has different characters to collect. There are so many places to surf and so many songs to choose from. It is amazing.

In my opinion I think ads are boring and annoying. But it only gives you a option if you mess up and sometimes with a reward. So I do it but not often. One of the rewards I like when I play the game is the rocket or the super mystery box. But you only have to watch one video to continue with a reward but only sometimes. I don’t highly recommend this game but is fun. If you get enough snow flakes you can unlock the reward and use it. This game is a little hard in my opinion. But I get a lot of rewards and they are good oh also an another reward is a board so if you crash you loose the board and have a second chance. Thank you for reading my review this is a fun game try this game some time thank you!😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃😛😛😛😛😙😛😙😛😛😛😛🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪😛🤪😲😲😲😲😴😲,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-19T16:00:09-07:00

It was my first game ever downloaded when I first got the iPhone 5. I pretty much stuck with it since then. I love this new world tour addition to the game. It brings new characters, boards, and even new sceneries to run in. Unfortunately my love for it is slowly dwindling because of the ad increase. I understand sometimes ads need to be in games but it seems like the ads just doubled. For example, is it necessary to get an ad pop up EVERY TIME it comes back to the title screen. Even after I go to the other menus, as soon as it gets back to the title screen another ad pop up. I don’t what changed exactly but if you can somehow decrease the ad pop ups that would be awesome.

I can say that this past week I’ve been top 3 and I’ve aimed to get to number 1 so of course I play a lot. Recently my games however have been lagging and messing me up when I get so far into the game which ticks me off because it takes me awhile to get to a certain point. Not only that but in my most recent game it asked if I wanted to keep Local or Online which it does when I pause the game. Guess what? I unpaused the game and that screen popped up which messed up the game for me. It was upsetting because I had gotten so far and I had to waste my keys. Of course it didn’t matter because my game lagged at the end and messed me up. So now I might just delete it. No point I’m playing a game that I can always guarantee won’t mess up because trust me it has many times already,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-02T21:00:32-07:00

I used to get frustrated because of the costs of the new characters, but after I bought my double coin, that frustration was gone, it cost $4.99 but it’s worth it because I can easily make more then 100k.
It gives me double coin while I’m running and when I get caught I just touch where it says “double coin” and I have the chance to double the coins I got. 
Example: I get 5k in one run, because I have my double coin, I get to double it up to 10k
When I get caught I click the “double coin button” and it will give me the chance to double it up to 20k, easy as that! 🤗

Friday subway mania should be fun like the rest daily runs and the perfect opportunity to get gold gift boxes but it isn’t I really hate it because getting a gold box in the subway is almost impossible I scored a million and no one single box so what’s the purpose of subway mania? I have eleven million coins with absolutely nothing to do with them what’s the purpose of having coins? We have to use keys more now but other than the daily three I might get one from a box or find one in the subway every blue moon.

So I have kinda mastered the subways obstacles so it is getting a little boring maybe adding a few different ones, just to make the game more challenging. And maybe adding a few skins for the subway that you could buy with coins or something. Also maybe a new power up. I’m just throwing out some ideas for your next update.

I was forced to update this game to whatever the new version is and half my progress was lost because it was too easy or I had too many coins for their new challenges. They require you to watch longer ads than normal and this is after I paid them to remove all ads to begin with which isn’t an option anymore. The game itself is fun but not worth starting over. When I went to recover my progress it only accepted the double coins option. Just lousy tech support. They also removed the chance at hitting the jackpot of coins thru the mystery box. That was fun to burn time and every so often it actually worked. Good game, but don’t expect to have saved progress after updates.

And idea I have is what if the police officer that chases the character could die, like they could get hit or something. Another idea is what if there was a swat team and instead of regular obstacles it could be swat themed or something . Also something really annoying about this game was that my score was 243,000,000 and I kept going but then the game crashed and I had to start over!!!!!! It took me so much time!!!! I also think that the new characters that fit the theme are wayyy to high. I really want Ramona but her character is 95,000 !! I only have 38,000 and I am struggling .

And to my shock, and my rewards and my new high score had completely vanished back to what it was before I started binge playing for 2 hours.
This is not the first time this has happened to me, where in game menu elements will not load and prevents further progression for the player to achieve a higher score, or to confirm their new high score onto the leaderboard.

I was so surprised to even get a response and let alone such a detailed and kind response at that! I really do feel like my opinion is valid and that the devs care about their game and players! So thank you again for making a wonderful game that isn’t based on ads and money and also for having such a great response team! Love the game keep it up!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-27T08:14:00-07:00

My five sisters and 4 brothers love it.  So one of my sisters was playing the game okay well we all share a room. And we were playing the game.  And 2 of my siblings lost at the same time.  But they got so mad!! I am the second youngest and then they are my older brother and sister who lost.  And my older brother came into my bed with me and kept playing.  I never said I wanted him to.  But he lost again and he was so mad he peed in my bed.  Then kept playing.  Then everyone thought it was a good idea.  So when everyone of them lost at least once they all came in my bed and just peed.  Then some of them came and slept with me.  And they just kept peeing.  So until that day I do not play this game.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-13T08:05:02-07:00
