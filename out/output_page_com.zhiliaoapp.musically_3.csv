When the pandemic started I really was bored and had nothing to do. Until I downloaded it, and I was having fun, it‚Äôs just brings so many memories with me. The community is literally so nice! But mind you not everyone is nice, which I wish it would stop but unfortunately can‚Äôt. If you are trying to look for an app that you can share your feelings, or even opinions, then this app is tods for you! I find so many relatable videos in my Fyp which helped me a lot when I was at my lowest. It made me realize a lot of other people are going through the same things as me, and that I‚Äôm not alone on this. TikTok can make friendships go, and come. At one point I had a friend, but I sadly moved until I got tiktok, and got in touch with her. Ever since then me and her have the best friendship, but I think that happened because whenever I sent her a relatable video our friendship grew stronger with trust. I can go on and on of howTiktoks  changed my life! If you are looking for a great app then this is your chance!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-06T05:36:33-07:00

I‚Äôve been online since the MySpace era and can say tik tok will be hard to top good job to everyone involved with this project I see big things for the future of social media, but unfortunately moderation and the attention you receive from the people behind some of the community guideline procedures play into favorites and also break community guidelines without any real probable cause to the reasons behind taking down content or restricting access to certain features. I feel that if you have regular creators you should try and have a REAL support team reach out to them and continue to help them because like I said earlier anyone can play favorites or do anything on this application I‚Äôve seen just about everything and i barely post or go live anymore now I just pay attention to algorithms and how you will allow some creators to poke fun at racism and make  jokes but ban people of other ethnic backgrounds for doing the same to themselves!

But beyond the obvious entertainment aspect of it, it gives the user a sense of community support. Feeling connected. supporting each other. Making friends. And also it gives the user tools to be able to create and design , as well as star in their own content that is seen by up to millions of people potentially. This app is also getting families a chance to be involved in something together. Especially in a time like 2020 (to current day) and quarantine happened, people moved 6 ft apart but because of TikTok we remained connected. And in the case of the family at home during quarantine, TikTok made a way for families to grow closer, engage in fun challenges and videos together. To learn more about each other, grow deeper connections and have fun together. Also, this app has helped people feeling down, alone, and possibly having self harm ideation, to find comfort in other on the platform. To find others who have felt or feel the same way. TikTok gives opportunities to those to find support or comfort or laughter in what it is they are seeking. I believe TikTok is amazing. I just began using a few weeks ago and I am amazed.

The first thing is when you are uploading a video, you can‚Äôt save videos,sounds,etc. This bugs me because there a several times I‚Äôm on the For You Page and I want to save a video or sound, but I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm uploading a video, and then I will accidentally lose the video or sound and not be able to get it back. The next thing is I only ever see people with 1.5k or more likes on my For You Page, and I would appreciate it very much if it were easier for smaller accounts to get views, because most of the time the smaller accounts work just as hard as the larger ones. The last thing is about the comments. I wish people couldn‚Äôt limit the comment section to only ONE person. I understand if it is limited where only friends can comment or if nobody could comment, but I feel like limiting the comment section to only one person could make people feel not welcome and it is a big waste of a comment section.

I have a LOT of social media, and they don‚Äôt even compare. There is so much you can do on tiktok, and it‚Äôs actually very easy to get famous compared to other social media‚Äôs, because everyone has equal opportunities. Aside from that, when tiktok says trends start here, I used to just roll my eyes, but now I literally see that around 80% of the trends I see are based on tiktok. Anything can go viral there in less than an hour. About age limits, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app for anyone under 12, because it does have cursing, and content that is not appropriate for younger audiences, however, if it is a parent managed account, parents are able to control what their child watches, what their child posts, they can make the account private, so that only friends can see their posts, and they can even block curse words.

Now with most other platforms there is more choice in what you watch and consume but on TikTok there‚Äôs no filter, you watch what it points in front of you. And the vast majority of the creators, or should I say people who have posted some on TikTok, have no intentions of creating a actual good video. They are there to post something and get views. More then less the videos on TikTok are just to waist your time and try to pander to their audience and not make a good or worthwhile video. With that being said this goes nothing against the TikTok platform, I think TikTok was a great idea yet the publicity of it made it a place for people to search for stardom in their own way, since the bases of the TikTok platform can promote this single video that is bad quality with no reason to exist to million of views and likes. Now also TikTok is extremely addicting to a point where it is unhealthy. It‚Äôs strategy is for you when you are bored to open up and watch 1 or 2 videos but then you go down a long route of watching hundreds of videos and you spend hours of your life. My advice. Don‚Äôt get it, and watch a different platform.

Second of all, it takes up your battery very quickly. Third of all, it is very distracting and not so good to be on all day. Fourth of all, it is not included on the App Store for MacBooks which is frustrating because I need it considering my phone might break and I like to post daily or once every two days. Fifth of all there‚Äôs quite a bit of inappropriate content around the app, and Finally, there‚Äôs a ton of negativity circulating on the app. Which is shocking considering we are all isolated during a worldwide pandemic when we all need a lot of love and support. One thing I do like though is the other side of the people who stand up against the horrendous hate and negativity, and trust me I‚Äôve seen horrendous things.

When I first downloaded this app I was 15!!! At first it was called musically ! I had at least 400 followers. And then TikTok was made! And I started watching people‚Äôs videos and I started making some of my own! I started to gain a lot of followers and I just loved doing TikToks it made me happy! I started to gain more when I got pregnant and having so many people follow my journey.... it was amazing to have so many people watch my belly grow and seeing my baby grow. It‚Äôs really touching ! I would love if this app stayed because we need it and we love having all this fun. I love all the TikTokers and it‚Äôs fun seeing them all make you cool dances for us to do. So I‚Äôm hoping this app stays because there‚Äôs a lot of us that want this app to stay for ever.... there‚Äôs just a bunch of memories on this app. We can‚Äôt take it away from them. And I would be so sad if all my videos and all our hard work went to waste! I have too many h videos of me and my belly growing and just watching all my viedos. And looking back. And see where I got here. So please don‚Äôt take away this app. We love it too much(:,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-04T18:00:27-07:00

I do have to say that it takes forever for tiktok to ban certain tiktoks spreading stuff such as misinformation, toxicity, being inappropriate etc. while a lot of the time, they spend their time banning accounts that have done little to nothing at all, and I find that really sad. 

the second bit genuinely has nothing to do with tiktok itself, but more of its creators and people in tiktok. I‚Äôve happen to notice that people have really changed through tiktok, mostly negatively. mental health issues have been a big thing on tiktok and many teens have been bullied through social media, specifically tiktok. I find tiktok to be such a toxic place that I just can‚Äôt bring myself to be on it. the people on this app need major help because a lot of them are basically just confined to their beds and do nothing but scroll through tiktoks and hating on creators for absolutely no reason. 

I love the app and all, the concept of it is nice, but I extremely dislike the people who make tiktok the way it is today (toxic).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-28T18:56:22-07:00

It can get discouraging when you put out regular content and your views are only 1% of your following. The math isn‚Äôt mathing. Regardless, I‚Äôve never connected to an app the way I‚Äôve connected to TikTok. My only complaint at this point is that certain stickers (GIFS) I use all the time are no longer available. I‚Äôm not sure if they took them down or as my account has grown, my access to certain tools has changed but it is very unfortunate because I was trying to keep a theme on my page and I‚Äôve had to change it three times now because the stickers are gone. And they were basic stickers, just circles so doesn‚Äôt make sense. Even with those minor issues, it‚Äôs still a 5 star app for me! It‚Äôs just the perfect app for my personality.

It has help me grow in all kinds of different ways and is kind of addicting in a good way. However, I feel like there is more that TikTok could do to improve the app. For example, you should be able to see who duets a video. I feel like it would be easier if we want to see other people‚Äôs reactions and want to share that as well. I also feel like we should be able to have a story that is up for 24 hours so we don‚Äôt have to make videos about something we want to share that is really not that important. In addition to that, we should be able to repost videos on our story as well. I saw a really REALLY good danganronpa edit and it was SUPER underrated but I couldn‚Äôt share it with anyone because when I duetted it, it only got 2 views in a day. Also, I think we should be able to go live (like a FaceTime on live) with other people. It would be super fun! We used to have a feature where we could pin comments, but we can‚Äôt do that anymore? Which is kind of disappointing, but if you can do that again, it would be great! We should also be able to pin videos incase someone is new to an account and people want to introduce themselves.

It‚Äôs scary for younger kids, or any one really but mainly for the kids. TikTok though has done ways to help prevent these things by making their guidelines more stricter and undergoing huge movements like the profile picture incident. Which is good of them. Tiktok is quick to react, let‚Äôs make this app safe! They are being more safer! This app should be kid friendly as well or friendly to anyone really! This new upcoming generation could be at risk if a huge used platform is letting these things out there. Yes I know it‚Äôs a worldwide use and not every little thing would be fix!

Tik tok is good for like making small videos or like just doing it for fun even though they recently added the 3 minute feature, so we can do longer videos like story times and stuff. But some of the cons is that the app can be very toxic sometimes for example if you see a video where somebody had a disorder or is different for other it‚Äôs like you already know what the comments are going to be about and they are bullying the person and being really rude. that app used to be fun but now it‚Äôs like more of a toxic stage and there‚Äôs now a lot of gender wars and people making fun of each other and it‚Äôs not really that type of fun app you like to get on to escape reality anymore. And I really think the members need to some joe update that and figure something out because honestly a lot of people are not wanting to go in the app and delete it because 
now you can easily get a bunch of hate for just making one simple dance video and everybody picks and chooses the smallest things about your video out and picks on you about it.

It‚Äôs stupid. Also, the outcasts in society dictate who stays and who goes on this app. People get banned for a having opinions or beliefs contrary to what‚Äôs popular. Also, the community guidelines are a joke because of seen one celebrity post nothing but dildos as his content on an app for people 12+ and I reported his videos and they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt break community guidelines‚Äù. How is the environment supposed to be safe for everyone if this app allows soft-core porn while limiting content creators who‚Äôve done nothing wrong. It makes 0 sense. That needs to be remedied.

COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO BE TAGGED IN IT‚Äù or something like ‚Äú OMG GUYS I JUST SAW THIS GIRL DO _______ TO HER _____THE LINK IS IN MY BIO‚Äù  and yes they do actually tag you or have the link in there bio and the one that they have the link in there bio usually leads to something bad on Twitter.

I think it has a ton of potential and is a great way to build community. That said, I have seen a decline in the short two years I‚Äôve been a user and I will list them (some of them are annoyances and some are serious problems) and then explain: ads, poor pay for creators, content suppression and censorship, increasing number of violent and hateful comments and videos. The number of advertisements has increased dramatically; why can‚Äôt we ever get a break from being sold to? I feel like I‚Äôm in that episode of Black Mirror where you can‚Äôt turn away from the ads. Marginalized communities are having their content suppressed with certain topics they address being shown to less followers than others. On the flip side, videos promoting hate against marginalized communities, violence against anyone, and other concerning topics do not seem to experience this problem. Often, reports for clear community violations are ignored by TikTok. You need to lose the ads, pay your content creators fairly, uplift your creators making a space for their community while educating those outside it, and promote the creators that are not advocating for more oppression and conflict while making it clear that those who are will not be tolerated.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-02T19:26:03-07:00

The app is 12+ but SO SO many kids are on the app. Like, LITTLE kids. You guys need to be a little more aware of who‚Äôs joining your app. I cannot number the amount of inappropriate Tiktok I‚Äôve seen. Now I‚Äôve had the app since I was 8. And sadly, it changed me a lot. I‚Äôve seen some things I didn‚Äôt need to see, learned about some things I didn‚Äôt need to know at the time. I know I‚Äôm not the only one, a lot of people say the same thing. Also, I‚Äôd like if you‚Äôd make it where people with under 1k followers can go live. I‚Äôve had an acc with 5k+ but for whatever reason Tiktok glitched and logged me out, I was never able to log back in. I was super frustrated at the time! It takes time and hard work to even gain 100 followers. Also id like it if there was NOT a text limit. I hope you consider putting a-lot of deep thought into this review pretty soon, thanks!

It‚Äôs also probably the most entertaining thing I‚Äôve ever been on. Although it does have some down falls. Like videos can be taken down for no reason, videos that clearly do have a reason to be taken down stay up. For example, I made a video doing a dance and my grandma came in and hugged me. Guess what it got taken down?! I was wearing pajamas and she was wearing a baggy shirt with joggers, so it wasn‚Äôt clothing related. Here‚Äôs where it‚Äôs weird bc that got taken down but videos showing inappropriate content gets to stay up. Another thing is that people get told to kill them selfs on a daily basis but they don‚Äôt get in trouble. People get body shamed and bullied on this app but nothing gets done about it. Randomly tiktoks get deleted for absolutely no reason. It‚Äôs like tiktok is picking and choosing. It‚Äôs not fair to the ones to follow the rules in this app and still get deleted. Also live shouldn‚Äôt be debated on how much followers you have. Tiktok is an app that everyone has grown to love but it‚Äôs not always a place for everyone bc of all the hate and picking and choosing. I love tiktok and thousands of others do too. So please take what I had to say into thought to make tiktok a place for everyone!

However everybody on this app has gotten out of hand very few people haven't. I‚Äôve seen so many people telling others to kill themselves which I find unacceptable. One of the worst things is I'm not an adult but even I notice whats going on in this app. People in fandoms have been told to die for being in that fandom. Theres little kids on this app even if they aren‚Äôt supposed to be they are and thats close to impossible to stop. Theres creators that are terrible influences and theres predictors on this app. People are being bullied, people are being terrible to each other.  We need this to stop people are joking about things that shouldn‚Äôt be messed with. Currently theres a trend that makes fun of autistic people which how is that even close to being okay? Why would someone think they can make fun of people? I know why its cause tiktok isn't being monitored, the only videos I see that get taken down aren‚Äôt even the ones that are doing harm to people.

The fact that they are so many of these accounts of tiktok yet you guys do nothing, and when you guys do it takes a good month unless a video about goes viral, but then you ban random people that haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. I have also noticed people that I follow, who posts normals things, and nothing that goes against community guidelines get ban.

As for being a creator, it is very very irritating. Tiktok constantly shadow bans the creators just because haters report the video for total nonsense. They will ban you from Live just because viewers will report you over and over so that the other viewers will go to other people to rank higher.. I bought ads on purpose just to see who they are showing my content to and my content is intended for adults over 21 and they were showing my content to children 13-17 years old and won't give me a refund for the ads or say anything about it showing to them. No wonder I get shadow banned... It is not appropriate for children so yeah it should be reported but I should not be in trouble for it. This is a them problem with their algorithm and not my fault as I am not doing anything wrong. I bought ads and targeted them.. I had 6k views, 1k new followers and 1k likes. After the ad ended, it is now crickets because I'm either shadow banned or they are trying to get me to buy more ads by not giving me viewers in it anymore. All my new videos are not showing on FYP so I'm def shadow banned. The one I did was me dancing to country music fully clothed so it shouldn't be penalized. There's women on there almost naked and they don't do anything about it. They really need to hire better ppl to handle bans or use a human instead of a computer.

The app is very enjoyable all around but one of the main directives for your expression is through reposts and favorites. They added a favorites collection board but I‚Äôd like to see something similar such as a profile collection board ( adding accounts to favorites). As in it would be wiser to only favorite an account that makes millions of edits rather then add those millions of edits individually for people to see. Simple features mean a lot to us as a consumer but maybe even a feature to change the algorithm by choice, allow us to get a fixed feed of endless similar videos or on the flip side by selecting an option of random and unfixed or focused videos to make the experience more appealing and not boring( there‚Äôs been times where my feed would just be guitarist video after video with no change of topic and simply made me turn of the tok and just read ).

There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing.

It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page.

I was in a pretty isolated period with 3 young kids and a full time job. While it felt silly at first, I was inspired to learn the dances and and make some random videos and it helped me remember my fun goofy side. It was a breath of fresh air to see people being people, weird, authentic, wild, poorly dressed and with regular homes and surroundings. The other more presentable side is great for us all too, but we get enough of that and I felt like for the first time in forever I could express a creative side that had been dormant so long. It also taught me a lot about personality types, trauma, toxic relationships and traits, and healing which I unfortunately didn‚Äôt have a good understanding of until this app. I was inspired by the brave people who share the depths of their lives and  relationships, and are so vulnerable on here. This was helpful in so many ways including getting the courage to leave a rough marriage. As I move forward I hope I can help in some way like those who have unknowingly helped me.

TikTok, you need to readjust your guidelines so that they ACTUALLY protect children on the app. There are people attacking and assaulting young children in comment sections, posts, duets, stitches, etc, and a nineteen year old in a crop top is where you draw the line.... Makes no sense. This is the UNsafest app ever based off of what I've seen take place on there, doesn't matter if there is great content. Please reconsider your priorities in these regards, this app is becoming less and less enjoyable to use and a greater platform for ACTUAL child abusers.
