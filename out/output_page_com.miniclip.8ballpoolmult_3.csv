Currently I only recognize them when I play the max 10M bet. Unless you get the break & make the 9 ball, or break & run the table, the bot wins with the most ridiculous shots you’ve ever seen. In other words, if the bot ever gets control of the cue ball, your history. I’ve had them kick 5 rails into the object ball, bank that ball 3 rails into the a 3rd, & into the 9 for the win. All very calculated, not just plowing in. SO obvious! I’ve notified c/s, but………to no avail. These bots are winning tournaments too, of course. I’ve lost at least 1B in the last few days, lost my tournament lead too, all to bots. SO frustrating. I’ve been playing mini clips pool for a couple of years now & I love it, played all night, or all day. Never had this problem till about 2 1/2 wks ago. Supposedly, they use bots when players are scarce in the category your playing. I call B/S.

The software is incredibly designed amd the game itself is very realistic. That said, it’s all flash and mirrors designed to draw you in to get you to buy chips. Must be the same company as wsop as they are both very similar. I’m ok with the options to buy chips if your luck is bad. I personally would never buy chips but that said, IF the game wasn’t rigged, and was fair, I just wouldn’t have a problem with the chip purchases. Business is what it is, they have to make money. My real issue is, that they set you up to fail, to lose your chips and immediately you are bombarded with pop up’s with one special after another to buy more chips! “ buy chips and your rank will go up!  If I sit into a game, your challenger ( that the game picks ) is almost all of the time a MUCH higher skill ranking as yourself. For example, I am at level 26. The lowest ranking I’ve had in two days is a 28, most are in the mid 30,s to the mid 70’s. So here I am fairly new at the game at level 26, and they pair me up with a level 50?60?

Now not everyone can pay, so those of us who don’t want to pay can earn or pay. Round 2 tourneys prize is 1,000,000.I won the first round tourney & I guess not enough players want to or have earned a ticket to round 2 so it wouldn’t let me play for the 1,000,000 prize. It still left me my ticket so I was going to wait until later to see if I could join in again later. I closed the app and came back within five minutes to play some regular rounds & my ticket is gone & now it’s asking me to do another buy in for $4.99 or to win the first tourney all over again.

Why is it so hard to add in a call your pockets option on every level of play???? If I wanted to play with people who just wanted to show off how hard they can hit a ball I would go to the bar. Then on tournament games it’s skip play 24 seven unless again your betting 10,000 or more coins. It’s a TOURNAMENT!!!! Slop isn’t allowed and your suppose to call pockets. Yet sloppy shots and straight up luck power shots is what I play against all the dang time. I would give it five stars if they would add in a call your pocket all the time side of the game, and make the mini Games a bit more fair.

Fast forward a couple days and suddenly I look like the worst player ever. Then I noticed my balls were rolling so much more farther than the should be and in opposite directions for which they were controlled (English) to travel. Today, I have been on an embarrassing losing streak. I noticed one player who’s cue automatically lined every shot perfectly without him adjusting it at all. I looked at his STATS and he’s a level 182, not a club member, he hasn’t won any rings yet somehow managed to win a total of 67 billion. I call bs. You can’t level up and win that much without at least acquiring a few rings. So, if you don’t feel like winning is fun and you want an app that begs for money and has promotions that hardly cover the cost to play a table that produces a good amount of winning coins, I suggest you research a better, honest app to play because this one isn’t it.

One of the most obvious ones is the location of the foot-spot (where the pool balls are racked at the beginning of each game). It is straightforward to calculate the foot-spot location one time and stay loyal to it forever, however this is not the case in this game and in every round you can see the balls are racked in a different location on the table. This can be proved easily by taking screenshots and comparing them together. Needless to say how players experience is about spending money on other parts/aspects of this game such as spin-and-win, scratch-and-win, prize boxes, etc. The game achievements, also, are not an exception and they seem to follow random unfair rules. As you spend time and money on playing this game, the last thing you expect is to be randomly demoted 4-5 levels in ranking the next time you open the app. Not matter how good you become at this game, one day you have to start from the beginning.

Like you are set to win specific amount of games per day spread out as of every 5 tournament you must lose 3 and win 2 for example and after the next 5 you will win kinda 1 only
The game developers manipulate things such as time for each turn, by reducing it with no reason suddenly to make you lose or even with ball movements and physics of the game.
Just to proof with the easy way that things are programmed and not lift to Be random and auto generated i tested something like the mini games (scratch and win) inside this game only to figure that it is programmed for each try i make and wether should i win or i must lose.
I can provide proof try to scratch it (given that you have free try) multiple times by scratching one column or two even and close the try without continue than try to play it again and scratch the same two columns you would get the same Numbers, which is on lucky game ( luck based game) such as scratch and win (which should be generated randomly) is impossible to happen!.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-02-01T15:24:10-07:00

But yet you quite frequently will be playing against players with three times the money and skill levels as you are at. The spin and win does not let you get more than the three or four bottom dollar prizes everyday. They have a once daily free game called lucky shot where you are given a chance to win prizes based on your skills at a difficult shot daily. However the amount of power you normally use to make the necessary shot is not the same power that you would play with in normal game play. Causing you to come up short or over shoot your shot. This game can be a lot of fun except for the inaccuracies of game play with the power meter and the obnoxious players that you go up against when you are at a level six playing for a $500 dollar prize and you are paired against a level 63 player with a much more advanced set of skills and pool cues. It has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out. If you have a lot of money to throw around you can be a pro overnight and have all the pro cues at your disposal, but if not you will get to a higher level and find out it’s just dumb luck that slows you to win or lose.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-15T19:01:51-07:00

The latest legendary box update is pretty unfair for new players that aren’t going to spend money on the game due to the fact that they made it even harder for people to get legendary boxes because the price was raised to 89 cash instead of 43. I disagree with this update but some what understand it & see why they did it. I also feel that you’re kinda forced to spend money on the game to get good or even decent cues but if you like grinding then there is no need too.

So for some of us who have been playing since day one, before there was a pool pas or anything you could buy this game stinks. I had nearly 200 thousands pool coins, each person I played had cues in the millions of coins and or had significantly higher levels. To top it off during a 100 k pool game the cue decided to just barley tap the ball even though I hadn’t touched the cue power stick yet, I was on the 8 ball! The 8 ball when the game decided to buy out and allow my opponent to run the table for a win. Absolutely unfair, I had 100 k pool coins taken from me at the expense of a glitch and many many more due to the lack of proper matchmaking they have when it comes to pairing you with opponents.

I will have balls next to the pocket and when I hit it, the ball flies off to the other side of the table in a very bad location yet when the opponent is in a bad location and randomly hits the ball, it flies across the table hitting the rail multiple times and then they get the ball in a pocket.

The only reason I am giving this app 4 stars instead of 5: “Free” rewards. This app overall does a pretty good job of ensuring that you don’t need to pay to play. But lately I’ve been extremely annoyed at the fact that I have a notification for free rewards that I can’t get rid of because…. It’s not actually free. You need the pool pass to claim this reward. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a minor inconvenience, but as someone that hates having lingering notifications it’s just extremely annoying every time I click it to clear it and claim it, I can’t do anything about it. Honestly, by all means advertise your pool pass, doesn’t bother me, I know this is a business by an otherwise free app. But please, respectfully, get rid of the notification advertising for a “free” reward when it’s not actually free.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-21T07:12:48-07:00

They also enable people to purchase better cues that give them near perfect to absolutely perfect shots when charged.

I know it isn’t me either. The ball has been right on the edge before and I try getting it in the pocket but for some reason it’ll bounce out sorta say. Another thing that gets on my nerves is when you make a shot and all ball stop rolling and you click on the pocket you want to shoot in the cue ball moves leaving you with no chance at making it in the pocket you had already called.

9194935555,meeker43,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id158664065,5.10.0,5,Cheats have ruined this great app! I quit.,"I’ve played the 9-ball game on this app for 5 years with basically no problems. Occasionally, a connection issue where a shot I made was erased and ended up losing. However, a few weeks ago, it has become obvious that some players or computer bots (not sure which) have hijacked this to an unfair game. You can tell because it’s always the same: there’s a pause where your opponent is not doing anything, followed by a very fast impossible shot where the cue ball or another ball hits off 3-4 banks and then just miraculously sinks the 9 ball, which has just enough speed to gently lane into an open pocket. A few times, there have been other bank shots first but then the miracle shot appears. Never saw this kind of thing in 5 years of playing and I’ve now had it happen 25 times in the last 2 weeks. So stupid. I officially quit in disgust.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-17T12:50:01-07:00
9349051876,ber819,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id529295737,5.11.0,1,Rigged,"I love this game, play it every day but starting to get really frustrated with it! How is it even fair to match up someone who’s a level 45 with someone who’s a level 145?!?! Come on, if that doesn’t show it’s rigged I don’t know what does. As soon as I decide to try and play in a more expensive game I’m immediately paired up with someone who is a pro and I don’t stand a chance, sometimes I don’t even get a chance to shoot a single shot. Definitely considering deleting this because it’s been more frustrating than fun lately…
Update: still feel the same as noted above. I did a survey that was sent to me thru my email with a promise of a prize at the end of the survey. When I clicked exit on the survey it automatically takes me to the game and tells me the gift is not available! So it was a trap to do the survey apparently! Also I don’t have Facebook so I can’t really be friends with people because I can’t send or receive gifts from them. I understand most people are on social media but they need to do something for those of us who aren’t. Definitely needs some updating on issues before I play this game again",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-01T06:44:42-07:00
7252383192,littlecrazy8172,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id889852927,5.3.1,2,Sadly disappointed,"I use to enjoy playing this game was one of my favorites. Not so much anymore when I lose connection I should still be able to go right back in and pick up where I left it use to be that way not anymore. I’ve lost numerous games because my time mysteriously runs out before returning although it only takes about ten seconds. I’ve had it to where I would have to redo the shot even before I lost connection. I never thought a game could be as rigged as this one is. I don’t know how they decide which players they are going to favor on what days but they have their way. It’s so frustration watching your shots miss when you clearly can see it was on point and being able to call exactly what the next move is going to be and not in your favor. I use to think it was a money racket although I am a premium member, I buy all the passes and feed into all the extras but that clearly isn’t it. I play this game everyday and everyday it’s the same. I’m sadly disappointed, it’s actually stressful instead of relaxing and enjoyable!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-22T14:43:46-07:00
3810821360,its-a-ghost,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id797231820,4.2.0,4,A little here a little there,I play this game and I have a decent win ratio. The problems that I have with this game is that when I line up a shot dead on with a Legendary Cue and miss. I can be running the table against someone and some how miss a shot that is dead on. I’ve played other players who are using beginners Cues with little stat enhancements and make shots that legendary cues can barely make. One of my favorite glitches that make me wanna throw my phone is the one where your about to win and the game closes to reconnect and once your reconnected all the balls that you just pocketed are on the table again. It’s frustrating when I hit a ball at max power the white ball finds a pocket somehow but when other players do the same they make another ball of theirs in without scratching. Other than those issues I’m addicted to this game and I have spent money on this game and now own several legendary cues. This app keeps telling me to update to the newest version but their isn’t an update available.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-02-24T13:54:18-07:00

Everybody knows about only getting small change on the free spin wheel. Don’t really think about that or even care honestly. Obviously there are the hacks who slam the balls around getting lucky and maybe some are bots who knows. However do not switch the position of the balls on the table as like witchcraft. I mean that pocketing an object ball with the cue ball and no other balls were even contacted slightly. Next all the balls on the table are each in different positions than before. Once pocketed the proper object ball and my designated opponent was at the table instead of myself. Sometimes this is slight enough that my designated opponent has an attempt that can be made and previously he would not have had if not for a ball changing position. Might this be for Halloween purposes then disregard the previous message.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-23T23:53:19-07:00
7050732383,POedPoolplayer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1137450994,5.2.3,1,Roved to keep you spending,"I enjoy the game to a degree, I hate the fake computer figures (the ones called guest) that run the table no mater what stick they have. I hate that you can by success and not have to earn it through time and practic. I hate when you buy a cue you have to pay to recharge it spending money on money. I hate how when your on a win streak and have one a lot of coins you get matched with a 3 figure player and of corse on the more spendthrift table that you decided to play on confidence since you one a few games in a row. I guess mostly I hate the league rule exceptions, you hit the 8 ball in on break and you loose your turn, on some games you accedently hit the 8 ball in and you loose, and other tables same scenario hit the 8 ball in accedently and you just loose your turn. And my favorite (lower tables) you can hit your ball as hard as possible and as long as one of your balls goes in you go again... how does this at all signify how the game of pool is played???? The developers need to go visit a pool hall for a bit, they are in it to keep you spending money, that is it, that’s what this app is designed to do, I suggest you find another pool app like me!!!!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-28T16:28:15-07:00
