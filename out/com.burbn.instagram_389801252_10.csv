Being limited to only a few selected folders in my private messages is about the only thing I would change. Please make any image on my device accessible to my private messages. The above is still a huge irritation but I do like the app and site overall. I also believe that a female’s nipples should be allowed to show as long as they are not part of a sexual act. An image of a person changing clothes is a great deal different than the same amount of nudity showing during lovemaking. It should be about the message being shown rather than the mechanism that is speaking that message. People can be far too personally provocative while still being fully dressed than a full nude person might be while just sitting with a cup of coffee and looking out the window at a sunrise.

The fact that you can’t schedule posts, a very basic feature, is absurd, and the fact that only business users (not personal users nor creators) can auto post with third party apps is ridiculous. It’s as if it didn’t occur to instagram that users who have accounts for pleasure or for fun would want control of when or how they post. And there’s no justification why creators can’t auto post. I had resisted instagram for a while, but had decided to create a hobby page on instagram. But I was so incredibly frustrated by trying to get third party app to schedule posts (I had to set my account to a business account, create a Facebook account, Facebook then blocked my account for no reason), that I had to drop the project altogether.

The app is so user unfriendly that I’m amazed it still has a user base. It’s clear as time passes, more and more young people will select other apps, as instagram intentionally makes its app user unfriendly.

Now, the only options are “top posts” and “recent top posts”, which show essentially the same posts. 

This makes it even harder for small artists and content creators to grow because people looking through tags will basically only see posts by big accounts that already do really well with likes, comments, etc. Yes, posts by small accounts are still there, but they will be so far down that most people will never see them. I presume this is because Instagram wants small accounts to pay for ads in order to get any reach.

Artists and other creatives have a major presence on Instagram, yet Instagram keeps making it harder for smaller creators to grow.

The other comment is absolutely correct - if I wanted to see short videos non-stop I would have used TikTok. 

I liked instagram for its photo sharing functionality without having to make a video , and it’s ability to allow longer yet easier to read post comments. TikTok does not support that - that’s why I only view it but never post on it. The new IG UI just turned this platform to another TikTok copycat. Moreover, the new design is not giving the mute button (unless I just didn’t ding it) - you have to adjust phone volume to mute the videos. Lastly, it’s not as friendly to switch between stories and posts - the immersive view only gave story buttons once in a while.

Because this happened during work hours I didn’t realize until after work that IG had sent me an email that could have helped me possibly save my account. By the time I pressed the “revert action “ option, the link had expired and the hacker had changed all of my information to theirs. I’ve been trying for a week now to proof my identity through a selfie video that IG requests from me, however, I keep getting denied! I’ve lost hope of ever recovering my account. I used to love IG, but their security system is truly disappointing. Now the hacker has successfully hacked many of my followers despite the multiple reports being made to the account and my MULTIPLE attempts to recover my account. I wish there was a better system in place. This is a total invasion of my privacy and it’s placing so many others at risk.

But i switched phones recently (iPhone 6s to iPhone XR) and I transferred my information which worked for everything except i'm not getting instagram notifications. Ive tried everything i can think of to try and get them back. Ive of course checked my notifications settings, I've deleted and reinstalled instagram, I've updated my phone, and I've even gone onto my old phone and deleted instagram from it. But nothings working I've tried to look up if anyone else has had my problem but no one else has. I looked up how to solve the issue but everything the websites said to do I've already done. so directly asking for help is my last hope. i realize that it might not be an actual instagram problem so maybe you cant even help me but i might as well try. please i would really love some advice it would be greatly appreciated.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-02-07T20:46:50-07:00
4910454499,BilCyn,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id297612613,114.0,5,Mixed messages,I have avoided instagram for a very long time and preferred facebook due to the fact that instagram was more limited . It is mainly just for pics which im not always about . However i finally decided to give it a try and discovered that i never missed out on anything . The bit that really frustrates me is that i still cannot add music to my posts . I don't know why but all i know surely is that it is further enforcing me to not like the app . The only thing that is comforting me about the app is that many others are encountering this very same issue ! Why don't we all have this function ?! Fix this instagram ! This issue has gone far overdue! And with the new updates with the following tab or whatever that i heard is being taken off is further frustrating the users . Get on this instagram or business for you might decrease . The only positive thing i can say about the app is i like the new dark mode feature . Other than that I really dont care for this app . Just when i started using it ... sad .,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-08T13:12:41-07:00

I don’t know… Instagram..honestly…I feel betrayed, I’m disgusted.. I feel hurt that you would leave me out on this update, all the other updates were really good but I was also left out on it, I didn’t mind it because I thought i would just get the next update and I knew it would just be much better, but now your leaving me out on this? I want to tell the world, my friends and let people know what I’m listening to… I love music, it really gets me going. But leaving me out on a update like this? I feel offended… are you saying I’m a fake fan? Ridiculous! But also.. please, if you could.. which you can.. JUST PLEASE add the update onto my account, I’ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling, updating and logging out then logging in but nothing seems to work! So please add the update.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-23T12:13:25-07:00
4684420660,Sarue516,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id111863695,108.0,1,Terrible Support,"Had IG for a while and used it like most people would. Random browsing for entertainment and keeping up with friends. I barely make comments on posts, and never go out of my way to message others unless I'm messaged first or unless they're friends I've known for years. I try to log in one day, but can't. I get a pop up notification saying I ""violated terms of agreement"" after having not talked to anyone for a week on the app. There's no way to appeal, no way to make a new account, no help whatsoever with my account, and no reason stated for my completely random and out of left field ban. It was great while it was accessible, but there is a serious lack of support and help with this app. In the same breath, my Facebook account was also disabled and deleted. Again, I only use that to browse and repost things that I came across that amused me or that I thought were cool. It's a shame that there's no user friendly support, and it's extremely frustrating that after years of use, I was suddenly banned without reason or warning. I'd love to get my account back, but I'm not optimistic about it since all attempts to contact them through Facebook have been completely ignored. Hopefully for other users things don't go the way they did for me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-27T23:32:31-07:00
3387737107,EmJarv_29,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id404407494,70.1,4,Love the app but one problem.,"Ok so the only thing that I hate about it is that I can’t just scroll through everything that I’ve missed and like most of it at once. If I like a bunch of things in a row it comes up with a notice thing saying “Can’t Like Post. This post can’t be liked right now. Try again in a minute or tell us if you think we made a mistake. We restrict certain content and actions to protect our community. Tell us if you think we made a mistake.” And gives me 2 options, either I can just hit ok and go on scrolling not being able to like anymore pictures for about 24 hours. Or I can hit report problem which doesn’t really do anything. It’s really annoying and I wish they’d fix that cause what if one of my friends post something that I wanna like but just can’t because apparently I can’t like a bunch of things in a row in one sitting. Also I feel like I’m the only one this is happening to cause I showed it to all my friends and they all said that was really weird and never happens to them. I even tried to update it and it didn’t fix the problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2018-11-06T07:11:13-07:00

I have been using Instagram for 3-4 years now and it’s an app I use to contact others and see content. I like a majority of the features on Instagram and help a lot with account management and basic information. Something I HIGHLY recommend though is something to do with people unfollowing you. I know ever Instagram user had at least one small trigger when they lost followers. For accounts that have are much smaller, there should be an option to see the people you follow but don’t follow you back. For example the features seeing people you least interact and people that follow you but you don’t follow back. It would be much easier to clear up my account/page. Or another option to just get a notification that someone did unfollow you. I’ve been pretty annoyed by this and having to search hundreds of users to see if they’re following me or not and this recommendation is probably speaking for A LOT. So far, Instagram is a great app and please take this into consideration of new updates :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-24T17:20:35-07:00
8986269362,Perrierlikethewater,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id33650066,248.0,2,Exhausted.,"I’ve been using Instagram since 2011, and as a creative who started a small business in 2016, it was an incredible platform genuinely based around encouraging connectivity between people and enjoyment and celebration of artists. It’s honestly just been a slow decline down a steep cliff (400+ likes on a post are now down to 20-25) only catering to those with massive corporate budgets for Sponsored Ads (which feels very bait & switch for users), and has over the last year, become a sad app with impostor syndrome that it isn’t TikTok. IGTV didn’t work. Nobody cares about Reels, and yet it’s the only content being promoted. And now, the new layout is the ultimate disappointment. Instagram clearly doesn’t care to listen to its users, despite a major decline in user interactivity, while we have been begging for them to revert back to what the platform once was, rather than an app so swallowed in algorithmic chaos that it has literally become the primary source of productivity burn-out for every creative I’ve spoken to over the last two years. I guess the only hope now we have is for someone else to create an entirely new app to give us what we really want.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-16T18:04:17-07:00
