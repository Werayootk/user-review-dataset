11053318507,lritzcracker,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id206861397,322.1.0,2,Littered with ads; no support at all,"I have reported the bottom complaint multiple times to Instagram Support center in different ways, to no avail. So posting here. Instagram is a great idea. Horribly toxic. Full of trolls and bullies whose comments never get removed. A DISGUSTING amount of ads. Every other reel is a sponsored ad. Every other influencer is pushing ad after ad in your face. Also, really really stupid that in 2024, the aspect ratio for photos cannot handle landscape and portrait in the same post. And always cuts off your photo or video. Also, the amount of times I’ve made a reel, edited etc, then it won’t upload. Then I close the app and come back and either the reel has been deleted and is not even in drafts, or it posts multiple times!!! Horrible. 

Here’s the complaint I’ve sent multiple times with no answer: 

 There have been MANY MANY comments that bully, harass, and violate many things. I have reported SO MANY. Some bully and threaten others and I report it, some to me and I report it. Everytime I go back to look at the report outcome, NOTHING is ever done. None of these truly disgusting, bullying, harmful comments are ever removed. I have reported over and over and Instagram never takes action. If you have said various policies, but they’re so loose that actual legitimate bullying and harassment are not ever removed because your policies are too loose, than what are they for? Why is everything dismissed? Also, your report section is so well hidden in the settings. It is not easy to access. I never get a notification about the resolution of my report. You need to take action and do better. I expect a quick thorough NOT DISMISSIVE reply to this complaint. I want to talk to someone who can actually help and not just get some automated response that oh, your case is closed. Instagram is FULL of bullies and truly horrible people and trolls. You need to do better. And yes, I immediately report and block those accounts. I’m doing all I can. You are not. I expect to hear very soon.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-16T21:39:19-07:00

It is especially annoying if you’re doing content creation/growing your following beyond just a personal account. 

The amount of likes/comments that it filters out of your notifications tab is ridiculous. What is the point of the red notifications pop-up telling me I have 5 new comments if when I tab over to the “comments” notification tab it’s just going to say “Nothing to see here yet!” or only show me one or two of them? 

It is routine at this point that I’ll open the app, it’ll say I’ve got new comments, the comments tab will refuse to show any of them for some reason, so if I want to actually see them I have to go video to video and sort comments by “new” until I find them all. 

Just a little baffling that a platform which encourages content creation on a large scale would have such a poor notifications setup. Who would have thought that creators would want to actually like…see their notifications? Crazy notion, I know!
