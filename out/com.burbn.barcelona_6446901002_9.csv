However, it is still missing some key features like hashtags, trending topics, search by topic and bookmarking. Hoping they get added in the future",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-29T07:37:20-07:00

There!  The first 10 words of this review are exactly like the Threads app.  Your feed will feature all kinds of worthless and unwanted posts.  Don't want to see posts from people you don't follow?  Too bad, because that's what Threads does.  Just be glad I didn't put *all* the words in this review in a random order... Threads will do it to you with no way to read posts in chronological order in your feed.

10135884573,Oscillot,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114108121,291,1,Incomplete app,I regret making the account. Its a less than half baked app. Launching an app this hyped and lacking as many features as it does is laughable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get to it‚Äù isn‚Äôt acceptable to me. It has zero personality of its own other than being a busted twitter clone. It smells of being built in about a month under a crunch deadline and shipped out to the app stores to try and meet some kind of shareholders goal with the mentality of ‚Äúmake it better at some other point‚Äù at the forefront.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-13T07:16:38-07:00
