I have hosted over 160 guests from all over the world, and all experiences have been wonderful. Not one bad experience. The places that we have stayed have been clean, friendly.... just exactly what we needed for where we were and what we’re doing. Again, as a host, I enjoy sharing my hometown with visitors and making them feel comfortable and welcome while enjoying the area. The extra money has been greatly appreciated as we live in an expensive area. Now with my husband retired, I am able to help with our expensive taxes and utilities, not to mention my health insurance which is extremely expensive since I am no longer covered by my husband’s employment. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to contribute and be creative as a host at the same time, 

I give Airbnb my highest recommendation and appreciation to Airbnb and what this wonderful company stands for and look forward to a long and rewarding relationship as a Super Host and a guest. Thank you so much, Airbnb!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2017-11-07T07:17:15-07:00

My trip is supposed to be in 2 days I’ve had this booked for a month now and they cancelled my reservation and deactivated my account and I was told I’d receive a FULL refund. As far as the customer service all they say is that they’ll slap a label on it called “urgent” and that they’ll get back to me in 24 hours...got nothing. After I made my SECOND reservation after having my account deactivated, they then accepted my payment and a few minutes later I was told they cancelled my reservation and they’d send me a full refund I called them to see what was going on and where my money was and all they said to me was that he could do nothing about this, he has to send my case to another department and to “rest assured” it’ll be taken care of In 24 hours and as for my money.. as if it can get any worse I was told that my money is “technically in limbo” and that I need to contact my bank, contacted the bank and they said they haven’t gotten anything on their end...

The trip was completely planned and all we had to do was wait. 18 hours before our flight, I was texted by the host that the stay was going to be cancelled. I noticed that the host did NOT cancel on AirBNB’s app. This led to a lot of confusion and constantly calling AirBNB throughout the entire day. I finally get a call at midnight 7 hours prior to my flight, with the app still saying the host had not cancelled yet. I was talking with an AirBNB representative and I was told quote, “A host can cancel anytime they want even if it’s a minute before your reservation.” I said if I were to fly down to Miami and stand right at the desk a minute before the reservation, they could cancel. This is an absurd situation where I would have been left in Miami with nowhere to stay. AirBNB handled this terribly, they offered me a $50 voucher as long as I spent over $500 for another place. At this point all of the stays were well past our budget due to the fact that it was less than 24 hours of our flight. That $50 voucher was a slap in the face. SO KEEP IN MIND, hosts can cancel whenever, even if it’s a minute before reservation.

If you go through these reviews, you will see hundreds of people blatantly robbed by them. 90% of the time, all will go as planned. But eventually you’ll get unlucky. I paid for a monthly stay and appliances stopped working including the fridge within a week. The host offered a cancellation and refund no problem. However, Airbnb would not refund me their already absurd service fees or even the tax money. They refused to refund me for over a month’s worth of a service that they didn’t provide. Abegail, the customer service representative, just kept copy and pasting their policy without actually understanding the situation. Ironically enough, it says directly in the policy she kept sending that malfunctioning refrigerators are covered as a “Travel Issue” in their policy. When I copied and pasted the exact policy she sent me to show it applies to my situation, she basically said “oh well you’re still not getting a refund.” Easily the most atrocious customer service I’ve ever had in my life.

But (the current version) could use some bug fixes. I use the App on my iPad Pro with the most recent iOS an when I scroll through my search results, the movement is extremely slowly, sometimes gets even stuck. Something is wrong here. Search filters are also not perfect. When I set for example my limit at $200 per night, the App shows me also accommodations above $200. Also, it would be great if the location filter would be narrower. If I search for housing in a certain town I don‘t want to see housing from near-by towns. Unfortunately, one sometimes only find out once you check the map, because the title often does not tell the location. Maybe adding a distance option would help (how far from target destination the search should be expanded). 

Additional comment: What I also dont like is that I cant remove my credit card information from my account after payment (not through the App and also not through the online account).

As if the RIDICULOUS pricing on there wasn’t enough to turn me off, as well as the monopolies of hosts buying multiple properties and increasing the housing market, I tried booking a month ahead for ten guests (which will only show available listings that the host allows that many guests) and they blocked me from booking and I was told to “try again in a few days” because their ai wants to prevent parties (I was booking for my family) and since I booked on a weekend with ten guests I was automatically flagged and banned. Yet when I reached out to the host she said it was ridiculous that they blocked me because she set her bnb to allow 16+ guest and even with events allowed, and she was upset at the fact that Airbnb is interfering with her business, so I advised her to switch her listing her home on vrbo instead and she is now doing so. It’s like Airbnb doesn’t even want your business especially with their new ban in New York now which requires owners to be present during bookings (very creepy and unsafe). So I will no longer be using Airbnb anymore and will be looking into vrbo because I have been using airbnb and they have always made things so difficult and frustrating for me and this was  my last straw.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-11T23:12:44-07:00

And when I disconnected it from the keyboard and rotated the device into portrait orientation, it put the overlay in the right place and everything looked rendered OK, but when I took the photo, it then grabbed the wrong portion of the photo. Bottom line, the photo capture got thoroughly confused with iPad in landscape orientation (which if you have a keyboard attached, is how we generally use these things). And when I first oriented the device into portrait, I happened to do upside-down portrait orientation (which iPads permit) and then the captured photo was upside down. Lol.

But when I backed out, put my iPad in portrait orientation, and tried to capture the photo again, it worked fine. The problem seems to be limited to when you enter the photo capture while the iPad is in landscape orientation.

After booking, the cancellation policy has changed to if canceled on the September 3rd 3pm. before checking in you’ll get partial refund back. When I arrived, the place looks very quiet and might not feel safe for my family, so I decided to ask the host if he/she can help me with this cancellation. As soon as I finished asking the host if he can help me with the refund, the host raised his voice at me that why did I booked it on the weekend then. He told me to just call Airbnb support if they can help me instead. So I did. And it seems like the Airbnb support cannot do anything about the refund because airbnb give all authorities to the host. For me it is not fair because I have checked the cancellation policy before I booked then it changes after I booked it. That’s like scamming people.

We then had to scramble and find a friend to stay with after we no longer had a place to stay after we reached out to the host Tracy multiple times, via Airbnb messenger and phone, and eventually had to call Airbnb guest relations. The person on the phone (listed on the Airbnb as the host) said they were not the host and I had the wrong number. This is also on the shoulders of Airbnb, because of their negligence I did not know that there were several others who had similar experiences over the last couple months. I asked the very nice non-US based call center employee for an actual management response from Airbnb within 24 hours and never received the call. Airbnb offered nothing in reparations for their role in this issue, considering they have 4 other people who endured similar experiences and yet they gave no sanctions to this terrible host, and they gave me no warning about these issues they have known about for OVER 2 MONTHS, and therefore will be hearing from our attorney shortly for their negligence.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-19T22:22:09-07:00

In 2020 we had an air bnb that when we got there it was so insanely hot and there was no working AC - and no amount of fans would fix it - that we ended up having to leave and get a $400 hotel for the night so our baby didn’t have a heat stroke. I messaged the host and support and got zero help. I called support and waited for hours several times and no one ever answered. To this day we have never gotten anything back for that or been acknowledged in any way for this. 

Recently I stayed in a place and to keep this short I left my honest review which the host didn’t like, got removed claiming it was “irrelevant”, and then proceeded to insult me over message. I’ve gone back and forth with support and they have done absolutely nothing and said they can’t do anything. They sent me the support article about irrelevant reviews which mine did not fall into.

Fast forward a few months, now it’s March and our trip starts April 17th. Our flights get canceled due to COVID-19. I log on to Airbnb to cancel our trip because we have no intent of traveling if the airlines deem it a heath risk, nor do we plan to drive 15 hours each way for a weekend trip. NOPE. Airbnb is only allowing trips between March 14 - April 14 to get a full refund due to COVID-19. 

So I call hoping a representative can assist more than the app. After waiting over an hour on hold I am informed I cannot cancel the reservation because I am not the ‘trip owner’... EVEN THOUGH ITS MY CARD ON THE RESERVATION. Whatever, I’ll just add them to the call so they don’t have to wait an hour on hold. Nope. Won’t allow it for account safety concerns.... it’s my account, they’re my friend, I’m not concerned and we’re certainly not waiting another hour on hold just to be told they can’t give a full refund.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-19T12:06:52-07:00

I’m pretty easy going though so I can roll with key drop offs being late, cleaning up a slight mess myself, etc, the problem is when there are bigger issues. In my last one a management company cancelled a reservation made over a year in advance claiming Airbnb mislisted the price, Airbnb seems to dispute that but is unwilling to do anything, other than as they say cite the company with a negative mark. Thanks Airbnb, sure we have to rebook transportation and lodging and lose money but I’m glad they have been given one de-merit. The Airbnb of old was great, affordable, we got to meet nice hosts, the new Airbnb costs as much and often more than a hotel (with cleaning fees like these you’d think they were buying sanitizer by the gallon) and whenever there is an issue they refuse to assist. I may not like the Marriot or the Hilton but at least I can speak to an operator, with these guys it’s an email that says so sorry better luck next time. These so called disrupters went from making these faster, easier, and more convenient, to being just like the old guys but you can’t even hold them accountable because you can’t speak to anyone.

I offered my next guest a discount but they chose not to stay without hot water. So they canceled. Airbnb still charged me a fee even though the customer is who canceled. I waited forever for a supervisor to call me all the while only getting emails from her stating she was out of the office and would call me the next day. Never receiving a call she finally stated in email  I could provide pictures proving the hot water heater was not working, but only if 14 days had not passed since the canceled reservation.

My last communication with the support staff included name calling, rude unprofessional style of communication and it took me three tries to finally make it clear for them what was my question about. And still I wasn’t able to receive any useful response about my issue. 
The platform itself is developed very poorly and it’s really hard to find accommodation with such a little amount of filters. A lot of things feel like scam, like new accounts get lower service fees, comparing to other platforms that give you discounts if you stay with them longer and if you book more.

PS… Only fix I’ve been able to find is you have to shut the device completely off and power back on.

If you have a terrible host, good luck because Airbnb will not do anything to protect you. According to Airbnb support, they claim to be only a ""neutral third party,"" so it's fully up to the mercy of your host if they want to refund anything to you. In other words, hosts can lie about the listing or have things broken and totally get away with it.

 I recently had an experience at an Airbnb with a broken dryer and a non responsive host. I ended up having to check out with completely wet clothes, and given Airbnb host did not respond, I also had to find a locker in the area. Traveling is already tight enough with the schedule and this whole situation costed me over half a day. The host was not sympathetic at all and Airbnb will not be on your side, so if you have any issues during your stay, good luck getting any refund or support.

I really hoped this would work because I had great experiences in the past but Airbnb has really gone downhill.

Ever time he texted he disregarded what I said. AND he tried canceling the Airbnb stay WITHOUT my permission. After telling him I was willing to come to a conclusion.

I read the policy and there is no way I infringed it. No second chance to write about a bad experience. Unilateral.

But recently, there’s been an issue with cleaning staff/owners lying about the condition of the homes after leaving. My friend and several others have noted the same issue. I recently stayed at a place with my four children and hubby. The owners wrote a scathing review of the way we left things. We went above and beyond to clean the house, do the laundry, fold the linens, clean the rooms and kitchen AND even do loads of dishes. None of those were required in the house rules. To give an extent to the crazy and outlandish remarks the owner gave, one of her complaints were that there were bottle caps everywhere on the staircase. Among this joke of a problem, she listed other things like “furniture was moved.” I moved one chair in the living room, only because we forgot what the original layout was. I wrote to Airbnb stating that we had been falsely ridiculed. They did nothing. They let her keep the absurd review up and basically told us that she didn’t violate any policies. This company has been so off for us. Not only this, but returning payments are difficult EVERYTIME and there is always something that goes wrong with our booking.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-12T21:52:43-07:00

I was promised a full place in a safe neighborhood and it was everything but that. I witnessed 10drug deals happen accros my Airbnb within 30mins of getting there. My listing said whole house and only showed some pictures of the inside of the house. When I got there, roaches out front, a car in driveway, several doors locked, a random backpack in the living room, a towel in the shower, and metal doors. This was not the full house in a safe and beautiful neighborhood that was shown on the listing. I was under the AirCover terms, and although the original customer rep told me I could leave due to the numerous complaints, the host and Airbnb got together without me and talked through ways to keep me from getting my $1,400 back. They even wanted me to pay for the hotel that they asked me to go to and had booked for me. Airbnb canceled their card on file and I was left to fight to get my money back. Oh and they said I could expense my Lyft to the hotel that they picked, then they also a couple weeks later said they could not cover it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-26T07:51:45-07:00

The final straw was when I tried  to log into my account after booking a stay only to find out that it had been deleted without my knowledge or consent. I reached out to Airbnb for an explanation and initially they did not give me one and said they would get back to me. no one got back to me. I reached out yet again and several months later was sent an email stating that my account is affiliated with someone who is banned from Airbnb. I have reached out to Airbnb several times to get more information and they have refused to be transparent. I later learned that this has happened to several people with no explanation whatsoever.I can only guess that it is discrimination. I would love for Airbnb to give me an explanation and also to refund me for the extra money I have to spend because I wasn’t able to proceed with my booking at the last minute and had to find new accommodations at the last minute. This company is extremely unprofessional and whenever I call them for assistance everyone seems like they have no idea what they are doing,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-11T11:10:24-07:00

Only after my first visit did I realize email notices intended for me were being sent to this erroneous address and that there was an app I was supposed be using. Couldn’t get app to match email address. A long call to Airbnb got a third email to work with my phone number but only correct the original address to one that is really mine but account won’t link with my telephone number. I’ve made a second booking using iPad, third address, phone, and more personal information to cause hiccups but even after deleting and reloading app on phone I cannot get the phone app to function through a full billing because it’s stuck on an email address with no password and no telephone. It thinks the telephone number is owned by somebody else and password resets go to an email but the link in them goes nowhere. The app has “poisoned” my phone to use the app. Must now carry iPad everywhere to communicate with hosts and also carry phone to use as hotspots. Will have to destroy phone when I replace it because even reloaded the app won’t let go of a historic fractional account formation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-29T13:33:03-07:00

Customer service is horrible and I will not be using this service again. I decided to leave early from my stay, because the host had me under the impression the neighbors were calling her and telling her false information about me and the two others staying. So I left the stay early due to feeling uncomfortable with the neighbors. As soon as I get home, the owner decided to change her story and tell me that “friends” of mine were the people contacting her, not her neighbors. The host decided to put that in the review about the guest (me) along with multiple paragraphs of NOTHING BUT LIES. I contacted AirBnb about this, and after about a month and a half of waiting, they finally replied and said those paragraphs of lies and exaggerations “followed the guidelines”. Meanwhile I can pull up their “guidelines” and point out everything wrong with that review and how it doesn’t follow them. For example: “Content that refers to circumstances entirely out of another’s control”, “...assumptions about a persons character or personality”. The review broke both of those EASILY, yet AirBnb finds it completely okay for a host to write nothing but lies about a guest and ruin their reputation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-03T11:01:35-07:00
5835759936,Charlotte Dyess,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id936027139,20.16,1,Never using Airbnb or their services again,"With an understanding that COVID-19 has swept the nation, I understand Airbnb’s going through an influx of cancellations. That being said, the department of defense has issued a travel ban extending through June 30th. My fiancé and I had to cancel our wedding and flights to Florida and Hawaii due to this travel bad, as we are part of the military community. The venue and airlines, were understanding and provided us full compensation due to these troubling times. 

Airbnb on the other hand refuses to acknowledge the department of defense’s travel ban, and will not give us our money back. They do not have the decency to pick up a phone and talk, it is strictly through automated messages. If we are legally unable to travel outside of a 2-hour radius of our home...how do they expect us to fly cross country or across the Pacific Ocean? Let alone be charged upwards of $6,000 for a vacation we will not be attending? I am appalled and disheartened by the way Airbnb has chosen to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. I will never use their services again, and I suggest you don’t either. The company is clearly unable to withstand a large scale disaster, and my money is more important to them than valuing customers on a basic human level. I am utterly disgusted.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-19T13:28:17-07:00

This is understandable. However, after two days and no reply, I contacted customer service and they said they could not help me and my account would be assigned to a case manager who would get back to me “shortly” to resolve my problem. Slightly irritating but still understandable. Two more days passed and I called customer service again and received the same reply, however they stated that they would get back to me within 48 hours from my original call. So now, 4 days have passed and still no reply and my case was not assigned to anyone. I waited another two days with still no response and had to find another site to book with as time was running out. NOW, OVER 3 WEEKS LATER, my vacation over with, I still have received no communication from Air B&B and my account is still locked, not even allowing me to look at the website. As, the company has grown you would thing they would expand their customer service, but apparently do not care to. Will not be using this service (as if I had a choice) in the future.

9808242583,bryishe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id191735568,23.14,1,Excessively expensive,Airbnb has really made a name for themselves as being a relatively cheap option for finding a place to stay. I have used Airbnb on a number of occasions and have found it really easy to use and quite affordable. Recently that has changed dramatically. You can easily find a place to stay that is usually under or around $100 but once you go to book your actual stay you find out that the cleaning fee is usually an additional $40-50 which is quite literally half of the actual cost of the stay itself. Once you include the service fee which is also another $30 you have turned a $100 stay into a $200 stay. They mislead you terribly and don’t show you the real price until you are on the final steps. It has not always been this way. Bring it back to the way it used to be and make the pricing actually reasonable. It’s not going to cost $50 to clean a room we stayed in for one night. This app is supposed to be a platform where people who have homes and people who need homes can connect. Not a place where the service fee is a additional 40% of the price to stay. This app has really lost its original mission of connecting people.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-10T14:39:16-07:00

Disgusting. His suggestion was to grab the linens from the washer that the people before us would wash for us and make our beds. The people before us of course did not wash the sheets, (why would they? they paid to stay there not be maids), so we had to do all of that ourselves, the bathroom was disgusting it clearly had not been cleaned properly in a long time maybe ever. The rest of the house was also dirty, run-down, smelled of rank cigarettes and overall gross.

We explained this to AirBNB and they refused to give us a refund, they gave us a very small partial refund, less than half and could care less about how we got stuck in this nasty situation with no where else to go once the whole trip was setup and booked after having this booked months in advance with the promise of “enhanced clean” or whatever they advertise.
