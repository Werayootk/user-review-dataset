Family account. I don‚Äôt understand why you didn‚Äôt make it so far. My wife is often looking for places where we‚Äôll be staying. Then send it to me over WhatsApp. After some time I look over them or maybe I forget about it and when I come to it again, some of them could be unavailable already. And we have 2 profiles, so our reviews are there and there. It‚Äôll be more convenient to have family profile with shared payment methods and reviews.
Almost all our bookings made for our family. And every time I have to type guests coming with me, it‚Äôs frustrating and easy to fix. 
Refund policies aren‚Äôt guests friendly. I understand you solved issues for the hosts to bring them to your platform, but I believe you‚Äôre big enough to turn ur face to guests now. In case I have to cancel my booking (in case of emergency and not because I changed my mind), I‚Äôll get most likely partial refund and host will get full or partial amount for the cancelled nights. At the same time the host could get new reservation for these dates and get more money without actually losses. In this case host will get 1.5-2x for rebooked nights. It‚Äôll be much more friendly for me as guest if you‚Äôll refund rebooked nights in full (and you can do this easily, you hold money, so you can manage it). It‚Äôs easy, friendly and good for hosts too. And you can promote listings with cancelled nights in your search. And may be guests would love to pay some money (to you) to get it promoted so most likely rebooked. Is it nice? I think so.

11012614578,Frumtript,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id108300971,24.09,1,You are not the customer,"Recently I‚Äôve had some issues with bookings on Airbnb.  And it‚Äôs just been a stark reminder that the guests are not airbnbs customers.  The hosts are.

I had an issue with booking a trip for some employees of mine.  I was the name on the reservation, and had tried to get it corrected to be under my employees name, because the host made it clear they would not allow my employee to stay there if they weren‚Äôt the name on the reservation.   The host was also less than willing to communicate with me while I tried to trouble shoot. I tried as many ways as possible to resolve the issue in the ways the host would ask, but for the most part the host would just insist I talk to Airbnb support when I would ask them clarifying questions about how to fix the reservation.

In talking to support, they kept ensuring me that it‚Äôs up to the host how things are handled.  I let them know the host wasn‚Äôt really working with me on the issue.  To which they pretty much responded ‚Äúwell, this is all at their discretion, so you need to work things out with them.‚Äù

This was an expensive booking, too.  And all I wanted was to ensure that my employees could use the booking.  The only option I was being given by the host was to cancel and rebook.  However, there was a no cancellation policy.  And I really didn‚Äôt want to have to pay twice, just to resolve a technicality.  After hours of the host dancing around it, I finally got the host to say they would refund me if I cancelled and rebooked it differently.  But ONLY if and after my second payment went through.  So only after I paid for it twice.  When I (very respectfully) pointed out to the host that this puts me in a position of having to TRUST that they are going to refund me nearly $1000, they simply responded with ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù.

Keep in mind, I had been told by support that we didn‚Äôt have to do it this way.  That the host could call and they could just switch the reservation to the right names. So me having to trust this host with all of my money is something that could have and should have been avoided.  Either way, I decided to call Airbnb support again before doing it the way the host had asked.  I asked them, ‚Äúif I have in writing from the host that they will refund me if I cancel and rebook, and they have told me this over the chat on your platform, are you able to help me in anyway to hold the host accountable and ensure I receive he refund?‚Äù  His answer ‚ÄúNo.  I can call the host and ask them if they want to do it, but it‚Äôs their choice entirely.‚Äù  I asked if they would be willing to call the host to help work this out since the host was not responding to me, and kept insisting that I reach out to support.  Support said they would, and that they would CALL me back.  I asked them to clarify that they would call back, not email or message me on Airbnb.  Support agreed to call me back.

Several minutes later, I got an automated message from Airbnb simply saying that they had resolved my ticket, and that they suggested I cancel and rebook, and that I work with the host to do that.  They did not mention if I would recieve a refund for doing so.  There was, however, a signature at the bottom of the email that said ‚ÄúWe will promptly pay attention and address you if you respond to this message.  I responded to the message.  I recieved an automated reply stating that the representative was out of the office, and that they would address my concern within two days.   The reservation was for the following day.

Anyways.  I cancelled and rebooked.  The host has still yet to refund me for the original booking.  And Airbnb doesn‚Äôt care, because the host is their customer.  Not me.

Will be using Expedia and booking at hotels from now on.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-05T15:52:33-07:00

Issue number one is the quality of the bed, it‚Äôs not controlled and I have slept on a mattress that felt over 10 years old on multiple occasions. And I mean a bed that saags to the point you and your significant other roll into one another. Marked as a plus location. 
The next issue, is the bath products. Never have I ever (lol) been at an airbnb with bath products that reflect the quality of the property.
