11044343482,rubapubpub,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id134512724,24.11,3,Update for new AIR BNB    March 2024,"I have been utilizing Air bnb since its inception and I will tell you that it is the hosts that define the quality of this product and not the app.  That being said, the Airbnb app is now the most convenient tool  to find alternatives to hotels in the travel biz.  I do find google search to run a close second to this app and find google infinitely easier to use- such that I find many Airbnb on google then get the details on Airbnb app.  

I still find Airbnb format, codes and operation extraordinarily ineffective in getting the whole picture.  Even many reviews reveal hidden codes as “cozy bed” meaning its rented for 2 people but its not even a queen bed -or- “rustic” surroundings meaning a junkyard is on the same block as where you are staying. 

Also, app navigation has never been that intuitive. I still find myself vetting stuck in places and starti g the app over. It is as if they never really knew what a “back button” was. 

In the end, I have had many good experiences and one or two exceptional ones, all being because the host made it so. 

March 2020 entry

The app has definitely gotten better with a few issues remaining. Receipts can be viewed but not printed, emailed, or otherwise utilized in any way!?? House rules seem to be more dodgy than ever. Sometimes they are easily found, sometimes theyare emailed after a reservation and almost all are rants of disorganized personalities 🤪 . Airbnb survives because of really cool people hosting the coolest and most diverse amenities ever offered. Airbnb serves this market with an average score of 3 stars. App now cuts off text messages and inhibits return messages even inside the app. Het twice the messages tou cannot respond to. Cool! Just keeps getting worse! This app is different but not better Has the search by map been removed or moved where I can't find it?? Why is taking longer to find more unavailable properties? Just updated again to try features and tools. App freezes... App is still clunky but better than it was but I just got recommended stays a surprising distance from my intended destination..... The app is worse than ever and the whole AIRBNB system is getting to be a frustrating mess. I have attempted to book 5 locations in the last 6 months with one success. After a major frustration I was offered over $100 instant credits and still chose not to book with AIR BNB...... This is getting unfriendlier and more ""corporate"" by the day. Earlier version .... Whoever released this needs to roll it back up! I have attempted to book stays with complete frustration and mix ups. The app has reversed it performance of user ease. Avoid this new version....",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-14T11:57:57-07:00

It is so much easier and less expensive to use AirBNB instead of hotel chains.  Occasionally I use it for business travel when I am looking for a specific area and can’t find a hotel.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T14:36:42-07:00

Text (as in 'how to get in' messages) cannot be zoomed in on. Nor can it be copied by a long press. This forces you into all sorts of cludgy work-arounds.

As noted, love the service but make the app more user friendly.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-13T05:53:45-07:00
