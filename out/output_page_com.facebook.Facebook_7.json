The problem is that AI is being triggered over what we type, though it is harmless, meanwhile memes that ARE against FB standards are being let through by this same AI system, because they are pictures and therefore not as heavily monitored. \n\nI truly wish there was a viable Facebook competitor, because they are truly awful; if I could give negative stars for the sole reason of their monitoring systems, I would. Unfortunately app review doesn’t allow that, so my negative rating is in the title. \n\nIf you haven’t yet been sucked into Facebook to keep up with your friends, do yourself a favor and don’t even start. It isn’t what it used to be, and I contemplate getting rid of it daily, but it would cut out my friends from thousands of miles away, whom I can no longer see due to moving.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-25T12:05:18-07:00"},{"id":"7450170143","userName":"EdibleFartsauce","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id476386525","version":"322.0","score":1,"title":"Not worth having on your phone","text":"I can't look at more than a handful of recent post from friends unless I increase my friend count, so I have to accept people I don't speak to, or constantly check in all day. I will do neither. Facebook was always a good idea to keep in touch with that group of close friends and family that have grown physically distant over the years. I don't want to participate in a popularity contest. And all that being said, it would be fine to keep running in the background on my phone for when I really want to tell my friends something. \nWhat's really got me bothered is the inability to stop Facebook from pushing things at me. I don't care what celebrities got the shot, I follow no famous people. So I hide the post and it tells me I'll see less of this in the future. Apparently when they say the future they mean in 10 minutes, because here we go with more covid news. I don't watch any news organizations, I don't idolize any franchise of films, I don't care about human interest stories and I don't like any of your idiot politicians.

Facebook’s algorithm controls the posts you see so you see more paid content, and 1 in every 3 posts is an ad for something. The posts you do see from people you sort of know are usually posts from your racist Trump supporting uncle, because those posts have gotten a lot of engagement (usually likes and hearts from your uncles racist friends, or because you  argued with them ONE TIME in the comments and now Facebook’s algorithm thinks you’re best buds and want to see even MORE of their racist garbage.) oh, and Facebook tracks you everywhere you go on the internet in order to collect lots of data on you so they they can know everything about you because they’re so sure you just love love love all those personalized ads the bombard you with.\nApple really needs to ban this app from the App Store until Facebook comes clean about what the app really is, and stop calling it a “social media” app. Seems like a clear violation of App Store policy to me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-27T08:28:36-07:00"},{"id":"6674020908","userName":"mcivercoble","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id581928972","version":"297.0","score":1,"title":"Inadvertent slandering and potential privacy breeches","text":"First of all they are now rearranging comments taking them out of chronological order and making serious conversations look completely bizarre and hard to follow and so in a sense slandering those engaged in the conversation. I’ve also had a couple videos censored. After reading the explanation for why they censored it there was an obviously bias perspective that did not address everything as a whole. They twisted what the video was saying with their perspective and not verbatim. Grown adults should be able to use their own discretion as to whether or not something is touching on the truth without having another stranger who obviously is going to have an opinion & bias of their own interject. I’m also not very fond of how they’ve grown so big that they’re taking it upon themselves to tap into personal conversations for marketing as well as how much they are involved in obtaining personal information other than what somebody blatantly gives them such as the “about” information the user fills out themselves.

Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I’m assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What’s worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the “view on Facebook” button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it’s doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn’t show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else.

Instead of tapping the button and it takes you to the comments to read, the video now becomes smaller and continues to play. If you try to tap the video to pause it, it just makes the video the original size and continues to play. Why would someone want a video they just watched, to keep playing as they’re trying to read the comments? Now you have to tap the “add comment” box at the bottom of the video to at least cover the video but you also have remove the “add comment” box first to get a full view of the comments. That’s not even a guarantee that the video will continue to stay paused during that time either. Sometimes you’ll scroll only a few comments down and the video will start to play again on its own.

That said, due to school and broader socialization opportunities, I finally felt the need to make an account. After finalizing my account and verifying all of the information with the many codes sent, it only took about 40 minutes for them to suspend my account. They claimed their computer software detected inauthenticity even though I allowed their app access to all of my photos, email address, contacts, and phone number. All of these same details can easily be linked to my Instagram account (which is also owned by Meta), but somehow their computer software was incapable of doing so and jumped to a radical conclusion that I wasn’t real. I sent an appeal (which involved sending them a live video of my face turning left and right… very uncomfortable), and won’t hear back for another 2 days. After hearing nothing but complaints from people in my life about FaceBook and their creepy invasiveness, this solidifies the distaste I have for this company.
