Dear LinkedIn Support,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the recent events surrounding my LinkedIn account. After being an active member for 15 years, diligently growing and developing my professional network, I was shocked to discover that my account had been permanently restricted without any explanation provided.

What adds insult to injury is the fact that all the personal information I had painstakingly collected over the course of those 15 years has seemingly been stolen by LinkedIn itself. This egregious violation of trust raises serious concerns about the security of our personal information on the platform.

As a long-time user, I believed that LinkedIn, being a prominent professional networking platform, would prioritize the privacy and security of its members' data. However, this incident has shattered that confidence. It is disheartening to see how such a breach can occur in the United States, where we expect a higher standard of data protection.

What exacerbates the situation is the lack of transparency and communication on LinkedIn's part. Without any details or explanations provided, I am left in the dark, unable to understand the reasoning behind the drastic measures taken against my account. This lack of accountability only further erodes the trust I once had in the platform.

At this point, I can only hope that the individuals responsible for this breach will be identified and brought to justice. It is essential that scammers and wrongdoers face the consequences of their actions. Moreover, I implore LinkedIn to take immediate steps to rectify this situation, not only for me but for all users affected by similar incidents.

I had always considered LinkedIn as a reliable platform for professional purposes, but my experience has left me with no choice but to warn others about the potential risks involved. It is disheartening to see a platform with such potential fail to fulfill its duty in safeguarding its users' information.

I expect a prompt and thorough investigation into this matter, along with a detailed explanation of the actions taken against my account. Additionally, I request that appropriate measures be implemented to prevent such breaches from occurring in the future and to restore faith in the security of our personal information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that LinkedIn takes this complaint seriously and works towards resolving the issue to regain the trust of its users.

Sincerely,

I.D",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-19T09:05:31-07:00
10713837318,Nik’s_Reviews,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1589647145,9.1.346,5,Good Platform form for Professionals,"I have been using LinkedIn for quite sometime.  I like using LinkedIn for all of my professional contacts, seeing what jobs are available, what trainings are being recommended and what is new with the companies that I follow and my network.  

While I am in the app and finding businesses I want to follow, it would be great if there could be cross-platform of all Meta Platform apps that when I follow a company here, I would automatically be following all of the affiliated pages for that company within all apps on the Meta Platform.  This would allow friends who are on FaceBook but not necessarily already on LinkedIn be able to see on my wall what different company’s are offering since I have ads appearing.  This might entice them to either checkout a training class or product that they might not necessarily have known about along with eliminate me from missing a cross post to the other platform.  

I notice that company’s I am following are also available in my Amazon platform.  Since Amazon is also on the Meta Platform, it would be easier for me if not only when I follow the company on LinkedIn that the follow also attaches to all other applications including Amazon on the Meta Platform.  

Thank you!

There’s no number to call for help, and if you search for one, they have a notice stating all lines pretending to be LinkedIn are a scam and they’re working to eradicate them. But… you could also just have a legitimate help-line yourself.

This app is supposed to be used for a number of professional purposes, but the sole focus for most people is finding a job. $40 a month for a service that.. at it’s core function, does what?… Helps people find a job so they can make money?

Latest update completely wiped all my relevant job recommendations. Before it showed great relevant recommendations on jobs for me. Now suddenly is completely off! Think software management jobs vs now room technician jobs. Totally off! And on top of that, constant sluggish scrolling and glitches on job posting list view.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-11T14:39:18-07:00

Even if you select the option that you don’t have access to that device and that you want a text or email it will STILL not allow you to reset your password or login. So you have to download the app again which means I, at least, will be deleting the account.
