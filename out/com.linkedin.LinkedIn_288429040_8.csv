After I complied and provided my ID, they lifted the restriction, without even strictly requiring a password change. This measure seems unrelated to actual account security, because, how it prevents attempts of unauthorized access by an intruder?

I just have a few possible bugs to report about this version of the app. I love the LinkedIn app. Great features. Quality user experience and interface. The app mirrors the desktop app very well.

Here are my concerns to report

• The LinkedIn app freezes when I go to my profile page regardless of how I try. I’ve swiped right on the screen and I’ve pressed my profile image in the top left corner to get to my profile. The app then freezes on the LinkedIn feed page.

• I’ve been invited to provide responses as an expert on a few LinkedIn led marketing articles or conversations. The articles mention receiving a “Top Voice in {Insert Industry}” badge when more than a few of these expert sourced articles are responded on. I haven’t received a badge for either of the industry categories I’ve been responding on.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-02T09:40:11-07:00
