I had high hopes for the ChatGPT app, but unfortunately, my experience has been quite underwhelming. While the concept of an AI language model is intriguing, the execution falls short in several areas.

Firstly, the app’s performance is inconsistent. Sometimes it responds promptly, but other times it lags or fails to understand my queries, leading to frustrating interactions.

Secondly, the range of topics the AI can handle is limited. It struggles with more complex or specialized subjects, making it less useful for in-depth discussions or research.

Additionally, the lack of customization options is disappointing. It would be great to have the ability to fine-tune the AI’s responses to better suit individual preferences and needs.

Lastly, there are occasional inaccuracies in the information provided. While I understand that no AI is perfect, relying on potentially incorrect information can be problematic.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app has potential, but it requires significant improvements to be truly valuable. I hope the developers take these concerns into account and work towards enhancing the app’s performance and versatility.

I am writing the answer from GPT below:

In a static case, the equilibrium equations for a 3-dimensional body are as follows:

1. Equilibrium in the x-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the x-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{11}dA + \sigma_{21}dA + \sigma_{31}dA = 0
\]

2. Equilibrium in the y-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the y-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{12}dA + \sigma_{22}dA + \sigma_{32}dA = 0
\]

3. Equilibrium in the z-direction:
\[
\sum \text{(forces in the z-direction)} = 0
\]
\[
\sigma_{13}dA + \sigma_{23}dA + \sigma_{33}dA = 0
\]

Now, let's focus on the relationship between \(\sigma_{23}\) and \(\sigma_{32}\):

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = (\sigma_{22} + \sigma_{32} + \sigma_{32}) - (\sigma_{32} + \sigma_{23} + \sigma_{33})
\]

Since \(\sigma_{22} = \sigma_{33}\) (due to the stress tensor's symmetry), we can simplify the equation:

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = 2\sigma_{32} - (\sigma_{32} + \sigma_{23} + \sigma_{32})
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
\sigma_{23} - \sigma_{32} = \sigma_{32} - \sigma_{23}
\]

This equation shows that \(\sigma_{23}\) is equal to \(-\sigma_{32}\), or equivalently, \(\sigma_{23} = -\sigma_{32\).

It appears that the original analysis is correct, and \(\sigma_{23} = -\sigma_{32}\) for a static 3-dimensional body.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-27T10:00:21-07:00

Being in a small town in NC of less than 5000 people, they were not forward thinking. Let’s just say I didn’t make it to the science fair but the kid who compared tide, all and gain did… 

My biggest suggestion is to always remember AI is only as good as the information you put into it. So make sure you aren’t using incorrect data and always double check everything.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

the iOS app (on iPad) has become my preferred method of using ChatGPT due in large part to the fact that the website version performs incredibly poorly after you’ve been using a chat for a while. the tab becomes very unresponsive, huge delays to activate the text entry field. i’ve tried safari, chrome and firefox. it’s a problem on all of them.

anyway, back to this app. generally i like it a lot and i’ve been very happy with the performance, but i have on major complaint: it really need a a way to set narrower margins on the iPad. looking at a long response where the text goes from edge to edge of my 12.9” iPad Pro’s screen is not a good experience. i deal with it by using Stage Manager and narrowing the GPT window, but i’d prefer to not need to do that. please get a designer in the room w the devs! lol.
