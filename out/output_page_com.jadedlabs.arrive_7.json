What‚Äôs not to love! \nAt first I purchased my skirts in large, but now I realize that I am one of those people ‚Äúbetween sizes. I now order medium.  The little extra piece of Velcro that comes with the skirt is very helpful.  I tend to wear the ones that I ordered in large a little lower than my waist, sort of sitting right on my hips; so i can wear a medium or large just depending upon how I want to wear it and what top I‚Äôll be wearing. Very versatile.  I love the sun scarves too, but don‚Äôt think there is one in this print.  Getting ready for a trip.
