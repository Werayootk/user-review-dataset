A third driver picked up the trip and arrived as scheduled, did a great job.

5201019229,nei77,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id483967675,3.378.10002,1,TRASH.,"Within a one months time, I‚Äôve experienced over 5 issues with uber support and their drivers. On 3 of those occasions I was not picked up by my driver at all; however, the drivers proceeded to confirm my pickup through the app and take my money without me even taking the trip. Whenever I tried to cancel the trip I was charged a cancellation fee. Whenever the driver cancelled, I was charged the full amount of the trip I did not take and one occasion I was charged even more than the original cost. Every time I have filled a complaint through the help section of Uber support, I received little to no compensation at all. Whether my trip was $10 or $30, my only compensation has been $5 in Uber cash. Which ultimately equates to absolutely nothing, considering the fact that $5 will get you nowhere, but perhaps around the corner in an uber. I have yet to be fully refunded. I have been using uber for 2 years now and I am shocked and disgusted by this new trend of just straight up, ripping customers off. I am tired of the incompetence of the drivers and the unprofessionalism of the Uber app and its help/support system. I would seriously consider trying Lyft before using this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-26T14:29:23-07:00

In my home town I always have to tell the driver where to go because the app would make the take an illegal turn. And the suggestions  for destinations are a joke. Recently I was erroneously clicked on a hotel of the same brand but 50 min out of my way instead of the hotel of the same brand to which I haven taken an Uber 50 times because it was listed first and I could not see the full name / address.  Only half. Way did I realize that I was heading in the wrong direction. The app used to be good. It is hard to understand how it has gotten so faulty and shoddy. It almost seems deliberate.

Recent improvements in the app and the search engine behind it are solid progress. My wait time has dropped and rides are showing up (versus cancelling on me repeatedly). Still, there have been a number of recent times when the fares are quite high (comparable to a taxi) and also seem to vary quite a bit. And the app itself on my mobile device are very reliable. The predictability still needs work but has also improved quite a bit. For its ease of use and constant and steady feature improvements, I give it 4-stars only because I think it can be even better in terms of predicting when rides will arrive and also when I schedule a ride, that they show up at the designated times.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2017-10-26T19:15:10-07:00
2377357023,Sassymujer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id766289457,3.291.10003,4,Pick up and drop off made easy,"I‚Äôve used Uber in Washington, DC and I am happy to see it growing. It is nice to have the options of Uber Pool or Uber regular and XL. The app is user friendly and I like that I can send my status to my friends. It is somewhat bothersome when a driver can accept my ride whenever he/she is >10 minutes away. This happens to me frequently at the airport and often they cancel because it is inconvenient for them too. So I end up waiting over 20 minutes for an Uber that may or may not cancel on me. I get that I can schedule a ride but it is nearly doubled the price. I don‚Äôt fault the driver because I think that it is a system error. Lastly, I honestly wish I could rate my co-riders majority of the time they either keep to themselves or have pleasantries but those other times when they are rude and inconsiderate...well it somehow negatively impacts the driver and it isn‚Äôt fair. Anyways I will still use Uber over Lyft but would like to see the issues addressed if feasible.

Very respectful, reserved, polite, kind and thoughtful. Even went the extra mile and carried my stuff for me. I was very impressed with the experience I had.  

Very smooth and pleasant, perfect driving and decision making. Honestly I could not have asked for a better driver and the fact that he made sure I got to my destination before it closed really helped me tremendously. 

It will be hard not to compare any future drivers to this experience and how well everything went. Even when dropping me off waited until I was inside to drive away.  Was not it a rush or irritated by the time the drive took. Overall I can say this was an experience that exceeded my expectations and left an overall feeling of satisfaction and gratitude with me. Also the response time was incomparable!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-13T21:26:34-07:00

The only reason he got out at my drop off was to close the trunk after he watched me pull my luggage out.  

As a person with chronic back pain and often travel with an elderly mother who also has trouble lifting luggage into trunk due to pain in shoulder, I think it‚Äôs important that all drivers always offer assistance with with customers‚Äô bags. It‚Äôs just the right thing to do. 

Once I even asked for help and the driver ignored me.  And that was right after I had back surgery!  The lack of human kindness is astonishing from some drivers. They‚Äôre not bad people. They were just not trained properly to represent your company as one that cares about customers.  Please spread social skills education to your drivers, so those with invisible disabilities or mobility challenges are not discriminated against.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-31T09:48:15-07:00

Please lower your prices for riders so we can be able to provide better tips for the drivers and PLEASE STOP updating the trips after they have already been successfully completed!! And please actually get a REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER!!!

9340497626,VgnVamp7,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id987505196,3.538.10002,3,Price jacking and Driver dumping,Unfortunately I have had to Uber for the past few months and the one thing I really cannot stand is the drivers dumping you after you pay and they accept then decide after five minutes or even more to dump the ride causing me to restart and wait longer. Not to mention sometimes the fees have gone up $15 or more during the time lapse. It takes alot of time playing the fee game every ride. The service of getting funds back is awful I‚Äôm certain there are times I never get it back n don‚Äôt finish a dispute because it‚Äôs such a horrible process. As much as I spend daily to foto work n my daughter going to and from school there are NO incentives or benefits. Drivers can play their offensive music keep the windows down and drive the route they choose even if you request they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt rock the boat because I have to use this service currently but definitely should be better to Good paying riders that always greet and are respectful of the drivers.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-28T21:06:33-07:00
8969064308,Cruggia,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id441581226,3.522.10001,1,very annoying things‚Ä¶.,"1. For some reason the app likes to tell me my driver is far away when they are literally around the corner. Had many drivers cancel on me for making them wait so long, but I didn‚Äôt know they were outside. 2. Every time I request an Uber it goes straight to Uber black. Not UberX. Now that your prices are insane. I most definitely can‚Äôt afford that. 3. Why am I being charged $20 to drive ten minutes away and then 25 to drive 40 minutes away. Also if the fare you offer isn‚Äôt the final price before tip, y‚Äôall are lying to your customers. 5. you need to have a better communication system. If I have keep digging through article after article to find solutions that don‚Äôt match my issue, I‚Äôm going to go insane.  6.  You guys over charge riders and give drivers a percentage. If you gonna over charge us so employees can make money give them the majority percentage. They do the work not you guys. 7. I completely understand the gas tax. I respect that struggle, but there is a fee for every little thing. You need to correct yourselves. You need better practices for your staff and your customers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-11T15:17:00-07:00
7870993965,kateagian,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id526219909,3.477.10002,1,Price gouging,I looked at the price for an Uber for a 6 mile ride from the airport to my home while I was walking to the baggage claim. I was quoted 16$. I didn‚Äôt order it until 10 minutes later. The price went up to 31$. Almost double. A friend of mine mine who used to drive for Uber told me some drivers don‚Äôt respond to the call intentionally right away because they will get a higher fare if they wait. The price is determined by the amount of the demand. So Uber and the driver benefit by pretending to be busy. The price doubled in 10 minutes. I was so surprised to find out what he told me is true. He said some drivers have figured out it‚Äôs more profitable to not respond right away and groups of them hang out together to drive the price up. So wrong. I wonder if lifts prices are also determined by availability of drivers versus how many people are waiting for a ride. This is a demand driven scale for pricing. And a ripoff. They need to either change the price scale and or stop the drivers from hanging out until the price doubles. Note not all drivers are doing this. Some are honest good people. I just read a review that lift is honest. Use them.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-02T16:51:00-07:00
