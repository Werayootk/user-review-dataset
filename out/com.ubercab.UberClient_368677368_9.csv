   I’ve got notifications turned on for Uber. For sure, when I’m using the app I’ve got to have complete communication with the driver at all times. And I don’t want to remember at airport in Cold with bags to turn notifications on or off!
   But ads??? If companies start using notifications more and more for That, then you can see the nightmare. I’ll get totally hammered with unnecessary junk.
