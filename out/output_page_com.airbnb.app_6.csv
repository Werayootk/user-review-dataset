We are always able to find unique places to stay that could accommodate our lifestyle. When you travel as a family you need the comforts of home to really enjoy your time away from home! Airbnb provides choices traditional options just don’t! I love the fact you can live like a local wherever you choose to travel. 
I have since become a host on airbnb and I am part of a family of travelers who expect the unexpected. I have the best time meeting people from all over the country and even the world and providing them with a safe, clean, homey environment that I know they can’t get anywhere else. I am a unique host with unique guests and I love every minute of it! Airbnb has certainly changed the way we travel and has changed the way we see our future!

If there were a strong alternative to Airbnb, I’d use it immediately. Directions almost never work. Linking to a map application fails every single time. Navigation is poor, as is the photo viewing in different types of views. In some, you can click to view a whole photo, in others you can’t, and those times are usually when you especially want to see an image. Some data is also not saved on the app, so you need access to the internet to see things like conversations with a host. Really critical stuff when you’re traveling abroad with often no internet. This app is the definition of “death by a thousand paper cuts.” I’m only writing this in hopes the dev team will see it and review their priorities.

She gave very vivid description of Roman life in Pompeii before the Vesuvius eruption, and then described in detail how the people tried to deal with the disaster, and then how they died. She also told us about the history of the discovery of the buried ruin of Pompeii, the history of various attempts to excavate it, and so on and so forth.

The picture they kept of me was taken from a surveillance video while checking into a guarded gate community. I’m pretty sure either way they never let me back on the platform that is their decision.

Most of the other properties in the area booked up, prices went through the roof. Things happen. But the process to contact support is terrible. Takes days for them to even respond to you in the chat, which in that time span other remaining properties are being booked, and the average price of the remaining spots increases. After a long delay in their initial response they then lied about how they would help compensate me. 

I accepted their initial offer of compensation, asked how to retrieve it in the chat and it took almost two days for a follow up answer, at which point they told me they couldn’t actually give me what they promised. I’m assuming it was a completely different person who I was talking to since it was such a long time in between responses.

Our flights are economy and non-refundable as well.

They absolutely refused to do anything else, more credit, compensate our flights even a small percentage, wave booking and cleaning fees, nothing.

- had to call the manager 3 times to have him remotely open the front door
- deck propane tank leaks gas when fireplace turned on
- air filter in living room has a thick layer of dust

Using the app vs the website - the app makes it difficult to see the specifics on what kinds of beds there are and what sizes. (EXAMPLE - Pull out couch vs Normal bed vs Blow up bed; and Queen vs Double vs Full).

I understand that an app can’t have ALL functionality of a full website, but the beds seem like a very basic essential factor to understand when choosing a place to stay - especially with multiple people.

Also - I HATE THAT AIRBNB ONLY GIVES A SHORT WINDOW OF TIME TO LEAVE PEOPLE REVIEWS!!!! What the crap is with that?! I think it’s like 3 weeks, which makes zero sense to me. AirBnB is sacrificing a large percentage of reviews because of that, which makes their platform less appealing and which means less likely to be utilized. 

I literally just left my first review today after what has probably been my 10th stay...because typically I am either still traveling in the time after I stayed at someone’s place, or I’m trying to get caught back up on my real life once I get home. So who has the time to leave reviews within 3 weeks and WHYYYYYYYY would you force that?!

Aside from price, I will always book through the platform that has the larger number of reviews so that I have the best chance that they are accurate.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2018-03-03T03:23:20-07:00

There is NO timeline to resolve this very real safety issue and the application does not have a way to report safety issues. You have to work with a team that seems to lose most of your notes from contact point to contact point. 

My car was parked in the provided parking on the street right beside my room. The room was a carriage house above a garage. There was no lock from the inside—only a flimsy latch—so it was only a garage door between me and whichever criminal broke into and ruined my car. The same night, other crimes took place on the same street. I spent a night of my stay waiting for the police to make a report and then for my car to get towed. 

I obviously did not feel safe. I told the host I would be checking out and handed her the key. She said I needed to work through the app to figure out the cancellation policy. It has been a week and I still have no resolution from AirBnB and at this point am on the hook for almost $1000 for nights I did not stay after being victim to a serious crime while I stayed at the property. This is completely unacceptable and would never happen in a hotel. 

I’m so disappointed and want to share this experience with other guests who might consider an AirBnB. Be warned: think twice before choosing an AirBnB over a hotel.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-16T08:38:57-07:00

Hard to see how one night will cost 60$ to clean up, especially when it’s customary to clean up after yourself. Airbnb should find a way to regulate this because it’s really disappointing to see what looks like a cheap fun stay for 105 and then realize you’re going to be spending over 200 for a tiny room in someone’s house once the cleaning fee and Airbnb service fee are added in.

If you are planning to host, you should def go for it! Even when it has rodents!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-01T08:50:26-07:00

Apparently because of some airbnb glitch they cancelled our booking on their own without any communication! And now they’ve asked to pay 5 times more than the original price to stay there! It was poorest service of all the time and we are extremely disappointed as now we don’t have booking to the place we’re going! The housekeeper in the scene is being supportive, but as a compony airbnb needs to pay attention to this matter and resolve it for us with courtesy to inform us before the cancellation as well as find a place to stay for our trip in same budget and same facility! Looks like they’re not even aware of their own glitch and we’re the one paying for it! Worst experience ever! Wish they had better service and communication skills!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-14T08:54:29-07:00

Erica is a top notch hostess and her appreciation for the arts, history and fun are demonstrated throughout. For those who like warm baths, a big fully equipped kitchen and a large table to eat at- you’ll find it here. If you are a music lover she has a record player with speakers throughout the first floor with an eclectic range of records and CD’s. There are also two keyboards. For young children there are plenty of places to sit and play, a backyard to play in and a large wrap around porch as well. It’s a great house with a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms. It’s a true gem and my family and I would highly recommend the captain’s house.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-06T12:55:56-07:00

1) Little accountability for hosts. 
2) Confusing pricing. 

Recently, I had a host cancel last minute because she tested positive for Covid. Completely understandable. However, I was in a bind for a last minute reservation. 

I applied for a couple places. A day later the hosts would say, “Oh I’m using the room during those dates, sorry.”  Why aren’t the hosts required to blackout the dates? I was losing a day each time. This half hearted accounting for vacancy was putting me in an ever more severe time crunch. Then there was no method to review the host for poor business practices (Apparently only a confirmed stay can review. ) This part of the process needs to be revised. 

Second, pricing. On the map feature, a price would be advertised… that had little or no correlation to actual price. I had to go through everyone to see what the actual price was. Changes for discounts and service/cleaning fees could change the price significantly up or down. The price of the stay needs to be shown to streamline the selection process. 

The idea of Airbnb is great… and has changed travel for the better. However, the execution could be improved. Filters for private bath or entrance would be helpful. I’m too old to share a head at this point.  Hopefully, the app can be developed to aid and hold non-committed hosts to some account.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-27T10:42:37-07:00
