However, I dislike being forced to download the app to access basic features of Google. For example, you cannot access Google Lens, ArVr, or a multitude of other core features in a web browser, you need the app to use them. If you want the Google app on your phone, you are fine; but I don’t really want the app. I would hardly ever use it, and when I do, it does have several bugs on an iPhone.

If this app was just an alternative to Google in the browser, I would give it 5 stars. However, I hate that it is becoming a “replacement”, and not a good one. I don’t know what the profit is from downloading an app, but I hope that Google will bring some of the aforementioned features back into the web version.

I even deleted the app and re-downloaded it to ensure it was the newest version. Don’t advertise a feature that clearly has not been tested.

As well, Google seems to be moving away from transparency, as there are layers and layers of Google settings that must be set or undone in layers and layers of corrections. And good luck finding most of what you need in one understandable UI.
