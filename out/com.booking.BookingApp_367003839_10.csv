The owner came out, helped me find the location (it’s not obvious but that’s a one time deal) and he made sure I knew everything I needed about the area.

Told me where to go out, where to eat, and if you need anything how to find it. The area is empty in the weekend during late hours, probably same during the week, and I always felt very safe. Best curry and roti is a block down the street. 

Fantastic experience, don’t spend hundreds of dollars in Barbados, stay here and you’ll get a simple room that’s super clean, super fast internet, and a genuine feeling of security when your head finally hits the pillow!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-22T23:06:39-07:00
