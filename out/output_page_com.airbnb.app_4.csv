It’s a great way to save money, travel and SAFELY stay in other people’s homes. Thanks to AirBNB’s review system, guests and hosts give each other feedback, which is a great way to have accountability and in turn means that if someone is remotely shady it will be public news. Also, they have the Super Host rating which hosts earn through providing excellent service. From my experience, I never stay with anyone who doesn’t have really great feedback or is already a Super Host. The best way to avoid weird situations (like one review mentioned a spider invasion!) is to always choose a Super Host and read the reviews carefully. 

I know there are a lot of negative reviews recently, but AirBnB is actually a great app that’s just trying to handle the virus situation as best as they can. Don’t give up on affordable travel and opportunities to meet locals just because someone else wrote a crabby, entitled review of them.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-16T16:50:28-07:00

Have had many instances of canceling your reservations without asking your permission, which results in a partial refund and requires you to go through the whole process over again; and, if you’re lucky to get the same reservation, it will cost 150% the actual cost.
They asked me to take a photo of the back of my ID. I have never had anyone ask for that side, not even for employment or government documentation. That’s the side with all the bar codes, btw.
I have seen many reviews complaining that representatives from the app do not respond well to inquiries or needs of customers. Requests for complete refunds in emergency circumstances (especially during the COVID-19 outbreak) went ignored. Requests for refunds in cases where the app automatically canceled a reservation without user permission (see above) also went ignored.
I am highly skeptical about the security and privacy of this app. If the program developed by this company runs like it’s employees or it’s financial system, I wouldn’t be surprised if this app were the target of a massive privacy leak.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-14T10:51:14-07:00

The cancellation policy is not even close to being as good as vrbo’s cancellation policy, and I don’t think that the cancellation policy that is in place due to corona virus is fair at all. (Airbnb gives 50% MINUS the service fee, after you cancel 48 hours from booking) they have changed their policy to offer 100% refunds for reservations made before March 14th, and for the bookings that are before mid-April. It is not certain that the pandemic will be continue after mid-April and it will most likely be continuing in the summer. With that being said, those families who will have no choice but to go out of town to their reservations in the summer to avoid losing their money will be put in danger of the virus by this very company. I wish I had booked through Vrbo, who has an extremely flexible cancellation policy and lower prices. (They give a full refund of the booking if you cancel by a closer date before the reservation, and their prices are lower for the SAME quality of places to stay) I will not be recommending this app to anyone traveling and I will never be using this service again for my future travels. 🤠",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-21T09:32:11-07:00

However, when I started doing more international travel and interested in experiencing these countries similar to what the locals experience, I’ve tried booking through the Airbnb app. My main criticism at this point is how quickly they take funds versus how slowly they release refunds. And the issue is not with my bank. Airbnb is holding my money. Nevermind that, by them doing this, might prevent someone from booking another place. Just ridiculous for them to keep funds for so long. I can’t recommend them or this app to anyone. Stick with hotels. I’ve had to cancel hotel reservations before and didn’t lose anything.

It was also very helpful while we were traveling overseas. It saved us a large amount of money booking rooms not in an expensive hotel. There are some risks using the service since you never know what kind of person you are booking from and the space where you will be staying isn’t always as nice as it’s presented in the listing. 

As for the app, I’ve encountered multiple problems with guests changing their booking.

Very long drawn out list of rules and some where I was supposed to send them lots of personal info. They have already said I had the room and they have my money. I was confused because I am a senior and was trying to do this on my phone and was tired. I have never been asked anything like this before. I just asked them if I had the room or not and told them I did not not understand what they wanted. I told them I wanted to cancel and they said I still had a legal obligation to pay them even though they had never once said that I was “approved"" for the room. I complained to Airbnb and was told they would investigate. Nothing from them but the host has since messaged me and accused me of being drunk, insulted and berated me all because I said I would not sign their additional paper work agreeing to all kinds of stuff I have never been asked before. I think this is fraud and misrepresentation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-01-14T19:15:21-07:00

I’ve been using this app for years, stayed in plenty of homes and had wonderful experiences, had plenty of great reviews in result of these stays! Until recently when I arranged a reservation that had been confirmed, money was taken out of my account on top of a pet fee that was demanded while it was never mentioned.. which was also paid immediately. A couple hours later I get an email saying my account has been permanently terminated because of my “criminal record.” I have a petty misdemeanor from 2015 on my record, one more year and it’s OFF of my record. I understand if a background check had been performed BEFORE I’ve stayed in peoples homes and THEN being denied but that’s not how this went. I’ve stayed in several homes with no issues and hosts welcoming me back for future stays. I wish I could make sense of this all but sadly I won’t even waste my energy trying to appeal because this is just downright WRONG. Will take my business elsewhere.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-10T10:20:23-07:00
6512148695,Mr. Facts Only,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id777124183,20.40,1,They don’t care about you,"I used this app twice to book reservations. First time 3 years ago for a place in Chicago. The place was filthy and did not at all look like the photos. I immediately left and cancelled the reservation. The week long battle with the renter that ensued was terrible. 0 support from airbnb resulted in me getting 10% back. That’s it, 10%. This obviously proves most people’s sentiment that Airbnb support only cares about the property owners and could care less about the people renting. The second time I used it I created a new account (I forgot about my previous one) and booked a reservation. I then was unable to find it and had to contact support to explain I created a new account because I forgot about my old one. They helped me deactivate the old account and all was well, or so I thought. I got an email and text notification 8 hours later saying my reservation had been cancelled and a refund would be issued. I then tried to log into Airbnb and my new account and my old account had both been deactivated. I’m never using this company again in my life. I’d give zero stars if I could.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-07T19:55:38-07:00
5449507107,xxinfinity,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id23912193,20.04,1,Doesn’t care about sexual assault,I was the victim of sexual assault at an Airbnb location and was unfortunately more traumatized by AirBnB and law enforcement. I was put on extensive holds by Airbnb when I tried to report it even after I told them what happened. More than 15 minutes. And no one got back to me. I think they were just trying to get rid of me. When I emailed them after cancelling the reservation they sent me a very adversarial email demanding a police report and basically saying I was a liar. I actually went to the police and they didn’t want to deal with it and it was more traumatic because they didn’t think I’d drive back for the prosecution since I was from out of town and so they didn’t want to do any work on a Sunday when no one was at the office in this small town. I will never stay at an Airbnb alone and with a host again. And beware Airbnb doesn’t care about victims. FYI you can’t get a police report immediately after an incident and even so you just got a number for the report not the full report. They were obviously just trying to revictimize me with this ridiculous request.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-25T20:36:05-07:00

Top of that customer services come up with complimentary coupons of $10-15 what a freaking waste of your money, time and more importantly your vacation precious times for which you have paid so much more than Airbnb reservation fees truly the worst customer services. I told them to keep $13 that was offered to me cause host cancelled my reservations at 6:30 pm when my check in time was 3:00 pm. I was told by customer services that this perfectly okay for host to do and they will give me $13 to make up for it. I had a toddler and my wife traveling with me I had to just cancel all my plans for the day and find another place at 7:00 pm so we can at least have a place  to sleep and pay premium fees for the last minute booking. Way to make money AirBnb your business and corporate policies will be shared with in my friends and family circle along with on social media. Hope you made money and also I know you guys don’t care much about your customers much.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-19T20:46:40-07:00

I’ve been using them for years and did not have a problem until we recently checked into our Airbnb in Maui Hawaii. The place was riddled with bugs! They’re called coconut condos, do not stay there! Anyway, we had to cancel on the spot and Airbnb refused to refund my money. We couldn’t stay there, there were ants everywhere, I have video, but Airbnb didn’t want to see that. Then they closed my complaint ticket before we even returned from our vacation!! The told me in a message that the refund policy stated that there would be no refunds. This is all on top of us having to find a hotel to stay in the last minute. Then, THEN, after contacting AirBnB and telling them about the problem - THEY DELETED MY ENTIRE TRIP FROM MY PROFILE - which makes it impossible for me to go back and leave a review of the place we had to cancel because it was infested with bugs!!! I couldn’t even get arm others!!! AirBnB only likes great reviews I guess, but if you have a bad experience it’s “F*** you, no refund and you can’t share your experience.” Stick with VRBO.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2018-07-12T22:46:47-07:00
