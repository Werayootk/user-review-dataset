I‚Äôm an operations manager of a company that streamlines communication between 100 plus people. The app does a good job for a task as big as our efforts continue to strive to be. 
My favorite element of outlook is the reminder/ to do list that it self regulates anytime I type an email using a word that implies me to do something. 
It has saved me a couple times. 

I put it at 4 stars because there has been a couple moments where I go back to look for an email, and it is not there. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but it has happened on a couple of occasions. 
All in all. Outlook is a great resource and I recommend it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-14T03:17:17-07:00

11042363698,chroko29,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id80021019,4.2408.1,3,Okay,"It‚Äôs kinda clunky. It could take a few notes from gmail app. 
Swiping to delete an email takes forever compared to gmail. Gmail you can swipe messages as fast as you want and they delete swiftly and effortlessly. Not with outlook. You swipe then you wait for it to delete. Then you can swipe again and you wait for it to delete. Over and over. Sure you can select but a lot of times you‚Äôd like to scroll and just swipe emails away. 
And it takes SO MANY clicks to send email to junk. 
I would really love to see sweep brought to mobile. That would be so handy. 
The killer is video size. It won‚Äôt even let you send a 30 second video in 2024. Eye roll. üôÑ it wants you to upload to their servers first for no reason whatsoever. Well, maybe they want to sell your video data or something. Anyways conspiracy theories aside it‚Äôs clunky and very limited compared to the web version. I‚Äôm not sure why devs can never deliver the same services on both platforms.
