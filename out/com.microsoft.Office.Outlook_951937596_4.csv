This version of the app has taken awake the feature to listen to audio file. Your iPhone must be in ring mode in order to listen to the files if your phone is in vibrate mode it will not play the audio. Switching from vibrate to sound will start to wear out your iPhone switch. Most of the people I know have their phones on vibrate so that is a bad feature to take away. Also if you leave the app or lock your phone the audio stops playing which is another horrible idea. They should have not taken this feature away! Now we much export the audio to our OneDrive or our Apple Drive in order to listen to audio and continue answering messages. We get a bunch of versions for 1 song so it is a hassle to have to download and delete every version that is sent to us.

5638781525,WashyFun,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id255329820,4.27.1,2,Average Mail App,"It’s a pretty good overall mail app, but not sure why it is rated so high. It has some seriously glaring issues, at least when linked to a Gmail account. Issues like:
1. It creates drafts that don’t go away after you send the email - so you look and think you haven’t replied because there’s an open draft. This is HORRIBLE if knowing whether you’ve replied is important to you. I’ve double-sent a few emails already. 
2. You can’t separate calendar integration. I’m running my calendar through a calendar app, so no reason for this to be fiddling with it. Creates redundancy and errors. 
3. Longer conversations are indented when reading back through the thread to the point you get a single character lines. Imagine trying to read a long email with one character per line. 

I still find it a better integration to Gmail than the native iOS Mail app, but only because Mail seems to not play nice with Gmail push notifications (as in I don’t get them). I’m not using Gmail (yet) because I was hoping to keep personal and work email notifications separate, BUT I may have to switch over. The draft problem is actually really bad for someone client-facing that doesn’t want to look like a chump not knowing when they’ve replied or not.

This practice removes the ability to use awesome applications like Mobile Day with voice command to join your next call when traveling.  This implementation makes the Outlook App for IOS unsafe for business drivers.  It’s not always possible to pull over and if the call drops your back to square one again.  

Microsoft,  please stop this isolation practice until the Microsoft Outlook application for iOS has all the necessary functionality needed for business travelers.

Why does this matter?  

Voice Command Missing: The lack of safe features like voice command, Siri or google voice command integration.  In the past we used apps like Mobile Day to make joint next meeting fast and easy.

Conference Call Automation’s: This app lacks the ability to assemble a conference call number with the passcode for automated calling.  If the person originating the call doesn’t create a single click line then you have to manually enter the information.  This is not easy when traveling.

Voice Reminders:  the calendar should automatically join the next call or remind you of the next meeting.

I hope Microsoft incorporates other calendar options to the calendar section so my iphone calendar can be added and this app can alert me to the birthdays I have saved in my contacts. I also wish the alert times were customizable and offered a second alert or a travel time alert.

It would also be nice if it had it’s own contact list to store contact information that I don’t necessarily want saved with my phone contacts.

After years of using the standard Mail app, I decided to switch because the Mail app is horrible when using multiple different emails. Dare I say, the Outlook app is better in every way, except one.

The Outlook app doesn’t seem to store more than 30 days worth of emails locally on my phone. So if I needed to find an email from, say June 2017, I type it in the search bar and then I have to continue pressing the “Load more conversations” button ~60 times until the app finally syncs back far enough with the server to load the email. And then, once you close the app, it doesn’t save all of the emails you just loaded so now you have to start from the beginning the next time you search for an old email!!

From trial and error, it seems to pull old emails in 2-week chunks, so god have mercy on your soul if you have to go back 5+ years.

It boggles my mind why this is a thing. I’ve looked through every single setting in the app and on the desktop web but there’s no option to extend this limit. Why not simply do one massive sync where you pull everything and then save a local copy on my phone so I can actually find what I’m looking for without spending 30 mins pinging the server over and over again?!

As emails accrue it gets comply to stay on top of emails that are tied to subject message trails. Also the move messages feature versus mail to other folders is clunky to directly move a message to its intended folder. The top 10 recent folders pop up is effective and should also be in the move to other folder features

Final suggestion, Google mail has a feature where to move a message to a folder you can start to spell the folder and it quickly identifies the folders alpha spelling range. Usually you only have to type a few letters and you can move it faster.

I use groups for emails and I can’t even see my old groups in contacts.  I turn off the ‘new outlook’ and there they are.

Perhaps there is some reason they don’t automatically make this available.  Maybe I’ll come back here and read up on it - likely won’t.  The new outlook looks great.  I agree with most of the reviews — both good and bad.  Microsoft with the switch to 365 has really been confusing to me as I don’t keep up with the tech side.  My email inbox of Microsoft 365 Message Center with the new features are usually deleted and perhaps I should give them more time, but that is precious commodity for me at this time.
