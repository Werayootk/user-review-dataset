11099578430,Better than the fb version,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id226947160,2024.13.0,3,Lots of bugs,"I’ve been using the app for over a year now and I don’t usually have complaints. But there have been sooo many bugs lately. I can no longer mute subs, it gives and error message. Even if I go into my settings and try and mute it that way it doesn’t work. Also I can’t leave posts on r/bugs to find out what the bug is. I can’t access my drafts or save any new drafts. There’s probably more but that what I’ve experienced this week so far. Please fix this. Especially the mute option. Some subs I really don’t want to keep seeing in my feed. Just checked apparently I can’t post on any subs period now. And it also randomly just stops working. Like no screen will load at all. In your next update can you fix these bugs.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T11:51:01-07:00

11095382820,Blindfromthebeginning,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1488312976,2024.13.0,3,Update seriously broke accessibility for voiceover users,some of the mess got cleaned up after the owner's brain spasm but after entering comment text it is often impossible to access the reply button and press the button. for that reason the app goes into deep freeze until next update and that update fails to fix problem the app leaves permanently. on account of that brain spasm this has limited use in linux and several other platforms and if reddit goes the way of compuserve genie and delphi it will be for the same excellent reason.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-28T09:01:41-07:00
