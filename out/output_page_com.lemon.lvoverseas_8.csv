This app lets you create any type of video or edits that you desire! I know when I started CapCut it was hard to find the right tools or effects for my videos but now this app is my go to for editing all types of videos. This might seem like a scam at first but trust me I have downloaded almost all of the editing apps on Apple and I guarantee that CapCut is the best one for you! If you have younger kids though I would recommend kinmaster but anyone above 8 should definitely download the app! Another cool feature is that for beginners there is an option where you can look at templates or what others have created and get inspiration from that too!!!!!!!!! 😜🤪😃😄😁😆😏,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-19T22:23:57-07:00

I went from not even knowing how to change the format to now I almost know how to do everything. Also, I’ve never had a problem with it lagging while editing. Also, I love how they made a PC version which is really nice. Moral of the story. If you’re looking for a easy to learn editor coming for me as a small YouTuber, who started with CapCut I just have to say CapCut is your option. One thing that kills me is that people say CapCut is for beginners. Its not, people with many thousands of subscribers use CapCut. You have you know what your doing. 

Also a little thing for CapCut!
 
If y’all made a pro version, like don’t lock any existing things, add new ones and charge not to much like 3-5$ a month maybe. I think a lot of people would buy it. Including me! But keep it mainly free and like if you want… we have pro. But don’t go fully like paid, because I think the reason CapCut is so popular because it’s free.

Literally it’s so hard to find an app that has good editing graphs that is free but this app is so good for being free, like I edit everything with this! I do have a question though! I was wondering if maybe you could add a folder setting, basically where you can take ur edits and store them in a folder on the app, so then if u have multiple edits that have to do with the same thing, you could put it in that category/ folder, that way if you wanna look at certain edits you would be able to go into that folder and look at the edit/vid!

I’ve had it for about a year now and it’s really fun to use especially when you make projects with the app! But there a tiny problem with the app that bugs me a little. The reason why I’m saying that is because whenever I add a black screen or something that is dark these random blue blurry dots appear for some reason and the app never did that before, and what’s even weirder is that it doesn’t show it on the CapCut app when I’m working on the video, it shows it when I upload a video. it happened around August I believe..for me at least.

This is a major problem for CapCut because little kids could possibly be on this. We shouldn’t kill her in other ppls videos bc it’s not going to do anything and even getting paid for it.

I like CapCut I have been using it for a long time to make my edits. There are a couple glitches but they don’t effect ur edit. I wish they would add new transitions, like where it blurs the whole video and not just behind the “object”. CapCut has really been updated since I got it! Also they should update the filters, some of them are kinda just well um crazy…

So if the developer of this app could change how much storage this takes up that would be great. Also, when I try to record my videos, I flip my camera, but when I try to flip it back around it won’t work.

There are so many things you can do in this app! So many different combinations you can choose from and make your videos unique. Although, I have 2 small requests that would make this better

1. I love making AMVs but when I insert GIFs, it just becomes a photo from a random scene in a GIF. I would really appreciate if you would let GIFs actually be GIFs instead of just photos

2. It would be cool if you could change the pitch without changing the speed. I also like making cosplay videos with music in the background and I like to make it look like the character is singing it. But, there are only so many versions of a song you can find on the internet. If you don’t get what I mean, take the song Control for example. All the male covers of the song is high and the character I’m relating to has a deep voice. I made the video slower, but I can’t make it too slow or it would look weird. I hope that makes sense.

If the template is in bikinis and showing things that kids that are on here shouldn’t see they should be banned from their account for two months if there’s anything like shaking the bottom is I would say OK.  Another thing is that you should make it to where you don’t have to sign in to be able to make great pieces and pay money. Other than that this is a great app. Just make it a little more PG for kids that also like to make these cool templates and videos.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-20T14:06:05-07:00

Also, everything pastes fine, but when it’s converted to subtitles, the text loses all quotation marks and apostrophes, requiring that you have to comb through the text and edit it manually for punctuation.

There is only one opportunity given to select photos. not once per project, I mean once per app installation. After that, literally anytime you use the app you can only use the ones you previously selected.
