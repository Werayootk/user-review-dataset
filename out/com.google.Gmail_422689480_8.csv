After months of using us and multiple updates, I see zero improvement. There‚Äôs no formatting functionality, the text selection is atrocious, and the app truly drives me nuts. I wish I could give this negative stars. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

What gives, Google? You have the best engineers in the world. Why can‚Äôt you focus on user experience?

I recently moved to GSuite and adopted this app to read my Gmail. I‚Äôm NOT impressed. The app makes it really difficult to select text when I need to edit something I‚Äôve typed. For some reason, it jumps around and makes it challenging to select a specific word or put the cursor in the middle of a specific word to correct a misspelling. I don‚Äôt have this problem in other apps on the same device. 

In addition, there is no formatting capability. What the heck? I can‚Äôt even add bullets or bold face. When I copy/paste something in from another app, that pasted text retains whatever formatting was in the original version. There‚Äôs no way to clear formatting so that it looks like part of the email.

I like the fact that it allows me to organize the email the same way that Gmail allows, but the level of effort necessary to compose a simple message is truly aggravating.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-26T08:44:53-07:00

EACH email is potentially EVIDENCE in our ongoing, high-conflict situation. 

Gmail has become increasingly problematic. 

Some issues seem to have to do with areas where you have spottier connectivity. (Instead of taking it slower and preserving your information, however, Gmail gets cranky and throws a tantrum)

Formatting anything increases the risks that your message will turn out wonky. (Italics seems to be much worse than Bold) Entire swaths of text can go invisible after the message is sent. There isn't necessarily an obvious rhyme or reason to what is left. 

Even just EDITING a message while not sitting still in a 5-bar or maxed Wi-Fi environment -- passing through a dead zone in a car, for instance -- can TOTALLY screw you over when you send your message from a better location!

But ultimately, YOU end up looking like an idiot, when Gmail isn't doing what it is supposed to do.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-26T14:18:10-07:00
