Then they changed my fee and charged me $54 for a ride that was supposed to be $20 when I booked. Guess why? They changed it to XL. As a military member I‚Äôm on a very fixed income and this has stolen money from me so many times. I‚Äôve tried contacting them but there‚Äôs has been no real person to speak with.
