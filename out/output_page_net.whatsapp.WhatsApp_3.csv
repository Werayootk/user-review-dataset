What I believe is missing is more control of who can video or voice call a person. There should be an option to block random phone calls. Maybe have an option to set a time frame of when and when not receive video or voice calls. Maybe also add an option of ‚Äúnever‚Äù or only allow calls from saved contacts.

However, there are a few issues I have with this:

1. I am not sure if this is just my connection, but whenever I am in a video or voice call, I often find that it keeps disconnecting me from the call and a lot of times, I cannot hear the other person.

2. The thing that really bothers me when it comes to calling others on here is that if the connection gets screwed up, I will constantly hear this loud beeping sound, which gets very annoying after a while.

What I personally suggest would be to have it where it doesn't beep so loud. Some could say that I am just sensitive to that, but I find that even if the volume is very low, the beeping can be quite loud, while I can barely hear the one I am talking to on the line.

Again the constant disconnecting could be because we are in 2 different countries or it could be my internet speed. The thing that I would really like to see change is definitely removing that assinying beeping sound!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2018-05-01T04:46:44-07:00

 Here are a couple of features I wish to see in WhatsApp:

LAST SEEN:
- Exceptions: in addition to the original options (Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody), *Exceptions* gives you the option to include or exclude specific contacts from the above settings.
(Telegram app already has this! I don‚Äôt know why WhatsApp hasn‚Äôt!)

READ RECEIPTS:
- option to turn on/off *read receipts* for INDIVIDUAL contacts. (iMessage already has this option!)

Or similar to the Last Seen options (in telegram):
- ‚ÄúEnable Read Receipts‚Äù for: Everyone, My Contacts, Nobody,‚Äù with Exceptions!

The purpose of the additional options is:

We all have a variety of contacts. From those who bombard you with messages when they see you were recently online (and/or text you as soon as they see the Read Receipt) to your friends who are more respectful of your space.

We have some contacts from whom we‚Äôd rather have more privacy; while others with whom we‚Äôd like to have more transparency.

Another feature I would love to see it to be able to search stickers by typing in search banner. I know it is hard because they are not categorized but maybe there‚Äôs something to do.
Another feature I recommend is not to put message deleted when someone delete a message. Apparently if someone deleted a message they don‚Äôt want the other person to know that they deleted one.
One more feature I am looking for is the ability to sort chats in different ways, read and unread, by name, by time and so on.

One quip I have about this app is that although you can change the background wallpaper on the display between WhatsApp's included styles, solid color choices or personal pictures of your own, there is *-no_way-* you can change the font, it's color nor the bubble color behind what you‚Äôre writing.  

After all these years, I'm still irked by not having the freedom of creating and affixing my own style-stamp for chats.  That 'creative freedom', as an option, is as fundementally necessary to express myself as is the message it contains. 

Another vein of increasing public necessity is encryption for video, chat, calls, etcetera. 

Both suggestions are an easy addition.
