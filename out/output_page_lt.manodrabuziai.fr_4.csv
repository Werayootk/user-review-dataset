Shame on you guys for making it even harder for people to thrift at a time like this where everything is expensive, and to the sellers that are loosing sales because of it, I hope they reduce their shipping soon until then I won’t be shopping on Vinted.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-11T07:07:35-07:00

I sold on here and also bought and traded with others. The shipping costs used to be so reasonable. .99 maybe 1.99 or 2.99 if the items were heavier but now even the lightest t shirt.. the shipping cost is like $6-$12. That is a HUGE increase and isn’t worth buying anything anymore. Not to mention it’s near impossible to sell anything because no one wants to pay the ridiculous shipping costs,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-13T10:04:16-07:00

They always had the best prices and reasonable shipping prices but a little over a month ago they suddenly DOUBLED their shipping prices without any warning.
