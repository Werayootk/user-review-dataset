Because that is a game changer. ChatGPT has boosted my productivity level significantly. It’s like a personal assistant that knows a little bit of everything and it helps me follow through with my ideas. It helped me start an follow through on a couple of projects because I can ask it questions when I feel stuck or conversate to either agree/disagree with what it says, or to get to know why he said what he said. I have overall found it helpful in all tasks even menial tasks like listing a couple of food items I have and telling the bot to make a meal with it.

If you’re in high school like me, you would know that the stuff that we do is pretty difficult. I use ChatGPT for essays, written responses (I do online class) and sometimes science and biology. But… ChatGPT is pretty bad at mathematics. I tried doing logarithms with it and it made me fail my paper. I thought it was right, so I confronted my mathematic teacher and told them that they graded it wrong. But… They didn’t. THE WHOLE THING WAS WRONG!!! I don’t know if it’s just bad at logarithms and calculus or if it’s just bad… But other than that it’s pretty good if you’re in school.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-25T07:56:18-07:00

I just wanted to provide another big important detail just in case you didn’t know what I wrote in the other review I stated and talked about the book fixes that ChatGPT needs. ChatGPT needs some bug fixes, but not a lot overall the app is really good, but just needs to be better at working on responses it was hard for them to construct to work on responses when it comes to math it doesn’t give you the exact reply you needed or that you wanted to get. I hope you reconsider this and make a change on these slight bug fixes, please try to make a change so all of these app users feel comfortable and happy when using this app you should also listen to many other reviews that people have left.
