Our neighborhood is undergoing some MAJOR street construction, so the postal carrier is having to walk part of his normal route. Unfortunately, on October 19, he scanned my TEMU package at 5:19 PM as having been delivered to my porch, but then inadvertently hand-delivered it to another house down the street. Although they have attempted to convince the neighbors to return the package to the USPO so it may be delivered to me, the neighbor refuses to do so, leaving me without my TEMU products. This is VERY DISAPPOINTING because I was greatly anticipating the items in that order. Sadly, NEITHER the U.S. Postal Service nor TEMU will accept responsibility, so I am left without my order OR the money I paid for same. I‚ÄôM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS, BECAUSE UNTIL THIS ORDER, THE SERVICE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD AND ON-TIME. IT IS A SHAME THAT NO ONE IS WILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND EITHER REFUND MY MONEY OR RESEND MY ORDER!!!

This is common sense. I've made countless orders on Temu, receive them quicker than I do on Aliexpress/Alibaba, and is cheaper. Not only do they provide you $5 if the order is late, but you are subject to a price adjustment if a store increases their price within 30 days after your order, which is amazing because theyre protecting you from vendors trying to lowball you!!! As with any order online, it's a risk for your account/info to get compromised or hacked, but that's a risk we all take making any purchase online. Not sure why people say this is a scam, I've received all my orders and have never had an issue. Of course, always remember, you will get what you pay for.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-11-29T19:39:13-07:00"},{"id":"10767398817","userName":"Fairestskye","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id104678092","version":"2.32.0","score":5,"title":"I am having fun with this app.","text":"Lots of things to choose from and a fun shopping experience right from your bed. Things are inexpensive and ship for free. There are a little coupons and price reductions that are nice. Everything ships from China, but happens a lot faster than you would expect. I have been pleased with everything I ordered which has included jewelry making equipment to clothing. The only negative is getting so many alerts on my phone, but I can adjust that. I also get a lot of texts every single day about sales and I can also unsubscribe from those text messages or you can choose to ignore, obviously, those texts. Overall safe, easy to use, and I guess there are games you can play to win items but I‚Äôve not done that yet. I have had no problem with glitching or inaccuracies.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-31T08:51:14-07:00"},{"id":"10388316655","userName":"Tamii_babii01","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id21935706","version":"2.6.0","score":4,"title":"Only one problem so far","text":"Everyone said this app was a scam and just like other things it‚Äôs not!!

Don‚Äôt expect the same discount for your subsequent purchases. Order takes about 2 -3 weeks to come. Some items are really good  and worth the price but some are just  crap. You get what you pay for basically. With how cheap everything is you can‚Äôt really expect good quality. It‚Äôs kinda like shopping at the dollar store. Shipping is free with 10 dollar purchase. \nThey are so aggressive with marketing. I probably get a minimum of 5 e-mail  from them everyday. Thank God I didn‚Äôt subscribe with the text messaging. Now regarding the free gifts, you‚Äôll only get them if you can get other people to sign up. My issue now with Temu is the pricing. When you look at the cart everything is itemized but if you add it yourself the total just don‚Äôt add up. I think they were counting on people not checking and just paying whatever they charge, don‚Äôt get me started on costumer support it‚Äôs pretty much non existent.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-17T09:36:55-07:00"},{"id":"10679634707","userName":"Awsometraveler","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1420878185","version":"2.26.0","score":5,"title":"Temu Shocked me!","text":"I must say that I‚Äôm quite surprised and pleased with most of what I‚Äôve ordered on Temu!

Merchandise and items that look this great on the website is probably crap when you get it home?! lol \nWell, absolutely just the opposite! Yeah, we shoppers will always experience some bad deals anywhere at any time! I‚Äôm sure even in here as I‚Äôve heard. Be to be honest, no company can please anyone all of the time! That‚Äôs why you have customer service, support and management! I can truly say that so far I‚Äôve been quite pleased and impressed with what I‚Äôve ordered! And I‚Äôve ordered quite a bit!  This makes me now a true loyal customer an fan! Yesss! I‚Äôll recommend Temu to family and friends! I already have!! lol ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüòÇüëègreat job!

They have so many unique and awesome items. I have purchased a little of everything from them. Clothing, electronics, kitchen gadgets, makeup, and even home decor. All of which have been delivered a lot faster than their competitors. No waiting a month to get something. And it‚Äôs packaged together and nicely. No random package wrapped in packing tape that looks suspect. It‚Äôs in a Temu branded package and shipped with legit tracking from the shipping agent. The items are always as described and in some cases even better than they appeared in the ads. I will continue to shop here and promote them to all my friends and family. The Holidays are coming up and I def will be using them to fulfill my shopping list and I will be adding some things to my ‚Äúwant‚Äù list from Temu as well.

A lot of these reviews are fake please just take 2-3 minutes out of your day to listen to this. I ordered around 20 things off temu. The packaging came BROKEN and I ordered a pencil bag for my daughter's school and it came broken. I ordered a poster for my son's room and it came bent and torn. Many people's information is getting sold to the dark web unless you have a REALLY strong and protective card I do not recommend this app. Just warning you about this app. Mind you not even all of my stuff came in and most of it came broken. I would recommend researching the parent company which has been removed for selling users' information on the dark web Currently Temu is going through the same issue. The reason you see so many amazing reviews is just all bots, if you read the names some of them are just scribbles like ‚Äúeiabcoe‚Äù ‚Äújsixipqhx‚Äù ‚Äúqwufbx‚Äù etc or they are names that are in China. Don't listen to the positive reviews unless you want to get scammed. Thank you for reading and I hope you don't buy anything off Temu.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-02T10:01:58-07:00"}]
