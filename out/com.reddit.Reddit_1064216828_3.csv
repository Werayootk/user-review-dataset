I can’t say that anymore; the Reddit PM who owns the mobile app straight up ignores constant constructive feedback about the negative changes being made and the UX continues to worsen.

Really wish they’d make their app more desirable to use rather than banning the “competition” and not fixing anything. Now you have to use their app and have no other alternative if you don’t like it, other than just not being able to use Reddit at all. 

Many subreddits shut down in protest of this change but Reddit threatened to kick off all the owners and moderators and replace them with their own people (empty threats if you ask me, they can’t source enough loyal-to-reddit-upper-management people to replace all of them) but people caved anyways instead of following through on the strike, so now we’re here.

A few years ago, Reddit released this, the official Reddit iOS app. It is slow, buggy, unintuitive, and frustrating to use. Therefore many people chose to stay on the third party apps. Recently, reddit made extremely predatory and greedy changes to their API usage policy that effectively destroyed the third party apps, and forced app developers to shut down their apps. This was a move to force all users onto their slow, terrible native reddit app. 

Reddit had two options. Make a product so good, no one wanted to use third party apps, or squeeze and force consumers into using a heaping pile of garbage because they are too incompetent to do what a single app developer was able to do, make a good app.

Reddit used to be a place where you could find anything and everything. My ideologies and attitudes and personal philosophies and opinions have grown and evolved over time.  Reddit was one of the reasons why I am an open-minded individual. I am much more eager to listen to opposing views, in order to find common ground with people who are very different from me. I’ve learned to have productive and civil conversations. I have been motivated to become a more knowledgeable individual on a variety of issues.

The content that remains is still good. However, I believe that it is inexcusable that Reddit has censored / deleted / banned / restricted / removed many posts and subreddits over the years.

Many of us on the internet came here because it was NOT the basic / polished / scripted GARBAGE that television has become. We migrated to the internet for the freedom of ideas and expression that was nowhere to be found elsewhere.

Heed my warning. It’s all good, until they consider your ideas dangerous, and they come after you. Please return Reddit to its former glory, and restore freedom of expression. Otherwise, people will leave, and you will become the relic media that you deposed.

Some specific, egregious examples include tapping the comments button making the video go full screen and start playing instead of showing comments, not having a pause button when the video is in its condensed form above the comments… but those seem to have been fixed in the latest update. 

But the follies keep coming. It is so clear that the adjustment of the playback control positioning never got tested on a modern device without a home button. You literally can’t scrub videos without iOS trying to swap between apps. It’s right on top of it. Apple added safe area insets to UIKit YEARS ago. Did this change never leave the simulator before hitting the App Store?

While I’m here, let me share a few (what I feel like are obvious) suggestions if the devs read this. 

- Video playback should always have a pause button without having to make a video full screen. This includes playing it in-line on the feed view. 
- Swiping up between full screen videos jumps past non-video content. It’s really not useful. Make that swipe up gesture bring the comments up instead or dismiss like it does for images
- if you’re going to have a setting named Autoplay: Never, maybe actually have it never auto play videos unless I’m actually tapping play on the video. Just a thought.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-24T08:49:04-07:00

The app has come a long way. Moderation can *almost* be exclusively done from a phone, but still continues to be much easier on a PC using mostly third-party tools, still. It’s a great app, though. Some strange behaviors when using built-in browser for external links, but they offer the ability to offload those to your default system browser. iOS now allows you to choose your default browser, so this means you can let chrome or Firefox or whatever be the app that opens from clicking links in the Reddit app. Great feature. Generally, this app works well, but as a companion to, not a replacement for, desktop/browser use. 

**old review for comparison**

For an official app, it's really lacking features. It can't even read it's own markup language. Instead, it actually displays the literal input when somebody tries to do any sort of formatting. The moderation components are infantile but workable. I really would love auto-comment/PM upon removal templates but for now this works, to a degree.

Simply by expressing an opinion that is not part of their own narrow view, you can - and I have - be “banned for life”.

The main reason I’m giving this app 4 Stars and not 5 however is because of a lack of functionality. It’s currently missing the ability to display the Wiki sections of subreddits - and that’s a major drawback, especially for certain subreddits whose content is basically centered around their wikis. Also, the inability of the app to display “old reddit” - or its inability to show what a particular subreddit looks like in its old-reddit-styling - that’s a major drawback as well, as certain subreddits have still not upgraded to new Reddit, and lose much of their functionality when forcibly viewed in new-Reddit-styling.

For a social media platform that relies so much on viewing media, these kinds of issues are inexcusable.

A more pressing issue, and one that makes the app borderline unusable, is the severe battery drain it causes. On a 14 Pro Max, a less than one year old device with a large battery and 95% battery health, Reddit drained 60% of my battery in one day. And that was with only 2 hours of screen on time, the rest was due to background activity.

Your CEO accusing the Apollo dev of trying to blackmail Reddit into buying out Apollo is an absolute joke, especially since the conversations were recorded and released today. It’s obvious this business doesn’t care anything about its users and just want to price out the competition to force as many people onto their official app to be force fed as many ads as possible. 

My account is 10 years old and when Apollo closes down on June 30th, I’ll be done with Reddit. I’m not the only one either. The post in the Apollo subreddit announcing its end has 180,000 upvotes right now. Pretty much everyone there is saying they’re going to quit Reddit altogether over this. And that’s just for Apollo, not all the other successful third party apps you’re going to kill by doing this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-09T07:58:23-07:00

I don’t use the app often at all and yet last month it consumed 225 GB of data which is astronomical compared to any other app on my phone. So I reach out to support, why is Reddit black holeing my data? And they never respond. 

By the way if you post a joke in Game Builder Garage community and the moderators of that community instantly ban you for breaking the rules cause the game u made was inappropriate, then you apologize to the moderators and ask for privileges back because you truly do enjoy the game and would be a solid contributing member of the community, but they refuse to budge on their hard-line approach to being the bosses of Game Builder Garage players and uphold your ban so you make a new account and a vile, super innapropriate game and post it in the community until the mods ban you again, so you make another account and do the same thing, over and over again, Reddit will eventually ban you for life even if u make a new account. 

Which is completely uncalled for if u ask me",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-11T02:12:38-07:00

I’m a gay man who has been with my same-sex partner 34 years. What makes you people think I’d want anything to do with a young tart looking for a sugar daddy?

Your communities are BLOCKING you. I’m going a step farther:  I deleted my account, removed the app, and removing every single incidence of “Reddit” from my hard drive and my search history.  

I’m responding by giving Reddit ONE STAR. 

Obviously, you’ve taken THEIR side. Maybe you should merge with Truth Social and give your membership list to Donald Trump, so he can arrange to have LGBTs, liberals and progressives pushed out of a plane like Augustin Pinochet, when Trump returns in glory to establish his thousand year reign on earth. /snarkasm  

Why don’t you get your lawyers together and SUE ME for my insolence?  That’s sure easier and quicker than doing the necessary work to fix your own internal problems.

There’s to much false information about Massacres and communist crimes and a lot of anti-western lies (Soviet Famines, Holodomor, The Great Leap Forward, Russo-Ukraine war, Western Wars in the middle-east, Chinese Human Rights violations, Soviet Russian Human Rights violations, Current censorship in China, everything about the North Korean Dictatorship, etc…) and this stuff being allowed to be spread about because of revenue. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge Capitalist and I care less about whether a company will take action because it’ll make them money and waste their miserable lives but to allow victims to be called western liars? To dismiss the real life experiences of people in a system because they’re so coddled by media? Foolish.

It's incredibly frustrating to have the method for collapsing a comment be completely changed without any notification other than what was nested in the app updates description. I don't understand why it was changed in the first place from just tapping the upper area of the comment next to the user name, but without any sort of note that it had been changed I spent a few minutes thinking the app was broken, and really only stumbled on the long tap functionality by accident. Would have never guessed to double tap a comment since that's usually reserved for upvoting things in other apps.

UX devs, PLEASE don't rewrite core functionality without giving users any update in-app that it's been rewritten. At least give a one-time pop up or something letting me know what it's been changed to.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2018-02-27T13:36:19-07:00
