I spent money on Reddit in this account! I have been creating original content for the community I‚Äôm most involved in, with some recent posts having 3,000 - 4,000 some upvotes. I would spend hours scrolling, being hit by ads the whole time.

What is wrong with you guys?  You have a huge bot problem on your site already and then you perma-ban actual participating humans for nothing after nearly 12 years?

Number two is that when there IS useful information, there are so few comments you can count them on the fingers of your hands, often one hand. That‚Äôs not very informational. And then they close discussion too quickly so you can‚Äôt ask another question on the matter. 

Sometimes, on some subReddits, there is useful information I must admit.  Give it a try and see how it works out for you. There are so many subjects, It‚Äôs hard to give a definitive evaluation.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-15T01:38:42-07:00
