Huh? That makes no sense. If yk that is a minor doing things like shaking butt and Instead of taking it down you change it to where only people of older ages can watch it how does that help?

11063428110,DyllanRain,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1562804288,19.10.7,4,YouTube is great! Just be warned:,"Hi, I’ve been a user for 3 years and I have to say, YouTube is probably one of my favorite social media apps! Very inclusive and offers a wide range of topics and interests! There is a downside though. I’ll list some things below:

Negatives:
-Inappropriate content for minors and/or younger teens
(Ads for adult websites and nsfw clickbait is a common factor)
-bad camera quality
(If you create YouTube content, like I do, then I recommend not filming on the actual website. Find a different app to record on, then import the video onto YouTube. Even then, YouTube messes up the quality of it)
-toxic comments and audiences
(YouTube is a common place for toxic messages and overall just horrible people. YouTube is pretty lax on there monitoring system, so almost nothing ever gets taken down.)

Now, I know that may not seem like a big deal to some people, but it’s usually younger kids and/or teens on this app. So, for any parents reading this, be careful and make sure to monitor your own kids watching limits! Now even if it seems all bad, it’s still a wonderful website that allows you to find community and entertainment right at the swipe of a fingertip! Highly recommend!!!

(P.S. YouTube, please be more strict on your monitoring system, the amount of people that have nsfw content posted up is insane. Thank you)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T17:01:26-07:00
