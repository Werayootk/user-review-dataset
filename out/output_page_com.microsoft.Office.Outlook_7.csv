1) it downloads only a set number of emails into the app and when you try to search for an email it searches the oldest emails in your account first (I.e. on the sever) so imagine how long it takes to get a result with recent emails. You will be waiting for a while. Then, the results are not comprehensive like in the Apple’s Mail app. These two things render this app useless.
2) Outlook gives you an option to link in calendars but it won’t link to your default iOS calendar that’s on your iPhone. Microsoft will tell you to sign in with your iCloud email account to link it but I don’t have iCloud email account but yet I have iOS calendar that I use and need. Other competing apps ( ex. Calendars) link up to iPhone’s calendar w/o any iCloud log ins and work wonderfully. Outlook will only work with calendars that’s in your email, eg Gmail.
3) customer support leaves a lot to be desired and is a hit and miss. Some responded right to the point, others don’t by giving you the typical half answer that we came to get accustomed from customer service in foreign countries that CS is being outsourced to.

Just create a task and it appears in your list, then archive the email and your inbox is now wonderfully manageable. When you go back and click on the task, viola! It brings up the related email and you can get right to work. Such a brilliant feature. 

Oh, but this is the Quadriplegic Version of Oulook. You can check your emails... but that’s about it. You can’t see your task list. You cannot turn your emails into tasks. It’s like cutting off the best part of a thing for fear that it might become too successful. Is it that Microsoft feels that they need to throttle down features on Apple platforms because they don’t want to give people yet another reason to ditch their PCs for Mac products?

Where is a command for “Go To” to a specific date.  Their Go To takes you to the various functions within the calendar-a feature listed in te bottom left hand corner.  Why bother?   If I want to see a date, in say, 1965, I have to keep clicking months from the present month 56 freakin’ years.

And...enter a birthday.  No...not directly in the app.  Go to Outlook on the Web for Mac.  Enter your new birthdate by creating a new contact.  Don’t add a birthdate to an existing contact.   That doesn’t work. Think you got it now?  When you sync to Outlook for Mac the birthday shows over two days, or as the next day totally ignoring the correct date.

The area that needs the most improvement has to do with finding and organizing people which is something I do frequently. You have to do too many taps to locate and edit people and it’s also rather confusing. Not sure why the email and calendar portion is given such prominence, but people management seems to be an afterthought. Also confusing is when you search for someone’s name it shows duplicate search results even if there’s only one record.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-31T07:41:51-07:00

Support advised that developers are aware of issues, which is the feedback I received back when I previously contacted.

Unfortunately, there’s no way to correct this.

Imagine being involved in an email thread with pretty important people and some of your messages are 10 pt. font in a calming blue with a nice signature and some of your messages are in a clunky 12 pt. font in black with a skewed signature.

However, the ability to do certain things directly within the app, and the synchronization with calendar are fantastic.

Oh - another note: could we please be allowed to copy and paste events within calendar? Or at least have an auto-fill suggestion from previous events, like Apple does?
