YouTube’s removal of this feature now prevents users from determining the overall quality of the content they wouldn’t have to view had they been able to initially view the count for dislikes.

Please change this back, there was no reason to do that. 

Also when a video finishes playing the next recommended videos pop up on the bottom of the screen making it hard to access the full screen button, so when I am trying to go in or out of full screen I almost always inadvertently press another video and then have to go all the way back out to get to what I was watching.

Most of the videos displayed in the Home screen no longer show the video length timestamp in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail which is really irritating. It looks like all other views in the app show the timestamp, so hopefully it’s a bug that’s fixed ASAP. A couple random videos in the Home list show the timestamp while the other 95% do not, which makes no sense.

Sometimes the video rotation gets stuck in landscape and will not revert back to portrait view, only the opposite landscape view. This has been a problem for a few months now, and the only way to fix it is to force quit the app. This is quite irritating. 

Finally, a good addition but extremely overdue feature is the ability to sort the Watch Later playlist. FINALLY this utterly BASIC feature exists. I have no idea why the Watch Later playlist worked so differently than regular playlists for so long, but that’s fixed now. 

The best addition from a few months ago was the feature of double-tapping to rewind and fast forward. Every video player needs this. It’s incredibly user friendly.

On my phone it often gets stuck in limbo so I move on to another article or just quit flipboard in frustration.

The math channel is cluttered with bike articles that have nothing to do with math. I guess you all expect that mathematicians love to ride bikes more than read about math. Other channels are similarly afflicted with content unrelated to the channel.

People want a better reading experience and flipboard is no longer providing that hence the one star.

My apologies for the harshness of this review, I like flipboard and the way it presents articles in newspaper format but there has to be a better way to improve article reading without dynamic ad clutter like pop ups or delayed inline ads or pay site articles.

Your censorship is applied terribly inconsistently - one video will be taken down while ten others running far more afoul of your rules will remain. I’ve begun to look at other platforms (like Odysee) even though, for familiarity’s sake, I’d prefer to just stick with this one.  That said, your platform still contains more videos on a wider range of topics than your competitors do, but that won’t last if you keep this up.  

Protools used to be my DAW (digital audio workstation) of choice, but they allowed themselves to fall behind depending on their status as the “industry standard” to keep them relevant.

    Another problem is the search results can be weird. I try to search up a video of an game or show I like and (even if the game/show is completely appropriate) it’ll show me inappropriate content that I have no intention of watching and just leave me disturbed.

However, I am not sure what is happening to human engineering at Google.  Each new update seems to make the app less intuitive and more difficult to use.  

Ex:  
1. Pausing a video to view something on the video in more detail (chart, text,...) is now impossible unless you know the hidden trick.  Paused videos now darken the screen and place a LARGE play icon in the middle of the screen, making it impossible to view the paused video.  This makes the large segment of teaching/how-to videos much less effective.

2. When saving a video, you no longer get to select where it will be stored. YT now stores it in the last used playlist.  This requires you to stop, figure out how to pull up the saved video, and remove it from the wrong playlist YT saved it to, and then save it to the one YOU wanted it to go to. YT no longer thinks you are smart enough to know where you want to save the video.

Youtube/Google engineers believe taking options away from users is some type of “improvement”?!  Give me a break!!  

My recommendation is to no longer trust Google to do the right thing, and not accept YT updates until you research what less fortunate reviewers are reporting about each new update.  It’s the only way to prevent losing useful features. And don’t even get me started on the increasing number of Ads YT is showing with almost EVERY video.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-27T06:20:39-07:00

When listening to music I can’t even look away from the device because after every minute it plays the WORST ads, and the ads last 20mins unless you go to the device and press skip. The point of listening to music is not to stay near the device so you can skip horrendous ads that are actually embarrassing to play on speakers for everyone to hear. Ya, we are supposed to PAY for ad free listening but that’s a scam to put such horrific ads that do not end. Do better with the ads. Why make us suffer until we pay more just enjoy a free platform. This ruins my whole experience and I just can’t anymore.. I have to leave this review and say it’s horrible. I love this platform but the ads make it miserable. Keep the ads but make them better! I get it for the additional profit of paying for ad free listening . But at this point it feels like a scam to have to suffer THIS MUCH unless we pay for less suffering.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-18T11:35:03-07:00

Can there be an option to always choose the HIGHEST quality possible or always choose one specific quality? One that if a video doesn’t have that quality then it chooses the closest thing to it, but the next video that CAN play in your set preferred quality will automatically choose that quality setting. 
I always want to watch things in their highest quality, which is usually 1080p60, but the high quality button always chooses 720p60? I just want to set a standard quality for ALL of the videos I watch so I don’t have to change the quality every video, I thought it wouldn’t be too annoying to change it so often but it’s really been building up and annoying me since the update. Please change something to make it more concrete if possible?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-28T20:06:24-07:00
