So then I decided to reset my phone but it once again, didn’t work. My last shot was deleting the app and getting it again cuz I thought for sure it would work. I was wrong. I tried sighing in but it just kept saying “error”. So I currently have nothing to really occupy my time.

I loved using it as an online photo album. Recently i have noticed a change in their “algorithm”. I followed many pages both related to cars and alternative women, typical for most people my age. Every time i opened this app, i only saw women. Every single time, first post i had seen. I have spent days unfollowing 1000 pages including models and pages that sponsor common trendy audios and edit clips. I now follow less than 1000 people, and my page feed has shifted drastically. 
Now, instagram, has decided that the other 850 people that i follow are no longer worthy of my feed and it still shows me ONLY WOMEN AND CARS. regardless if i follow them, i dont see any pages i actually do follow and my feed has become only suggested posts that get more attention on their “algorithm” from people that dont follow them already, than the people that follow the pages i do.
This has been the biggest downslope of changes ive seen on an app more so than it becoming unavailable. Losing facebook from my phone was okay for me.

1.) give us the option to have a comment section on our story posts — kind of like how there were comment sections on our IG TV’s and Reels! this will allow us to comment on someone’s story without having to bring the conversation to their dm’s. it would be so convenient!
2.) have categories for our posts — i think it would be super fun to have different sections for our feed, maybe 3-5? it would be interesting to be able to place our posts into different sections! one could be music the other could be travel another could be family etc!!! 
3.) audio features — twitter recently added an audio feature and i would love for instagram to add one too! however it would look, i know a lot of my followers and i would appreciate having it!
4.) post videos longer than a minute — i’m not totally sure about the reason behind why instagram only allows one minute videos to be posted onto our profile but allowing us to post longer videos would totally change the game!
5.) post links in comments and captions (and maybe even pictures gifs and videos) — having this feature would benefit a lot of people especially big accounts and small business! as for the pictures gifs and videos, it would be super awesome to be able to reply to people with these!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-11T16:36:30-07:00

     First of all, why was chronological order ever taken away???? What was the reason??? There is nothing more frustrating than seeing a bunch of posts OUT OF ORDER. I just want to be able to like someone’s post without seeming like I was stalking them. Is that too much to ask for?
     Secondly, there are way too many unnecessary changes to the layout itself. I had a normal cute Instagram profile until the app wanted to take a façade of “modernism.” It significantly shrunk the size of my bio. It’s also an odd grey color, no longer the vibrant white it used to be. 
     Additionally, I can no longer see the accounts that viewed my story when they’re “highlights.” There really is no reason to keep their identities hidden. 
     In conclusion, Instagram is trying to be unique but is actively adopting traits from other apps. Another horrendous example of this is when we had to “swipe” through our feed instead of scrolling.

My music randomly turned into weird music and I can no longer find, search or look up artists I've been able to look up before or had before. This has not changed for almost a week now. I've tried reinstalling the app, switching from personal to business (even tho my ig was never a business account) i go on my main account and my music options is normal, but I go on my other account and it's weird music. I know I'm not the only one dealing with this issue. Can you please fix it?
Having music on a social media platform is something major and if it not working what's the point in me using instagram. Please pay attention to the people reaching out with this problem.
Because the long it doesn't get fixed the more frustrating it's getting not being able to post things on my story with the music I want/like anymore when I could before. Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-21T06:34:09-07:00

It is a annoyance to be constantly thrown off by a random post and make me second guess if am I following this person by accident. Leave the recommendations to
explore page, since that is a place to explore for new potential followers! Or at least give an option to disable it the recommendations in feed. I just don’t get what’s the point of choosing who I want follow if I am going to be force fed people’s pages to follow anyway. This would also work better if the algorithms for suggestions also functioned as it should but sadly it can’t seem to understand what I’m truly interested in on instagram. Not really innovative, just a nuisance. I love what Instagram is at the core. A place to share memories and communicate via pictures and video, don’t lose that core just to be a copy of other social media outlets out there.

It’s interesting to see how the app & algorithm has changed over the years. And how people have changed how they use the app (ex- it started out as following friends- now it’s about growing an online following & instead of posting one pic people post several in one post & reels/ TikTok like videos) it seems like reels get the best exposure & reach outside of your followers (if you’re trying to grow your account). Stories used to be a great feature but my story reach & engagement has GREATLY diminished over the years along with my regular posts. I wish IG would push stories and posts the way they used to. 
I do like the app- I think IG is trying to stick with the times by promoting reels and the shopping feature is cool & convenient too. I think they should focus on changing how they push stories to followers & posts to non-followers- because these are two of the main elements that Instagram are known for!

Not only are you making it harder for smaller accounts and ARTISTS to gain followers, you’re also excluding thousands of users who actually want to make a name for themselves. With each and every update you’re making it harder and harder for artists in particular to reach people.
I am not going to pay another cent to have any of my posts boosted when last time I “boosted” I reached barely anyone. That is a scam, just like Facebook ad boosts!
Please for the love of god change all the options and actually make hashtags useful. The whole point of Instagram was to share PHOTOS for Christ sake, not be a stupid TikTok clone. If people want to make reels, go ahead! But excluding the whole purpose of sharing photos when that doesn’t even reach anybody anymore is stupid. Change the hashtags back, whoever made the decision for hashtags to be irrelevant is mind boggling to me. And get rid of the top recent posts option! It’s the same exact thing as top posts!

This app is perfect for spreading positivity but the only bad thing is that it’s very easy to spread hate. This obviously isn’t on the creators as they clearly meant this to be a positive platform but Instagram could at least delete or ban the users spreading hate and telling people to go kill themselves because that is wrong and no one should be treated this way of course this isn’t on the creators just the bad people in this world but if you could ban or just delete these accounts or comments that would be great! Other than that this app is perfect! It’s so amazing and if your debating getting it you should it’s amazing and everything you want it to be and better!

I’ve found that from user to user, some get access to certain features (share post to story, for example) and others do not with no apparent rhyme or reason. The ability to contact customer support is extremely lacking, so much so that I worry if I had an issue less trivial, I might need to simply delete and create another profile to find a solution.

Targeted ads are sometimes so incognito it’s not even obvious I’ve seen an ad. There’s also no way to turn this feature off or pay for the Instagram app and avoid ads altogether. Perhaps if I were paying for the service, they’d have someone available to tell me why the ability to share a post to my story goes away and comes back only to go away again and never return.

Overall, consistency in user experience is important, right? It’s why you read reviews, to get an idea of what to expect. But when my experience of the app (features available, number of ads, glitches experienced) is so vastly different than that of my friends with roughly the same number of followers, I honestly have no idea what anyone else should expect.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-04-16T11:18:09-07:00

I enjoy the new updates, especially the one where you can select music and recommend it to your  overall following.

At the same time, I don’t necessarily care for the new layout. I find that the previous layout had less bug fixes and an easier time uploading photos onto my account. Furthermore, the previous layout looked a lot more sophisticated and made it so navigating around the app was much easier. Nowadays, it seems like there’s always one bug after another. Perhaps there could be an option where you can choose between the two previous layouts? That would be nice. Some people do like the new layout and I completely understand; to each their own. At the same time, some people (especially with multiple accounts) either have one and the other layout, or they constantly get switched to the new one automatically, making bug problems much harder to handle.

Last year, when I uploaded pictures and albums, the photos were perfectly crisp and clear when I posted them. However, lately when I upload photos, the pictures become more glitchy and less clear. I did a test to see if my previous photos would still be clear if I posted them now, but alas, the previously clear pictures that I had posted turned out worse with bad quality and glitchy ness just like my recent ones. If that sounded confusing at all, please just fix the photo quality that appears after people upload photos to the app. The photo quality used to be amazing on instagram, but lately, it’s been lacking.

I care about my friends. I want to see what they’re up to and how their lives are. 

Also, Instagram is NOT a shopping app for us photo lovers. We want to share pictures and moments… we don’t want to shop. Having this shopping page tab in the main bar demonstrates that you all care more about money than your users. A better choice would be to change the bottom bar back to normal and add the shopping icon and reels icon to the top right where the notification and post buttons are. It would make more sense from a graphic design perspective. Hierarchy of importance — the main tab should consist of your post button, your Home Screen, your profile, your notifications, and your search button. Reels, shopping, and other ads-ons (such as the story button) should be on the top bar.

Its buggy and has been for a few years now. Still after going through two different Ipads the images randomly bounce between pixelated or being crystal clear. It seems to me that sometimes the images are optimized for cell phone screens, while other times they’re optimized larger for an Ipad.

If the hashtags are broken it kind of kills the best part of what Instagram does. Seriously, work on these bugs and IG would be MUCH better.

9767481431,playafisha,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id313343848,276.1,1,Zero support,"Just over a year ago my account was hacked. I no longer had control of it after over ten years. I followed every single way to contact them. I had friends report my hacked accounts. My account was private, but not after it was hacked. The hackers were posting pictures of my nephews, both under the age of ten, for their crypto scam. I followed all the suggested ways to try to reclaim my account. Pictures with my photo ID and mail and dated items. I tried contacting support through Facebook to see if I could get a connection somehow. I even emailed as many IG emails that I could find. NOT A SINGLE ACTUAL RESPONSE THAT WASN’T BOT GENERATED!! The app that brags about connecting people has zero connection to people. I was never sent any of the follow up responses other than they couldn’t identify me through my profile. Sorry I didn’t snap selfies  often enough for your automated system. I tried for a few months to recover it. And not one single bit of actual help. I honestly don’t miss the app. It was cool when I first started over a decade ago, but once Sucky Zuck took over it became instant trash. You no longer saw your friends or accounts you followed or you liked. It was a bunch of random trash that didn’t interest me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-30T04:04:34-07:00

What disappoints me is the apps lack of communication with you when you are having problems with functions within the app. Instagram has never replied to any of my many requests for help which is incredibly frustrating. Currently my activity portion of the app stopped working, almost a week ago, despite many attempts at fixing it myself it still does not work. You can be banned for a 24 hour period for commenting on a photo. For example, I have been banned for the comment “beautiful” on a picture of a flower.  I’ve only complimented photos, I  never write anything mean, rude or crude. Instagram never responds to any of my requests for help. If they could be more responsive to problems (better customer service) and didn’t censor kind comments I would give this app five stars. It is a great way to see other parts of the world, learn about  other cultures and find DIY videos.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-22T07:51:34-07:00
8760890081,homewithchris,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id109573040,238.0,2,Content creator with promotion issue since Feb.,"I have had an issue where I can’t run promotions on Instagram. I have a zero balance and in fact, I have a credit I am not able to use either that expires in August. I have submitted endless amounts of tickets with the payments team and they have charged my card to test it and it works fine. I am still unable to do promotions. All it says is that an error occurred on the IG end and I am left here helpless. Promotions are the main marketing tool I use to get followers on my page and therefore results in my direct income. I have felt like giving up since no one on the payments team has been able to help me or even answer me with how to resolve this. I keep getting error messages over and over and no matter how I try to fix it, nothing works. My card is good, I have a zero balance and I have a credit on file. But still, I am unable to do any promotions for my business and no one seems to be able to fix the issue. Makes me want to give up on my business. IG has let me down. This has been happening so be early Feb. this year. 

I pray someday someone can take the time to see the real issue going on and fix it for me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-10T11:55:50-07:00

𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙘 𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙧  so first off, my music sticker just gives me random options of ppl i have never heard of before and when i look up anybody like Ariana, Joji, Melanie, nothing shows up. i have tried everything. deleting instagram and getting it back, switching from a business account to a personal, and nothing has worked. i’m tired of seeing bald men when i tap on my music sticker.
𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙖𝙫𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙖𝙗  i save a lot of things on instagram. it’s really helpful for me. but now none of it will load. i’ve done everything you can think of and it just won’t work. for example, i have a saved tab just for memes. i can see the tab but when i press on it, it says it’s loading then after a minute of it, it says it can’t load. it makes no sense.
𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙩  it. just. gets. worst. it’s so unnecessary. the shopping tab shouldn’t even be where it is. a lotta ppl don’t even shop on insta. instagram is just getting so lazy at this point. do these ppl want us to delete the app? it’s so obvious everyone is tired of this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-18T15:22:09-07:00
2138466898,Opp29,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id281835058,29.0,5,This app gets worse and worse,"Instagram is getting worse and worse with each update. Ever since FB bought Instagram it has gone downhill. They are no longer coming up new ideas. Like Insta stories. COME ON! That is a clear pull off of Snapchat. Also with the search directory. It used to be really nice but now it is very frustrating because whenever you tap on one photo you only get related photos instead of a variety of things that interest you. Plus with the new “relevant feed” it shows stuff that is totally IRRELEVANT! I personally only see ads and horrible memes (don’t get me wrong I love memes but these are pure trash). It also will show you photos and videos from weeks ago that when you like them (not checking to see when it was posted because that is too much work, and this is a social media platform and not a job) the people you follow will get weirded out. That is at least what happens to a significant amount of people. To summarize this Instagram needs to become more original and less recycled.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-28T18:01:09-07:00
5082138505,Rokolor,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id111298647,113.0,1,New picture messaging feature needs work,"Instagram hasn't changed that much in the years I've used it but recently they've introduced a Snapchat like feature where you can send picture messages with text, basically the same thing as Snapchat. I like the Instagram system better though, because the messaging interface has a feature whereby you can incorporate someone's picture message into your reply. It appears as a little thumbnail version of the image they sent you, kind of like the little thumbnail you see when you're facetiming someone. This is really a great feature because it helps to organize the conversation and that way you can remember what is being said. Sadly the system has a really annoying bug that is seemingly completely random in its timing. The issue is pretty simple: a lot of times the text that you write on the picture doesn't appear on the other persons screen when they receive the message. So basically there is no message. This happens usually when replying and incorporating the other persons image into your own but it also happens on standalone messages. Very very annoying and has killed many conversations. I really hope this gets fixed because if it does I'll pretty much ditch Snapchat altogether.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-03T16:27:42-07:00

Plus I don’t know if u thought not being able to tell how many post there are is important but believe me it’s important. PLUS I can tell u still ain’t put the the home page stuff in chronological order like mad people haven’t been asking for it u really need to step up ur game and listen to the requests that people are telling u because a review is here for a reason and doing updates and fixing things no one asked to be fixed is a joke when there are mad thing wrong that u have yet to take in to consideration and fix maybe if u listened Instagram would be better you don’t want ur ratings to go down like Snapchat .( Ok  that’s all I had to say but unknown fix my stuff back to how it was and just know I’m being generous with them two stars),https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-01T21:05:27-07:00
