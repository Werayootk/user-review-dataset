Features that were once freely available are now behind a paywall, and the app is inundated with ads. The ad formats are frequently updated, seemingly to increase the likelihood of accidental clicks. The app's push for data collection via the share feature over screenshots is concerning. Additionally, ads disrupt the flow of posts and comments, complicating the screenshotting process. A recent change to the app icon, which many find unappealing, coupled with the original icon being paywalled, adds to the frustration. The removal of the previous badge system has invalidated the efforts of users who had earned paid credits. Lastly, the app's changes to APIs have detrimentally impacted third-party applications, leaving users with fewer choices and a diminished overall experience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-06T12:14:13-07:00

However, I am disappointed with the performance issues that have plagued the app lately, making it borderline unusable.

Despite having a stable internet connection and Reddit servers being functional, the app frequently encounters issues with loading and displaying basic content. This is particularly frustrating as Reddit is one of the largest online platforms with millions of users who rely on it for news, entertainment, and interaction with various communities.

While the app's interface remains user-friendly and visually appealing, the frequent performance issues negate any positive aspects of the app. It is disheartening to see an app for such a significant platform fail to deliver a smooth and seamless experience to its users.

5378442426,JackSama.exe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1019321824,4.49.0,4,All About the Community,"Reddit is such a great app because it relies on its community for all of its content, and there are so many subreddits (or smaller communities) to choose from so you can find out where you fit into it all. This definitely can be a downside, as you will come across arguments left and right on Reddit, but it‚Äôs just human nature.
 
 Plus, you tend to see less of these arguments when you find communities that have similar interests as everyone tends to be on the same page. For example, r/entitledparents is a subreddit about parents who are overly entitled to themselves or their children to a point where they act like fools sometimes. The community on this subreddit almost never argues on the side of the EP (entitled parent) because the community is specifically against that side of the argument.

 I would recommend Reddit to all people seeking not only ways to find people who you can relate to, but people who are seeking more confidence. As you post more often, you become more confident in what you post and put more reasoning behind your comments. Sometimes that confidence can earn you awards from other users!

Recipes, funny gifs, racism, sappy videos, IT support, porn, funny dogs, political vitriol, travel advice, etc.  You name it, there are people making that content and moderating it for Reddit, for free.

You may like some of that and you may never want to see some of that.  This app does a really poor job of letting you filter what you do and don‚Äôt see.  You can only view subreddits you subscribe to but you can‚Äôt easily filter content you don‚Äôt want to see.

Other apps were great at that but Reddit has chosen to shut down the ability for 3rd party apps to bring that functionality.

In turn, Reddit has not brought that functionality to their own app.

So where I used to take a break at work and scroll Reddit without fear of seeing porn, people getting killed, or hateful political content, I can no longer do that.  Which means I can no longer use Reddit.

There are many other issues that this move by Reddit causes people with disabilities and people who moderate Reddit for free but Reddit has been explicitly clear in their published responses that they don‚Äôt care about that.  That‚Äôs not an inference I‚Äôm making - it‚Äôs their literal words.

Or they offer some new features and never flesh them out or make them easy to use. As of right now this app is a joke with no punchline.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2022-02-28T12:01:00-07:00

I been on app for idk 7-8y now and while some updates were terrible this one tops them all. Like who gave you idea to auto play and scroll comments at same time like just think about it. If I watched a video and now I want to see comments I normally start scrolling now video stays up and commenting section is smaller because of it. Like come on now this isn‚Äôt app where you watch videos for that you have Insta reels Tiktok YT. I mean come on you really messed this one up. When fixed I‚Äôll revoke my review or at least give option to be able to scroll full page with video being gone when going to commenting section. Anyways, until then I switch to other Reddit app because one you have rn is just pure non sense made for 13y olds.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-12T09:08:55-07:00
