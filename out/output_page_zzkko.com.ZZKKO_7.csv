but unlike romwe, u guys actually make good quality clothing at amazingly low prices. 
one thing i dont like, is that sometimes clothes will come in the mail not being sewn in some parts, or having imperfections like rips or small things that arent it- butttt if i were to return it it would be super fast!!
when i return something from SHEIN, the process goes very quick and i get my money back fast, which i love love love
but yeah, theres some other things that they need to get better with like sometimes the items might be low quality or not last very long, but overall very good job sheinnn",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-10T09:44:47-07:00

I've ordered quite a few things from there and most I'd say I do end up sending back, but what I've kept I like very much and it's super CHEAP! Shipping (to U.S.) does take forever so if you are ordering for a specific occasion definitely order a few weeks ahead of time and don't always expect for it to be exactly what you imagined it would be. So if your ordering like a dress for a wedding or something and you get it just in the nick of time I'd definitely have s back up outfit plan just in case it doesn't fit or look like in the picture. I like that you can get points for reviewing and uploading pictures of their clothes and use those towards future purchases.

I will say that the quality of the material is not always the highest but it is pretty average for the most part. There are almost always coupon codes that you can use to save money and on top of that you can earn points and use that towards your purchase! One thing I will say is ALWAYS read the reviews because they will often include pictures of everyday people wearing the clothes and on top of that they often list their size and measurements so you will know how it fits and if you should size up or down. Only annoyance is that every time I open the app I have to wait like 15 seconds for an ad to be over before I can actually use the app and it gets kind of annoying.

You have to be smart, check the sizing chart, look at customer reviews on the items and be rational. Most of the items run a little bit small. It depends what you’re picking out. I am a size small in most tops, usually a medium (4-6) in bottoms. I almost always order one size up on each. I’ve probably made about 8 shipments at this point from them, and I’ve found something to be unwearable only when I’ve gotten the wrong size maybe twice. There are VERY few things I didn’t like on me, or things that were too small that I either returned (easy) or gave to a friend. You get what you pay for. But this is a great way to sample so many different styles for every season without emptying your wallet. Shipping has been updated and it’s also faster these days.

They have almost everything I need (about 95% of it), with the exception of liquid items, like glue & epoxy resin—though, they DO have a ton of amazing resin Molds! 😍
And the BEST part, is that everything is very affordable! 
They also do a LOT of promotions/sales (they have sales on items, Free Shipping promos or BOTH like every single day), so you can save even MORE on your purchases. 
I tend to wait until I can afford to make a bigger purchase during a sale on the items, so I can take advantage of those PLUS Free shipping, and it really pays off. 
There have been *very few* items that I haven’t been super pleased with (but not in a major way, by any means) and I’ve ordered a LOT of stuff though then! But even if you’re not entirely happy with an item, it’s so inexpensive that it’s not a big issue. Though, they do offer a FREE return the first time you do one (I personally haven’t felt the need to return anything yet). 
If you’re into ANY type of Craft, do nail art as a profession or hobby, or just love shipping good deals on clothing, accessories, shoes, etc. (for ANY gender/age!) then you’ve found the RIGHT app! 😍♥️😍♥️

When I talked to the representative from Shein, they said that I need to coordinate it with USPS?! how am i supposed to work on that? They are basically throwing me back and forth with no solution. How come domestic delivery could be this troublesome? And why can’t shein just put the label on the package to tell them to let the customer to pick up if something is wrong with the address? (which is not the case here, i have ordered countless things online and never had any problem until i ordered stuff from shein). It’s a lot easier and makes more sense.

They also have a whole bunch of other stuff. They even have home decor. One major thing I will say though about the clothes is that you HAVE TO CHECK THE MEASUREMENTS. For example, something might be a medium, but the bust is 28in. Also, check the reviews ofc, to see what other people say. Sometimes it runs large, small, etc. Sometimes it’s a little thinner or more cropped than expected. They have a size thing that you can do (if you can’t find it on the app just look it up) and it will show you your likely sizes based on your measurements and your size compared to other brands. Then, it will tell you specifically what your size most likely is.

The clothes are quality, from dresses to pants or skirts to jackets or simple T-shirts to blouses, they haven’t failed me on the quality or the price. They almost always have a sale too!

Everyone at my job (small office - mostly women) know exactly who to come to when they need a dress or an outfit for something upcoming - I have been dubbed the outlet and I’m proud of it.

As for returning the items, my printer died so I have to find another way to return some of my items.i don’t have a label. I did mention this to them, but with customer service not understanding English, you get the run around. Also I mentioned to people who want to order from them, make sure you pay the .99 fee. If you don’t, you could get the wrong items, size or it’ll never get delivered. So recently most of my items have been the wrong size bad quality and looks nothing like the picture.

Little girls should not be wearing plunge swimsuits 😒 Now some of their clothing is cute! They have plenty of cute vintage basics that are under 10 bucks. I just don’t love some of their other pieces. My favorite thing about SHEIN is their accessories. Jaw clips, bucket hats, anti blue light glasses, and jewelry all usually under 10 bucks! I can’t get enough of them! The app also works really well, you can get points pretty easy and use them to take a couple bucks off your order. You can also enter into competitions and make outfits.

This is a Chinese wholesale website however the clothing is very well made. The sizing is set up for US sizes so you don’t have to worry about something being too small. Furthermore, if someone does run small, the reviews will tell you and there’s a chart that says it runs small. Shein motivates customers to write detailed reviews in exchange for points that can be used as discounts. Similarly, the clothing items are SOO unique and cuter than anything else I would find in a local store. The shipping takes a little long but then again, if I don’t have to pay for shipping then I don’t mind. If you want quicker shipping, choose express (beggars can’t be choosers).

Overall, I’ve loved the styles, prices and quality of the things I’ve chosen. I’m usually very picky about fabric quality, but just by seeing pictures of some of the items you can tell what they’ll be like irl. For me, the biggest plus is that they have very ample size selections in all styles. I think SHEIN is one of the best options for plus size clothing, and styles are either the same as those offered for standard sizes or completely unique pieces. 

I have had to return a few items because I didn’t like the fabric quality, but I haven’t had a single item look different than the pictures in the app of what I ordered. Jeans on this site are AMAZING, thick denim with quality stitching. I also love the dresses and jackets. Like I said, I can pick out quality a bit easily since I’m familiar with fabric and know what I’ll look like, so I def see some items on the site that would not fit my quality standards. Also, user reviews are critical in choosing items, since they give insight as to sizing, fit, quality and overall style.

Shein offered to give me fifty shein points and a refund which was nice except that I spent over 200 shein points on that sweater and a coupon.

And, things go out of stock incredibly quickly. If you bought one size and it didn’t fit, don’t expect to be able to buy a different size of the same dress a week later. 
And, I realize this doesn’t bother everyone, but it bothers me so I’ll mention it: the grammar is atrocious to the point where some things don’t even make sense. It doesn’t cost that much to hire an editor to make sure your website and customer service communications look professional, and the lack of attention to detail/accuracy feed into my expectation of low quality. 

Now for the clothing review: in addition to buying some, myself, I examined a TON of Shein clothes back when I worked for a thrift store. They scream “poor quality.” However nice it looks in photos, be prepared for it to be thin and semi-rough-feeling fabric; half the items need a slip in order to be wearable in public. One dress I received had a seam coming apart right in front.
They run true to size unless you have a small bust or narrow shoulders, in which case anything off-the-shoulder may not stay up.

9783877976,Abeauty28,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id321452317,9.0.9,1,Items Never Delivered and Refund was not given,Used to like shein the only reason I did a haul was because everything came at once. First time since being a customer they decided to switch shipping vendors and my items came in 3 packages. Received the first which was small my jacket in my mailbox. The second said it was signed but never delivered so I began a dispute. They refunded me for two dresses and then the same happened with the 3rd which had 3 more dresses. Went to dispute those items never received and they said they would check with the shipping distributor and but emailed me saying it was delivered… how?????? I didn’t even get the second package how did the 3rd deliver? I requested they resend the items over a refund since those dresses for for work.  They stopped responding to my inquiry and I’m even more frustrated about that. I’m deleting the app and will shop online elsewhere going forward. I also plan to make a report to the BBB because I see this is the same issues other customers are having.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-03T15:33:29-07:00
