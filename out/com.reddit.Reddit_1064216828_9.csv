10986804184,Vladdie498,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id41392863,2024.08.1,4,Shop crashes consistently,"App is good. Good enough that I use it enough that I was finally ready to say sure, fine, I‚Äôll buy an avatar. It‚Äôs too bad that when I try to browse the shop I find that it consistently crashes the app on me and boots me back to the iPhone Home Screen. I did make sure to update to the most recent version (as of 2/27/24) but I run into the same bug:

When I am using the shop and scrolling on the browse all avatar collectibles, it seems once you have scrolled down far enough, it will begin to glitch and sometimes all the avatar options will all slide over one. You can still scroll up and down and they seem to load just fine but when you try and select any of the avatars individually, instant crash.

Hope this is fixed otherwise you probably won‚Äôt get any money from me to buy an avatar if I can‚Äôt properly browse the shop without it crashing. 

Either way thanks for your continued development of this app and reading my rant.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-27T15:33:40-07:00
