Got to the hotel. The person at the desk said I had no reservation so I went to bing.com called and they said I had no reservation. Finally the person at the desk said it was booked through an out of the country agency. There was no contact information no name. I was totally in the dark tired from travel. I looked at the room. It was supposed to be a room with two beds it had one bed and one pullout, small, rickety sofa. I asked if I could have a larger room they said I could but it was on the second floor with no elevator I am a senior and my niece with me is 63 we did not want to go up and down steep stairs.
We ask if we could have a refund and they said it would have to be made through booking.com. booking.com did not give me any information as to how or when I could get a refund

Unfortunately the lists only work as a pop out, which is not great when viewing the list and particular bad when switching to map view. Trying to navigate the map and look at properties and photos while the app only uses, at most, 20% of my screen, is not a great experience.

Makes comparison shopping like “pin the tail on the donkey.”  App features completely useless “sort by price” feature which sorts by the base price per night, but doesn’t include taxes and fees (that, in the case of a short trip, often more than double the price once you click “reserve”…but aren’t uniform across properties). So it’s never actually sorting by final price. 

We used this app extensively during a long trip in Europe and loved it.  I suspect European laws don’t let them hide the final price like they do here in the US. Not sure why anyone keeps using it—do they not notice or care that the supposed total price went up by $300 when they clicked “reserve “?

I tried to provide feedback directly to booking.com, but their “contact us” mechanism is only for issues with particular bookings so it sort of short-circuited (they responded to my feedback asking for a reservation number; I said I didn’t have one and was just providing feedback, and they responded to that asking me to contact the property directly), reinforcing my resolve to never use them again (in the US at any rate).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-06T19:39:02-07:00
