It’s taken me to the app to put my email password and then asked me for the number it gives me and blocked the number with that same question making me guess from 01 to 99. 

It scans my face too soon and never gets it right so I had to disable that feature

I wish it had the option to auto authenticate for certain apps or websites. I don’t think college should have two brick walls in front of it. 

There’s at least the feeling of safety even though it seems that it’s extremely low risk for college.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-06T10:27:45-07:00

Because now my watch can no longer approve that it me trying to access my work. I swear my work grooves on trying to make it so difficult to login.. 
I will delete this app and have it go back to calling me on my cell phone and hit “#” to access my work. Much faster and easier than open app, most times log into app, approve connection, wait, approved.

I really enjoyed the feature of using Apple Watch to do 2-factor verifying and it was really convenient, thanks to your hard work.

Now the accounts do not appear properly unless the font size is decreased - this of course leads those with visual difficulties are not able to use other applications properly because the fonts are too small to see the content.
