Now, every time I attempt to login it pulls up the authentication app I receive an error stating my sign in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource. I do not know what this means but the issue is I can no access my work email. I’m hoping this a software update bug that will be resolved soon. You cannot access this right now Your sign-in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource. For example, you might be signing in from a browser, app, or location that is restricted by your admin. I recently found out from a colleague that my company’s IT people purposely restricted our access to check email outside of work for security reasons. It isn’t a software bug but was done by design. Prior to this change the app seemed to function normally.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-01T09:24:09-07:00

10858745413,Iamgpop1,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id488387625,6.8.3,3,I like the convenience BUT,I switched to a new iPhone and it has been a bear. Granted I could have searched YouTube for help but wanted to see how intuitive it was to figure out what I was doing wrong. A short script when installing/transferring on new phone would be great. It just so happened I did not factory reset my new phone. A short dialog like “Is this a new device”. And then go on to say “you will need to restore backup from old device registration first”. Something like that,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-24T06:22:38-07:00
