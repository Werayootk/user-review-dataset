10946129835,dubat,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id404835697,5.60.0,5,Excellent for seeing spending across cards,"Monzo is a super helpful bank and way to manage your money overall.

It’s really easy to link multiple credit cards and set a target for my monthly spending that takes into account all my credit cards plus my debit card.

Also, separating your balance into several smaller sub-accounts (“pots”) that you can name is surprisingly useful, and setting up specific merchants to spend from certain pots makes it a lot easier to stay on top of my budget.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-16T11:48:38-07:00

10860731503,Blakedd,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id263032063,5.57.0,5,Update to my account being frozen,Previously I posted a review of Monzo when they had frozen my account with all my money in it and no response. A few hours later I reached the UK Monzo who explained it was under review and they would let me know when they are done. Well ir suddenly hit me It's because I founded my account with my other banks debit card for $2k and my account less than a month ago. But they couldn't confirm if it's what caused my account being reviewed. So I sent them a picture of the debit card I used to pay with and my driver's license. Less than one hour later my account was unfroze. NOW I LOVE MONZO! and the fact I can add funds from my other debit cards (only mine) much easier to move funds quickly when I'm traveling to avoid the foreign transaction fees and Monzo works worldview no foreign transaction fees. Plus they can be linked to your banks via plaid. Thanks Monzo for changing my mind completely about your bank,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-24T18:45:01-07:00

10118825438,Anonymous veriewer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id458250105,5.31.0,3,Can't add to second apple pay wallet? Logs out other devices,I originally downloaded this onto my ipad to save space on my phone (200+MB) but later learned that ipad has a separate apple pay wallet so adding there doesn't put the card on my phone wallet. So I deleted that and installed on the iphone but now every time I click to add to apple pay it briefly shows an error message and then goes back to the screen before I clicked to add. Meanwhile it logged me out of the ipad and I have to log back in there too try to add back to ipad wallet. But can't add to ipad wallet either. Like the option has been removed after one use. Maybe it takes a few days to refresh. Still annoying.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-08T15:29:13-07:00
