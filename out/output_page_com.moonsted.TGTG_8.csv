There was dill and collard greens and brussels sprouts and a large cookie and parsley and grapes. I was so happy with everything that was in there. It was the best experience.

I adore this app, what it stands for and of course what it offers. Not only is it fun to browse around what restaurants are offering what products, but it‚Äôs also really easy to use. This is an app I‚Äôve been looking for. Kudos!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-15T16:32:07-07:00

Now it‚Äôs gone entirely and makes map view absolutely unusable. I have to click on so many random gray bubbles just to get to a green bubble nearby.

Not many dinner options, unless you want sides? I‚Äôd prefer going to food banks than this. 2 stars for the app idea but I‚Äôd give it 1 star for food options.

The benefit to me personally is that we get healthy foods at greatly discounted prices while we help our local restaurants/food stores eliminate food wastage by selling leftovers at a discount.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-10T13:00:38-07:00

When I arrived, the restaurant cancelled the order just as the pickup window opened. What a waste of my time and gas! I had no means of reviewing the order after their cancellation, which means that the restaurant‚Äôs great reviews exclude these frustrating and expensive experiences. There are very few restaurants on the app in my area, so you end up really dredging the bottom of the barrel.
