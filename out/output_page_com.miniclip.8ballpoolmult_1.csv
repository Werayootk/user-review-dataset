The developers did an exceptional job and gameplay is very enjoyable. I have really improved in my skill level. Bugs or errors are very minimal; I do think after playing for some months that when you have lots  money, shots that are lined up right to the pocket sometimes do not go in. The spin prizes are not randomized too well. The miscellaneous cues I have so many and I never use them and/or would have to spend an excessive amount of money to get them upgraded to be useful. Two major gripes are that you have to pay to practice. It would be very helpful to be able to place the balls in certain spots to practice shots or have the game perform a shots in different areas and then you can practice them; that would be fair to charge for. Some cues cannot be upgraded at will by using coins. You need to spawns and spend and hope the box provides an upgrade to the cue you want it for. The piggy bank rates are excessive. Please make rough patch and the slippery board and the random breakshot part of the regular boards that can be played. It was really great diversity added to the games. It would be a great segway between Tokyo and the really high entry fee games. All in all a beautiful job in doing the games with the graphics, the boards and the varying textures of the pool tables.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-30T06:14:52-07:00

However right now this game is unplayable. You can’t play 2 games in a row in either Berlin or Mumbai without playing a low level account that is cheating. My account once had 11 billion coins, I got in trouble for losing on purpose to a friend to give them coins about 4-5 years ago and had all the coins taken out of my acc and I just recently got back into the game and built up to 700 million coins and I’ve dropped down to 300 million due to losing every other game and consecutive games to cheaters. I love this game and have broken a phone over it before and logging in to lose to a person who doesn’t even try to play the game in back-to-back-to-back-to back games makes me want to give up on this game. Winning percentage is just dropping and there’s nothing I can do to help it. I hope something happens to make this stop happening or to make it a rare occurance, like back awhile ago when I would see a cheater I wouldn’t even care about losing to them because hey it’s just one game and it’s not something you barely see, but right now it’s just miserable and turning an amazing game into just a depressing shell of what it could/should/used to be. Sincerely hope it gets better!

You will scratch when you shouldn’t and the cue ball will end up places on the table it shouldn’t leaving your with no shot. Also, I’ve played this game off and on for a long time. I spent a good amount of money on it years ago. I had all of the best clubs unlocked. I never had an issue restoring my purchases in the past. Now for some reason they are saying I can’t get my stuff back. That makes no sense. I did spend a dollar and got a decent stick that came with coins and cash. That stick is no better than the original one with no stats. I made more balls on the break with that plain stick than I do with the one I bought. This game could be a lot of fun and one I’d play for a long time, but just like all apps with in app purchases, it is sketchy. I will never believe that any of these games are legit. They manipulate the outcome to try to make you spend compulsively. I know at the end of the day it’s our decision, but people get aggravated then spend just to get back at those that win or because we are so aggravated spending will give us an advantage. 8 Ball Pool, Golf Rival and Zynga Poker are so sketchy. All are fun, but I’ll never believe they do not cheat. Especially if you spend money. That’s how they hook you. You’ll notice little things change, you’ll miss what should go in and whatever else.

In fact, have never paid a cent to play this game. That said, it’s become very evident that the vast majority of games you play are fixed. Skill is such a minor determining factor of who actually wins or loses for a material number of your games, and it’s only gotten worse over time. Over the last twelve games I’ve played, you can clearly tell that four have been computers, who all get to break and have a 100% chance of clearing the table before you have a shot. In other words, if you assume you have a zero percent chance of winning 33% of your games, you can max out at 67%. Since I win 65% of my games, I effectively beat 90+% of human opponents. That said, it is very frustrating to have to take a step back in coins every so often because of the number of bots you play. If the developers want to improve the game, it should be completely human interaction. I don’t take offense when I lose to a human player, but is very frustrating to lose millions of coins to a robot. When it happens 1 out of every 3 games, the frustration is amplified. For people who pay money to play, please heed my words that you’re wasting your time and money. Hone your skills and play for free as I do. In conclusion, if the number of bots continue to increase, my time playing this game will soon reach its end.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-08T11:33:37-07:00

It’s quite obvious when someone lines up one of the most difficult shots you’ve seen over years and years of playing. I know of a few jailbroken editions of this game that provide a line extension so you can see where every single ball will go. Not being able to report these players just makes it so they can win time after time. Second, all breaks are supposed to be simulated and never the same as the last. 90% of the time in 9 ball, unless I break, I lose on that break. It doesn’t take much skill to use a specific break that works every single time. I’ve played for WELL over 10 years (before it even touched IOS and was only available on the miniclip website). The cheating issue and 9 ball issue are at an all time high now and I’m quite tired of it. I’ll get to 100k, 200k, whatever and then lose game after game due to the specific break. There’s also an issue in 8 ball where the ball can bounce off the back of the pocket or even go THROUGH the pocket! I’ve had this happen a few times and you quite literally can’t win unless the opponent puts in the 8 ball early. I’ve played for years because there haven’t been issues until recently. The game also turned to p2w (game pass) which is disgusting to me. “Oh you can get 5 scratchers for $2.99 or you can give us $5 and get the scratchers and a million other things, EVERY MONTH!” Fix the game that I used to love, PLEASE!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-17T18:35:54-07:00

However, the part that’s very frustrating is when you make a ball you’re supposed to make and the game tells you didn’t make the right ball. For instance, if I call the four in the corner and I make the four in the corner and the game will say I didn’t make the ball where I said I would after I did make the ball where I said I would. Then it will give the other player a turn when it’s not really their turn. Honesty is always the best policy so it’s very frustrating when a computerized game will not do what it is supposed to do. It makes me think that if I don’t pay money to play the game, then it won’t work right. I love pool and I have played it since I was very young so I understand English and a lot about the game. I appreciate getting to play the game, but it is very offensive when it does not do what it supposed to do as is if I’m lying. it says if another human is watching the game and then will make it cheat you. Thank you for making it so I can play the pool game on the phone and I play it a lot. I just want it to be honest all the time. Have a nice day and thanks for letting me put in my input. Tell me if there’s a way that I can make it quit doing that or if it’s just because I’m not paying money to do it.

First off, thanks for making it entertaining enough that I want to spend 5.00 for the pool pass. So many game programmers developed a game and just expect that the players will put out cash just because. Something I really hate... But I do have a small complaint about your game. Let’s say I’m in the middle of a 5000 game of 9 ball. A friend comes online and challenged me. I leave the game I’m playing and the matchup just keeps spinning with no connection to my friend. This is extremely irritating because the matchup never works. It cannot be that hard to make it work. Especially if the friend is right here in the U.S. I’m matched up with complete strangers from all over the world, but cannot get hooked up with a friend that is in another state..... Please fix this. And then my review will change to 5 stars. Until that time, 4 is the best I can give. Thank you.

Hello, I paid for the pool pass, and was going to collect this morning but my prize money isn’t available. It’s just showing that the next pool pass starts in 68 hours.

It’s a pay to win game where you can only get so far without paying. When playing it, you will notice that all of the high level players are the ones that waste their money on it. Now I’m not just saying this because I am mad that I lost. I was good at it, but I felt the need to let you know the whole thing is rigged, even the players you’re matched up with. I am glad I deleted this. It’s a huge waste of time and the developers only care about making money and getting you addicted, obviously. I am happy that I spent $0 on this game and got rid of it. I played the game a couple times a day, but it’s addictive nature is easy to see. I can see how it would be easy to get addicted to it.

One problem is it doesn’t match you with players in your “ranking or experience”. A beginner may end up with an opponent that has been classified as a pro or better, depending on how long they’ve been playing. Also too many interruptions when playing with challenger banners or wanting you to challenge your FB friends. The cue stick charges don’t last through a game if you have a bad break then you may have to recharge more than once for consistent shots and that’s in addition to placing a bet. The balls sometimes can hang half over a pocket to drop then it jolts back towards the table, but the cue can too often roll with ease for a scratch. It’s just a bit fishy when you AND your opponents ball should have dropped but jolts back from the hole. There are a few more minor issues that are annoying like not being able to type your own text for chat. I’d rather it was emojis than some of the stupid pretext messages and then you have to buy more if you want to add some. Shows a lot of greed. Plus it’s anybody’s guess as to who is going to break.

If these stupid looking cues were made in real life you would not be able to play with them. Speaking of cues, unlocking them to get points, also depends on what city you play in, takes forever. Those boxes are random and stupid. And also as you progress you unlock cues, and then your stuck with them. I have over 20 cues i dont use,  i should be able to sell them for in game money. The touch is so sensitive too. There have been many times im scrolling through the cities and it clicks the wrong ones. Also there have been many times when moving and aiming the cue stick and it hits the ball. The accuracy of hitting the cue ball and putting english on it is way off.

I mean just one, the other players, (which some are the computer posing as real people) can run the whole table without you getting another shot AT ALL. Then you lose your coins and get kicked back to a lower level. The cycle repeats itself until you are scrambling to win your money back to compete in higher levels. Once you start getting close, your shots start to get off and your aim isn’t accurate (I literally screen recorded me playing and witnessed on the  slow mo playback that even tho my aim was right, the computer made me miss the shot). Then you have to spend more coins to recharge your stick. They then give you spins and free coins, 100 to 300 coins a pop to keep you playing. After realizing you can’t beat the game, you go ahead and spend money to purchase more coins to play at higher levels, the cycle goes on and on until next thing you know, you’re back at no coins and either have to play at the lower stages or pay again to temporarily play at the higher ones.

If you tap on a profile during this event, you will see the message “updating.” When this happens and it finishes its update, you could potentially be losing time leaving you no time to aim and shoot causing you to lose your turn. This has often caused players to lose the game & money if you pay for any additional coins. It makes it appear that your connection is slow but in reality the games’ network is overburdened.  This is happening more frequently than when I first started playing. There are other minor issues which aren’t worth mentioning. But the so called “slow connection” issue is the worst and why I keep rating it with 3 stars.

UPDATE: After reading some other reviews, I agree that there are bots especially when chat comments like Never Give Up are used when it makes no sense. I agree with seems that most players are in countries other than my own and skill levels not matched. I agree that it cheats you out of money and algorithyms used seem to cause you to lose.

The bug is the chat order is not always saved. I have had numerous times that I see “updating” and then the chat order is lost, including some of the messages that I hid are no longer hidden. The most annoying thing I would like to see changed is the very annoying notifications that pop up during the game. There should be a setting to allow notifications always, only when not playing a game, or never. It would also be nice to have more proper language support. If my language is set to English and I’m playing someone that has their language set to Spanish, messages I send from my chat packs should display on my opponent’s device in Spanish and messages my opponent sends should display on my device in English. Cheaters have recently become a major nuisance, probably not the first time.

Idk how I went from 113,000 coins to 37,000…I played maybe 4 games of 9 ball 100 coin bet and than I see my coin value go down to 27,000 (mind boggling). I would never spend money on this app for coins if they just disappear, I don’t get it. I still can’t wrap my head around it, I love playing pool but this is ridiculous. Btw I did all the logout than log back in stuff but to no avail of course.

Update: I figured out where the coins was going it was the recharging of the cue stick smh if you don’t want to be charged with recharging cues than use the basic cue stick. So that’s why I’m using for now, which means I am playing at a disadvantage (the fancier cue stick that have more power, aim, etc needs recharging a lot  and some take a lot of coins smh) but I don’t mind because I like the challenge. I love the game and the graphics and feel of the game here is top notch, the only drawback is occasionally you lose games because ppl have better cue sticks and don’t miss no matter how bad they aim lol that’s the only flaw",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-11T06:31:12-07:00

Additionally, the gameplay itself is entertaining as you get to play with other people around the world, and as you play you can unlock new cities as well as prizes and coins for winning. There are events in this game that run weekly, offering additional opportunities for prizes for players to win. There are even special mini games for players, such as a daily “Lucky Shot” and the ability to spin a wheel for prizes. And while there are numerous prizes available, the game remains challenging enough in that you may lose some of your earnings if you lose against an opponent.

Overall, it’s a game worth playing!

You could win 20 games in a row in Las Vegas (10,000 buy-in) if you tried but as soon as you move beyond that, you’ll see that you’ll get a lot more “guest” player opponents. They will somehow hit the most impossible sloppy shots, always the perfect amount of power to line up their next shot and you won’t even get a chance to play. Now I know there are players who are just that good with a lot of time into the game... but I ran an algorithm on recorded game play based on the odds of winning with diff buy in amounts and a 2nd based on odds of winning (same buy ins)after making in game purchases - both with all shots made at full power for the baseline. Out of the 20 matches I did for each analysis, I’ve concluded that you’re approx 15-35% (depending on the price of the IGP and or quantity) more likely to win after making an in game purchase. Strictly playing without purchases at full power, the farther you progress in buy-in price, the game will shuffle through a few ways of how it reacts to your shots.  You could attempt the same shot(Same angle too) 3 times and each time it would be different. If you read this far, do what you will with the info. That concludes my findings.

But then on another note, you got someone who is a skill level 16 (like me) playing up against a skill level 131 or even higher. (I have seen on the world leaderboard someone with a skill level of 972) Which can seem pretty unfair, but winning against them is not impossible, but it is really hard. I do like most of the concepts in the game. The fact that you can get a huge amount of cues in your collection is pretty sweet. With more cues, you have a ton of different advantages. And the general designs of some of the cues are really nice. When it comes to the games themselves, they are pretty simple, but you do have to make sure you aim correctly. Because sometimes when it seems like you have a perfect aim, it could actually go a bit lower or a bit higher than what you think, so just keep note of that.

You close it. Another pops up. Is that not what the message center and mailbox is for?

I’ve had enough of the ads and micro transactions marketing where you’re forced to see it and realize you have to spend money to get past a certain point.

Like a previous reviewer said, it’s not hackers, but miniclip’s own bots doing the burglary. There are an incredibly nauseating amount of cheat bots that make ZERO pretenses about being a bot. Especially in the highest level games. Take 10M 9 ball for example. You’re up against an opponent that has won 256 out of 300 games, with 9 BILLION in winnings. I’m sorry, there isn’t a soul out there that can win at that high of a percentage, since roughly half the games aren’t even in your own “control”. You’re gonna get the table run on you A LOT. There’s no way to have a winning percentage over 60% if you’re playing all high tables, let alone 85-90%. Then these mofos don’t even aim, hit the lowest ball on the table and make four bumper bounces to hit three different balls to get the nine ball to go softly into the pocket. If that happened once, I could chalk it up to luck. But it’s been happening EVERY OTHER GAME!!! They’re just there to rob you of 10M and you’re absolutely helpless to do anything about it, cuz even if you do get the break, the game sooooo easily just makes you scratch or otherwise puts you behind another ball with no possible angle to hit the lowest one.

However, I gave it a 1 in hopes this encourages the programmers to fix the way the game works. 1) I keep getting pop ups and stuff to login to my FB account. If I don’t have a FB account then it’s annoying so I think that should be an option. When I do login then it’s like it starts over. Whatever money I had recently doesn’t transfer. And Vice versa. One time I logged in and I actually paid for some coins. I got a new phone and everything was gone because it logged me out. When I logged back in the coins weren’t how it was before. That’s ok because it was my mistake to login in the first place but also what’s the point of logging in when we can’t change our profile name or insert our own picture? We can’t do it as a guest so you would think we could do it while signed in.
2) another major issue is during one of the contest, it says we pay an entry fee of $5K and get $10K if we win so a totally profit of $5K. However, I noticed that it only gave us $9K so a profit of $4K. Why is that? 
3) it’s hard to file a complaint. It’s hard to contact anyone.

Started winning, got up to about 1.2M in coins, then that tapered off really quick. Started with a 67%+ win rate and had a streak of about 10+ losses, all by a sliver (ex. Final ball is placed in a way where I will scratch if I attempt it, my ball miraculously ends up behind another or has another ball impacting my next shot, OR, and this is my favorite, I hit the ball and no matter how much backspin I put on it, still rolls right into the pocket with the 8 ball). 

I didn’t believe the whole bots thing until recently, and now it’s abundantly clear because I have no idea how I always clear a table, then the bot has free range to the table and never scratches, even when they bounce off 3-4 walls (if I did that, it’s 100% gonna scratch)

Most likely going to delete this game or only play the “practice” for general amusement from time to time. But when the coins run out, I’m gone. Also, let it be known that I went from 1.2M coins to about 20k almost over night. It was that bad of a freak losing streak. Like, unnervingly sus. Sketchy game.

First the good...great graphics, lots of choices of play, and you are able to upgrade cues fairly quickly if you play a lot.  Now the bad...it seems it is sometimes predetermined who the computer wants to win the game.  I have — on many, many occasions — been down to my last ball (or two) after running the table.  I will hit the next shot in the pocket only to have the computer suspiciously make my ball roll farther than it normally would have and to place it in a position which I cannot finish the game.  At first, I thought it was just me.  But after many an experiment with using the exact amount of power to roll the ball towards the end of the game, I have found it is very consistently inconsistent towards the conclusion.  It is almost that the computer algorithm wants to make it exciting towards the finish line.  I DO NOT like games which the computer determines outcomes.

By this I mean their timer will run out and it will be a good 10 seconds before the line randomly moves and they shoot instantly and get a ball somehow around three of your balls. Sometimes you’ll hit a ball and it will hover in the pocket but doesn’t fall. The following shot, the cue ball doesn’t hit the ball at all but the ball falls.

I also have a gripe with having to scroll to the lower level tables every time I want to play. I have to flip past 7 higher level tables that I’ve unlocked and can’t afford to play on every time I want to play a game. It also doesn’t cost much but it costs money to even play off line by yourself. It’s really obnoxious. It’s always trying to get $5-$15! From me for pool cues and coins.

Great game, just don’t spend any money on it, and don’t expect consistency. I know I’m not the only one, this has started happening to actual friends that play this game.  I will also add that the spins and scratch offs are rigged. Out of over 100 spins, there were only 4 spins that I won over $500. The scratch offs are the same way, they are a waste of money.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-31T07:17:21-07:00

I have lost so many coins from this. And how it seems rigged and when i have earned millions of coins and then when i look at my score in the club, most of my coins are gone and i never get them back. Seems like lots of hackers. Its hard to ever get ahead. And you never win anything on the wheel. Its rigged too. And the scratchers are low ball all the time.  We should be able to win high amounts of coins because its so hard to ever have enough to play higher stakes. And it doesn’t cost you anything to help us out. We should never have to spend real money on a game. I never have and never will. Also it takes forever to earn pool cash. It should be easier also. I do like the ten game tournaments. And i like having friends and clubs and the competition of the game. People can be stupid jerks but thats just people not the game. So its an ok game with alot of flaws that could be improved.

Then you have these real weirdos who dissect the tiniest stuff. Dude, this game is computer generated, yet it plays exactly the way real pool would play. It actually makes everyone of us better than we’d ever be in real life. There’s times when the ball just sits there and SPINS like a top spin the same as real pool. Do you how insane that is for all the calculations to go into this? Take what bezos makes in a yr, CUBE THAT MF to the 100th power and MAYBE that’s how many scenarios this game calculates.

Do you want what’s WRONG with this game? It’s WAY too addictive. For recovering gambling addicts this game is a problem. It’s creators invested greatly into people who work for the big casino chains. I’m not just talking about the obvious signs of the rewards etc being casino based.  To the people who are “truth seekers” “red pilled” they will understand what I’m talking about.

Game play is good but after you win some games it starts to cheat against you. I suspect that may change if you give up your Facebook info ( no way I’m doing that) or pay money ( I might if I didn’t feel cheated). As others say, you will see that some players just smack it hard and win. If you really try, you can see how the cue ball or your object ball is “influenced” by game handicap. If you like to feel cheated, this is the game for you! Update... so I leave a 2 star review and now it won’t connect. Coincidence? I don’t think so.

Update 2022- definitely cheats. I have paid occasionally and fared better. I played even though I know it cheats and I got up to 5M coins!  I have a 53% win ratio. But then started losing and dropped to 600k.  Scratching like crazy, make 7 in a row and then oddly snookered on the 8 ball. All kinds of strange things like missing a super easy shot or terrible bounces off the rail. Playing 100k games means I had to lose 45 more than I won or I would not have gone so far backward. That means if I played 100 games, I had to lose more than 70 of those.  And yet my win ratio has remained the same.  It just doesn’t make logical sense that my losses could suddenly pile up like that.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-29T06:50:07-07:00

Every match is supposed to be with someone around your skill level give or take up to 20. Their version of standard 8 ball is not the REAL RULES OF THE CURENT WORLD WE LIVE IN. On any break the 8 ball is sunk game is over. This is what happens on 9ball which you win but not 8 ball. If it’s sunk it’s reanimated onto the table again. Also when you break on in a game of 8 ball and both solid and stripes go down you should be given a choice of which one you want before you shoot again. Albeit if 1 goes in before the other then that’s what you will have to keep sinking in till the 8ball. Lastly standard 8ball ALL SHOTS ARE CALLED AND YOU CANT HIT YOUR BALL INTO OTHER PLAYERS BALL TO LET YOURS GO IN AND KEEP SHOOTING. Developers please if anything fix match ups. That’s the most unfair portion of this game. When you first start and you are a level 1 and you match me up with a 276. How is this even fair to new players. You think I want to play your game anymore. Also please fix the videos. There is NEVER ANY VIDEOS TO COLLECT FREE COINS. If non of these are fixed I will start a Blog about your game being unfairly matched and issues you haven’t fixed. I will be checking in game in 2 weeks.

Every person I’ve played with a ridiculously high win percentage (~60% and up) CHEATS and that’s why their percentage is so high. Why isn’t there a way to report the player for blatantly cheating during the match?! Also I’ve been playing this game for YEARS and the pop up’s in my face every 2 seconds are absolutely infuriating!!! There is no need for that, every single step of the way they designed it so that every action has a pop up screen, pop up ads etc IT’S NEVER ENDING. You have to X out of like 10 pop up screens/ ads just to get back to the game. What’s also infuriating is the fact that I NEVER GET TO BREAK. When I DO get to break no matter what method I use, no balls get potted usually. Keep in mind I have legendary level 2 cues so the “physics” just doesn’t make any sense. For every ONE game that they DO let me break, it’s followed by 20 games that I don’t break. This has wrecked my win percentage as well as my ability to win competitions/ event rings. If you’re not the one breaking, you can almost guarantee that you won’t even get to take a shot before the other person wins. So the fact that I only get to break about 20% of the time is really screwed up, they need to fix this. It should be exactly 50% of the time.

Game constantly wants you to buy in app purchases, not going to happen. Why would anyone spend  their money to buy coins not like you’re winning real money. Your never going to win any decent amount of coins on your free daily spin because of course they immediately give you a chance to buy another spin. I sometimes wonder if they even give you the little bit of coins you do win because the game hides your total amount when you spin so unless you remember to check your total before you spin you never know if you get the actual coins. Game has some annoying glitches as well, like when you put a ball right in front of a pocket and the app moves the ball back away from it. This happens every game. Another annoying glitch is if you hit your last ball in and the 8 ball in on the same shot it gives the win to your opponent this should not be the case especially when your last ball goes in long before the 8 ball drops. Of course the main goal of this game is to make the developers loads of money so they are going to do everything in their power to get you to spend more money.

I had been playing for a while when I realized I was running low on game tokens, and the app offered me a deal for a few bucks, so I figured, ok, why not? It was then, after I made a few purchases that I noticed I started loosing a lot more, and, surprise surprise, needing more tokens. Still, I figured, oh well, I’m just on a bad streak. One day after paying $14 to unlock one million or so coins, I started about a 20 straight game losing streak. So I actually started doing some tests. I had noticed I would miss simple shots by a pretty wide margin, so I actually got out a straight edge, and lined up my aiming vectors to go straight into the pocket. They missed by a HUGE margin.  I did this test about 20 times and I would say 15 of them missed. Also, during this losing streak after I conveniently payed money, I noticed I would NEVER sink a ball while breaking, whereas before I would sink a ball about 75% of the time on the break. The spin feature is definitely rigged as well, it’s about as consistent as a pair of dice. There are actually a lot of forums on this topic if you look for them online, and many other examples as to how it’s rigged in order to get you to spend money. Bummer.

This most likely won’t get seen but something needs done with the algorithm or something because I’m tired of wanting to try and play a match with a winning if 10,000 coins or more and always lose bc someone is a 200+ times my level. So in order for me to play I have to play the matches with a winning of 100 (that’s when I’m even lucky to get someone around my level)so how am I supposed to build coins at all? Did I mention that was for just 8 ball matches? Yeah, no I gave up on 9 ball that’s a joke you will NEVER be matched with anyone below 100!!

Other then that happening to me twice now, once when i first started playing in 2020 and now, I really love the game but i don’t know what to really do now. Sure i can save up the coins again but if it can make you auto join the most expensive game you can play after the game freezes and then it  crashes before you can play said game… Well it’s not exactly skill based at that point.. maybe they could add a “are you sure” button before you start the game to keep the auto join from happening while it crashes or something like the 9ball where you choose/accept the amount before playing :(",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-01T00:25:34-07:00

And also the fractional rating that goes with each cue, for example 30/8 makes no sense to me and the explanation in the game rules didn’t clarify it for me either. And a google search turned up nothing, which was a surprise to me actually. Also, the change made where the ad for free coins or cash now open the App Store, which I then have to close and then “x” the ad before getting back to the game, it’s more time then I’m willing to give it most of the time, so I play less than I used too. It would also be nice to change the chat order without having to hold and slide the phrase like it is now, it’s hard to organize when you have a lot of chat phrases and you can’t see and edit on one page.
