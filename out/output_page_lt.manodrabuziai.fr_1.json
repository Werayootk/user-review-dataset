I had wasted of the course of several days talking to several different “people” one even suggested to check my bank. Then one finally said oh “we stopped accepting visa.” Do not waste your time or do. I mean if that sounds like a fun time. I had made an Apple Pay account, a PayPal account. I even went so far as sending a picture of my passport to show who I was and I passed their “background check.” Guys run listen to the reviews I wasted a year of my life on this site. If you don’t want to waste hours of your life selling stuff. I even had a highly rated profile based on y sales. How much more can I say. At this point this is cathartic for me to rant about how much I loath this company. What’s worse is I had even expressed to coworkers how much I was selling and loved . So again I say run, don’t waste your time, money resources, stress and entire year I will never get back. By the way.

I was able to bump a couple of items the first week I had my account, but then this started happening and like I said, I’ve tried numerous times in the past month to get it resolved to no avail. They are quick to flag an item if your photo doesn’t satisfy the algorithm yet they aren’t there to help with technical issues.

They are being discriminatory and giving random people higher or lower rates. So many people are deleting their accounts, and that’s just the people who post about it in the forum. Then another response from someone else is that all the prices will change to be the most expensive. I understand about fluctuating USPS prices, but this is ridiculous. I ship through USPS often because of my small business. Up to 1 pound, first class, should never be over $6. There are no seller fees, but it’s being made up in overpriced shipping. No one is going to buy a used item for $1-$5 if they have to pay $6 for shipping. Which means items over one pound, like a bundle, will be $9 and a large bundle would be $11. I’d rather have the seller fee and lower shipping rates. Original post: Some people see shipping rates as .99 and some people see 2.49, 3.99, and even over $6 for the same item. It’s not consistent, and they don’t even know about this glitch even when people tried to reach out via feedback. The app has other bugs too and it’s almost not worth selling for a couple dollars and deal with this app. It was much better in 2013, when there was a 10% fee. Less bugs.

Why don’t they consider my history or make sure they’re NOT authentic before blocking my account. I made a sale that I can’t even ship out now cause they blocked my account. They need better customer support and find someone that knows the difference between real and fake items. I was just sold a fake Fendi and they did nothing about it. People\nMake a living off of these apps and they’re screwing with my income because they’re clueless… Poshmark is so much better.

It is user-friendly, straightforward, and my items would be purchased quickly for the prices I posted them for. I recently redownloaded after doing a closet clean out and listed a handful of barely-used, known-brand items for very fair prices. On an almost daily basis, I am having people send me super low-ball offers (I’m talking $1-2 for items worth more than that). When I decline the offers, they start harassing me, BEGGING me to sell them the items for their extremely low offers! I have had to block multiple users in the past week for this exact reason. This is getting ridiculous and I am highly considering jumping ship to a better app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-05T04:47:14-07:00"},{"id":"9228504442","userName":"jenn_ro","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112132895","version":"22.39.0","score":1,"title":"Report Vinted to Apple!","text":"The customer service is abysmal!! So bad that I have reported Vinted to Apple. If you are experiencing this type of customer service, as many of the reviewers have stated, I implore you to report Vinted to Apple too. As a seller, I did not receive any protection from their CS team over a package not delivering to a customer. Like another reviewer stated, I can attest to the perfunctory replies and platitudes by their CS team. Vinted offered me no guidance and put the whole burden on me when I have the slightest clue on how to do it. They provide the labels and have all the records I need to file a claim with the postal service. This shipping process is a primary and CRITICAL FUNCTION of Vinted, yet I got zero support. I too have had past issues with bumps like some of the other reviewers. Once I sort out this USPS nightmare all BY MYSELF, I am deleting this app once and for all. Depop is the only reselling app you need folks!!!!

Mind you in just one week over 100 different listings were posted of medical scrubs. I went back even further and one from 5 months ago is still posted. Let’s not get started on their shipping fees which are ridiculous. Even with items priced at a dollar they don’t sell because who wants to pay $1 plus fees plus shipping. I have done much much better selling on Mercari and Poshmark with having sellers fees. Don’t try and communicate with the company either because there isn’t an option.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-04T09:59:09-07:00"},{"id":"9310653996","userName":"cindynbrady","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id116848479","version":"22.42.1","score":1,"title":"Ridiculous people running this site","text":"I was new to the site, I started posting my listings. I sell on multiple platforms. In the middle of listing items, they blocked me while posting a authentic highly name-brand purse. Sending me a message that the items I am listing are fake. I have never had a issue selling any of my items that I have paid a lot of money for and resold for a third or half the price because the quality is still very good and well taken care of. I would give them zero stars if I could and tell people definitely do not use them. There are plenty of sites so much better and won’t give you any crap. Those sites also, if they have questions will contact you first. Also mentioned my photos were copyrighted, when you can clearly tell they are taken on a blanket laying on my bed.

I started on a different popular app that starts with a “P”. This app is the ONLY one I’ve ever had issues with as a seller. My items were constantly deleted without good reason or my consent. I got a message saying they were deleted after the fact. So I stopped using stock photos, no big deal. Today I got 15 items deleted because they accused me of “selling commercially” because some of my items have tags. uhhh yeah??? I sell things I can’t RETURN or that don’t fit me anymore. That’s literally the point of RESELL APPS. Their customer service is a joke and they have no empathy for their users. As a stay at home parent this is my only form of income and it’s not like it pays the bills. To have my hard work and time (and it takes a lot of time to list well) just erased is infuriating. You will have a much smoother experience elsewhere I promise.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-10T11:10:19-07:00"},{"id":"9230001904","userName":"medievalminiskirt","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id222457830","version":"22.39.0","score":1,"title":"Taking Down Listings","text":"I like to use PhotoRoom to make sure my listings look nice and clean w a white background when I post them, as I’ve found that appeals to me and usually others when shopping.  I got a pair of aerie underwear that I’m trying to sell taken down because I laid out two (separately sold pairs) of underwear on a white background and god forbid it looked too professional, now this app thinks I’m stealing images from the internet.  The worst part is that the underwear isn’t sold as a pair so there is no way they even checked this, or even reverse image searched my photo.  I wanna support this app because it seems very seller friendly with the whole no fee thing, but not everything can be automated.  Even their first few responses to my contact about this issue has been automated. What a nightmare.

I cannot appel this vinted just went ahead and deleted it. They dont give you any option to appeal any report a user makes. It will count against you and if too many you will bw kicked from the app. I think it’s terrible I now am closer to being booted when I did nothing wrong and I cannot talk to any customer support about this issue and my listing being wrongfully deleted.

The offers have gotten ridiculous and don't even get me started on shipping. The costs were somewhat reasonable at first and now they are out of control. That's how the app makes their money so it's not surprising after gaining popularity they jacked up costs.
