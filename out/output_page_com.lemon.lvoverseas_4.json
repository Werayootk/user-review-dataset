Also there is a problem with the storage, if you make a video on CapCut and save it, you can find out that CapCut itself actually is the cause of full storage, not the video itself, but I have found some solutions, use less effects and add ones so you can have less storage it’ll take, but if you really wanna use a lot, delete it off CapCut after saving it so you can only access it in your video album, this prevents most to all the storage that one video will take up, but the problem with that is, if you notice a mistake while watching it, you can’t go back. It’s not easy to edit on top of it so you’ll have to live with it. I get annoyed by this but I need to save storage to make more videos. I hope you understand.

However, it had the apps name all over the videos and there wasn’t really much I could do on that app.  Then I discovered CapCut!! I have been able to make so many of the videos I’ve always dreamed of making. It also seems like there is an incredible update on here everyday.

The effects, transitions, everything looks so smooth and satisfying, and is relatively simple to use and understand. \nHowever, I am disappointed in the “Pro” section. I always looked forward to this program being a free, easy to use app and use effects freely. I was extremely disappointed to see that I can’t use some of my favorite effect (such as the “Smart Sharpen” effect) for my videos. It’s so sad to see that happen, and with transitions, filters, voice effects, etc. \nI would only request to remove that filter to make it accessible to everyone, so people can edit freely and easily without needing to worry about any extra fees.\nOtherwise, an amazing program.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-30T20:26:57-07:00"},{"id":"8577456873","userName":"Irealy_hatepink","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id481648777","version":"5.7.0","score":5,"title":"Very good just some issues","text":"I really like the app and it is very easy to use, but there are 2 tiny issues that I’ve faced while using it.

I also had a hard time adding multiple short pictures for an animation because every time I tried to check my work to see how it looked it was VERY choppy and I had to save the entire video just to see how a tiny snippet looked which made it hard to check mistakes. These both got so annoying it was hard to get motivated to even use the app. Again it’s very good and I suggested this to many people but theses issues really bother me so some how fix it if you can, not sure if it’s just my device but my device is very new so I would be worried if it was.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-04-17T07:54:23-07:00"},{"id":"8520953298","userName":"Hannaceline24","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id427374815","version":"5.5.0","score":5,"title":"Amazing App, Just Three Things","text":"I’ve been using Capcut for some time, and it’s been amazing!

Again, it doesn’t seem too annoying at first, but increases later on. For example, using a green screen. The green screen would be the main, while the others that would be on top would be the overlay.

While generally its less than 700MB it will randomly triple that and fill up all of your phone staging and make it impossible to film anything on your camera or save pictures due to “insufficient storage” which is just untrue. The only way to fix this is delete the app and then redownload it- loosing all of your files. You’d think that because you can have an account on CC all your projects would be saved but no. This means if the glitch occurs you have to download every single project, delete the app, reinstall it and add every video back in and just hope the editing still works from there without too many issues.

And then a couple months later after I wrote the review originally no changes at all and it got worse I won’t even let me delete the app like dude let me delete the app!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-02T19:10:22-07:00"},{"id":"7820234391","userName":"jr is stupid","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1153780491","version":"4.3.0","score":5,"title":"GREAT! 1 update suggestion","text":"This app is great and easy! And I was pleased to see that it was free! But I think an update could be that you make videos and interact with other people on the app and then can put up un edited videos up on the different tab and you can go on edit and press done then it would send the creator a message/notification saying you edit it it for them and they can approv it and put a 1-5 start rating and if you do that you can like get stars which can get you something new and they add 3 things everyday but you might not get them and it will say better luck next time and you can comment on videos. Like a editing version of tiktok!! Ik this is a long shot idea for you guys to see this but I think it’s is a great idea. But you don’t have to listen to me!😀Nice Game!!

I would use CapCut all the time on my phone but then one day it started saying no WiFi please try again, so I went and checked my WiFi and it was perfectly fine so I looked it up online and apparently it’s a glitch and it could be fixed so I tried many videos to fix it but none worked so I had to try deleting the app and getting it again and when I reinstalled it it still said that so I lost all my edits for nothing. 😢PLEASE could you guys fix it 🥺🙏🙏. Other then that it’s an Amazing app and I love it ( I use it on my iPad now) and it’s wonderful such cool filters and stickers and I could use my green screen with it it’s so cool and free! I would %100 recommend this app. Could you guys PLEASE reply and try to fix this glitch 🥺🙏🙏","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-21T15:55:57-07:00"},{"id":"8278667429","userName":"Ana1984777","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id86216406","version":"5.2.1","score":4,"title":"PLEASE FIX THE STORAGE/CACHE ISSUE!","text":"I LOVE THIS APP! It is easy to use and I love that. I love everything about it except for one thing... it consumes A LOT of storage and even after I delete projects, it will still fill my storage. I have tried to clear the cache and it will say it’s clear yet still my storage is full from this app. I have to delete the app every time I use it to clear the “documents and data” storage. I appreciate that this app saves your videos so that you can delete them from your camera roll without them deleting in the app, but once I edit the videos, the parts I take out should delete from the storage too or something because it’s such a pain. I end up editing like an hour worth of videos down to 10-15 min total then can’t save the video cause my storage is full. Please please please just fix the cache so we can clear the data not used.

I have made so many cool edits with my brother and quarantine friends. This app has legit saved me from boredom 1000 times. It has cool effects and great quality too. Me and my friends made a music video to the “Ai Ai Ai, I’m your little butterfly” song. And since CapCut has the “remove background” button (that is free) we could make my friends little brother sour through the sky.... like a little butterfly lol. I would also recommend this to people who vlog. Between the awesome effects and translation, you can make pro edits! You can also make Gacha stories with it. The only thing I would recommend tho is more anime-ish sound effects and effects. I also would suggest longer songs, maybe real ones that are popular but I understand due to copyright. Yeah, other than that great app! ✌️😁","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-02T11:45:56-07:00"}]
