It's my favorite mobile game and it brings me a lot of joy. I love the daily quests, the missions, the consistent updates, and the character designs. I really appreciate how hard the developers work on the game and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who hasn't downloaded it. The only complaint I have about the game itself is the amount of ads and pay-to-win aspects incorporated into the game—but even that is bearable.

However, there is one glitch that I've noticed. It has happened to me quite a few times over the past year and it's quite inconvenient for gameplay. Today I almost passed 10,000,000 points but I ran into a train. I tried to revive with an ad, but the button went grey and started loading. I waited and waited but the ad wasn't opening (which was odd since my WiFi was working perfectly fine). I tried to revive with a key but the button wasn't working. I even tried to press out of the game and back into the home screen. Eventually, I had to close out of the app and reopen it. Unfortunately, I lost all of my progress. This is the most recent occurrence but this has happened to me multiple times and it's very frustrating. I lost over an hour of my time. 

I hope you take my review into consideration and find the root to this problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-08T20:02:17-07:00
10149901737,Day Nine Is Monday,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1549733691,3.15.0,4,Please read…,"首先，我非常喜欢Subway Surfers这款游戏。其次，这是我对这款游戏的几个建议；第一，我作为一个中国玩家，看到出了中国城市版本时，我的心里是无比激动的，并且我特别喜欢洛阳版本，背景音乐不仅好听，地图也十分精美，限定人物也很好看。不过，看遍Subway Surfers的所有版本，也只出了十六个中国城市版本，我希望Sybo Games能够多出中国城市版本，让外国友人们见识到中华文化的博大精深。第二，我玩Subway Surfers的一个主要原因是它让我在家就可以游遍全球，不过，我希望Sybo Games在设计下个版本时，你们能够先了解这个城市的人文历史和地标建筑。Subway Surfers作为2012年上架App Store的游戏，距今已有11年的历史，全球下载量更是突破三十亿，已经是游戏发展史上不可缺失的一环了。最后，祝愿Subway Surfers越做越大，Sybo Games越来越好。

First of all, I really like Subway Surfers. Second, here are my suggestions for the game; First, as a Chinese player, when I saw the Chinese city version, my heart was very excited, and I especially like the Luoyang version, the background music is not only good, the map is also very beautiful, and the limited characters are also very good-looking. However, after watching all the Subway Surfers versions, there are only 16 Chinese city versions. I hope Sybo Games can have more Chinese city versions so that foreign friends can see the profound Chinese culture. Second, one of the main reasons I play Subway Surfers is because it allows me to travel around the world from my home, but I hope Sybo Games will take a look at the city's human history and landmarks when designing the next version. Subway Surfers, an 11-year-old game released on the App Store in 2012, has been downloaded more than three billion times worldwide and is an indispensable part of the history of gaming. Finally, wish Subway Surfers bigger and better and Sybo Games better and better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-17T03:40:25-07:00

But there are two things that bug me. First, one day it just suddenly wouldn’t load. I knew it wasn’t my fault because at the time I had 20+ GB of storage left on my phone. So, I deleted the app and redownloaded it. But if I hadn’t logged in with Facebook I would have lost everything and it made me a little teeny bit panicky. This is the main reason I had to take off a star. This was from the last update where Tutti was the main prize, and it hasn’t happened to me since so maybe it has already been resolved. However, it may be helpful to be able to make a Subway Surfers account for those who are unable to use Facebook or GameCenter. Also, it irks me how the new seasons don’t come out immediately after the old one ends. I know you people have them ready and are just keeping us in suspense. I need all the time possible to grind. I know I’m an impatient screenager but I’m just saying! To end on a good note though, the Underwater season has been my favorite yet. I am sad to see it go but luckily I obtained all the new items that didn’t require an in-app purchase. However, I am considering buying a permanent additional 5x multiplier or double coins because it would be worth it because I love this game so much.

(if that wouldn’t have happened then it would be 5. i strongly recommend that you revert the game to its traditional setup and layout. thanks)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-20T01:51:48-07:00

I was pretty mad because when I went on shop, the Japanese character was off-sale because there were 40 more minutes into it being on-sale, but the thing I HATE about her, is that she’s for money, if I was the owner, I would make her for Tokyo coins or something. The funny part about it is that I was in the car playing and I lost, then I wanted to see the new characters for The Tokyo Update, then I saw the Japanese girl, for a minute it didn’t show the price so I thought it was free, I pressed it and it said “Purchase Failed do to Connection Error” I then realized stupidly that I was in a car with no connection, so I quickly went on settings and put in WiFi I was panicking because there was 4 more hours into the character until it was off-sale. I quickly got the WiFi and went back on Subway Surfers, turns out, she was for MONEY. I was frustrated because I wasted my time. The other thing I HATE about all the updates in Subway Surfers, IS THE NEW ONE, not only did they keep most of the Tokyo Update, THEY ALSO MADE IT MORE  LAGGER, AND WHEN THE CHARACTERS JUMP, THEY LAG! If you were about to download the update, don’t, just don’t. It’s one of the WORST updates that I’ve ever seen.

Subway Surfers is legit a classic cellphone game and i miss the days where i would play it all the time so that’s why i downloaded it again recently. The only gripe i have is the fact that it’s ad based. I personally would pay maybe $5-10 to remove ads permanently. I’d then spend more money on coins and surf boards and stuff like that if it meant keeping my things for a long time because I know in that instant I’d have instant access to the game 10 fold. I know you guys are an ad based game but I wouldn’t really spend my money at the money because of the fact that the ads take away from my experience. I’m a casual player and ads take away from my experience. I went to the shop to look at character packs and what not and got ads before I even did my run. If you guys could remove ads that would be perfect- i know more people would opt for the game if they didn’t have to sit through ads after every run/every couple runs. I love the game and i’m a big fan even to the point where the Subway Surfers series made me happy to hear about and watch! 

If you guys see this please let me know if this is too much? I’m not against ads on games but this is one I would genuinely spend really good money on if it meant being able to play at my own pace.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-22T12:37:59-07:00

I love how you can see your score while you’re running and you can try to beat other people’s scores and how you can collect coins without having to watch ads. This is a great game but there are a few things that could be better. I was scrolling through the characters and I saw that the character called Boombox was free. I clicked on it and the game showed me pictures of coins that you had to pay for. It said nothing about the character being free. In fact, it said nothing about the character at all. I left the game and went back in and tried it again. It did the exact same thing. I don’t think you should make something free if people aren’t able to get to it. Second, how come when you stumble the cops catch up to you so quick?  When you  stumble on the tracks I think it should take a couple of seconds for them to catch up. Instead of that though they catch up to you the second you fall. That doesn’t seem right. Also I once went into the game without internet and it said I couldn’t play without internet. That’s weird because I’ve played without internet before. If these were fixed I would definitely give a 5 star rating.

First of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything. I am pretty mad about that because it took a long time to save up for all the characters I got. I’m really lucky because I didn’t use any money to buy anything. If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I’m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It’s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load. And it also for some reason only works at a certain time of day. It didn’t do that before this terrible update came out. And it’s not my WiFi because every other game works expect this one ☹️.

At first I thought “oh it’s just a glitch! (Like the Taylor swift song haha) just awful school wifi haha you know how that is!” So I decided to completely close the app, turn on my hotspot, and reopen the app. And when I did, my music paused, again. So i decided to open another game, and to my surprise, my music did not pause. I even decided to try doing this at home and maybe my music would play at home, but no, it also paused. Please fix this.

8028234079,#KazyGamer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1242505718,2.25.2,5,Great Overall.,"Subway Surfers is an original endless-running game. You’re a criminal who was caught by a police officer, and are running away. While you’re running you collect coins and gifts for upgrades and more. You can compete in events, or just attend to them, and there are only ads when you ask for them. (To get free coins, keys, etc.) You can unlock new characters to play with, unlock surfboards, and get daily rewards the more you play. If you don’t like the music, and would like to change it, you can do that in game settings. Or, you may just not want music at all, and you can also manage that in game settings. You could also turn sounds effects off if you would like. Only two suggestions I have is to be able to race your friends. Y'know, see who can survive the longest without reviving. Also, once you get to a certain stage in game, you could unlock a mode where you could be the police officer or dog. And you could also unlock prank materials to pull on the criminal to make him or her slow down. I am aware I have interesting suggestions, but perhaps taking it into thought would improve the game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-15T16:06:58-07:00
2427138887,TomRiddle4Lifezzz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id777124643,1.86.0,4,Needs some improvement,"One of the things I like about this game is that there are no ads. They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-04-15T14:29:55-07:00

It is amazing game ever inside your world and also it’s just my opinion and I love it forever and ever it’s kind of like a best game to me. It’s like it’s real life and you could also try it in real life it just a little bit dangerous don’t go on the train or else you will die. It’s really important to know. All of that stuff is dangerous only some stuff are safe in subway surfers. It’s just a parkour game and also police that does not want you to write on the wall. it’s kind of like your parents when you were younger when you write it on the wall your parents got mad at you like they were the police officer that’s really dangerous I used to play police and criminal with my brother when I was younger and when he was younger but then he twisted my bones so it got out of place. It really hurt really bad so I went to go cry to my dad. We went to the doctors and then I drink some medicine. I did some stuff with my arm and then it completely went away. That’s why you don’t try it at home at all, it’s amazing and download it now.

The ads are skip-able and most of the time only show up if you want them to, like to get a reward or something, which is really nice since most games now have ads like every 2 minutes. It’s also very fun and it updates very often so you don’t get bored of the same thing, items are also not too hard to get but not too easy and the quests are fun! There’s only really one problem and it’s not a big one, anyways, when you lose a round, there’s a pop up that lets you revive with a key or you can watch an ad to let you continue to play, however if you pick the ad option, after you finish the ad the game ends and you end up at the game over page instead of continuing where you left off. And most of the time it works but it’s kinda sad when you want to get a high score and you try to revive yourself but you sorta watched an ad for nothing. So not that big of a deal but just thought to let you guys know! This is a great game though!

So i played it for the Miami world and the Peru world and i had most of the characters but when the Halloween update came out for this new season it wasn’t updating my game. So i asked my cousin what to do and she said since you are logged on to Facebook and Game Center it will save your progress so i deleted the game so it would update and when i did i lost all my characters ( especially my favorite three Coco, Liu, and Aina). I was really sad about this but in the end i guess it’s my fault for deleting the app, but i want to tell people that if this happens to you just wait it out especially if you’re really far in the game sure you will miss out in a season but you won’t loose your progress.

To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. 
I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys. 
 Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes. 
 As you can see this is a very good game.  Go on your devices and buy it now.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-09T12:37:47-07:00

There are also an insane amount of in-game events now, and while I do appreciate the developers trying to keep the game engaging, when I open the app I'm greeted with 5 pop-up windows of events I've missed, events that are happening, events that are coming soon, and of course they're all the same event, it just ends and starts so that you won't save up enough event coins to buy anything. Developers, if you want people to have a reason to play, some new achievements and better missions would do just fine.

I also think you guys should have running trails to add onto your skin like the bubble gum trail for the boards maybe like a gold mist going where you run. I think the game could be a lot more fun with all these things, and possibly a profitable profit for you guys, add new cool things then more people will get the game again and keep purchasing things, anyways just a suggestion this is a really good game but sometimes it can be boring overtime because it’s same thing",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-25T10:25:12-07:00

I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said “loading”. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review.

The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they’re a little bit expensive. Don’t get me wrong they’re great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn’t hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

Don’t get me wrong, it does come in handy, but when I’m mid-jump and they run out of the little bar thing at the bottom (idk what it’s called), the charge of them if you will, and I’m going over a jump with coins and the sneakers run out and i’m left in the air not getting the remainder of the coins...that makes me so unbelievably annoyed. I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes.

It’s fun, it and gets very addicting (in a good way) what I really like about it is that it gives you the option to change your avatar, and to get upgrades. It also gives multiple fun upgrades through out the game, such as being able to collect all the coins at one time, or flying through the air on a jet back. It’s at the best level where it’s challenging, but not a impossible game to play, so it’s perfect for people that want to play a fun game, that’s not to easy. I’d say the only thing I would have against this game is sometimes it gets just a little boring, especially if you play the game all the time. All I’m asking is to make the game a bit more adventuress and different, like being able to choose what the background is, for example, like a jungle or something, instead of having to collect a certain amount of special coins to get a change of scenery (which by the way, takes for ever to collect them all, to be honest). All it needs is a bit more surprises and then it’ll definitely be a 5 out of 5 review.

also I think it would be really nice if you guys could make something else like Subway surfers I’m not saying I don’t like it I think it will just be really fun to have two games similar so if one person doesn’t like Subway surfers maybe they like the other game that you guys made if you decide to make one and if somebody doesn’t like the other game that you guys made they might still like Subway surfers but like I said just a suggestion to make another game like Subway surfers not forcing you

You need to play this game. I love all the characters, although it is hard to achieve what you need to get them; it’s a nice challenge. I love how you get to beat other people high score and compete! I also love how when you get later in the game it speeds up, that’s just so fun. I also love the boosters; like the magnet, the high jump boot, the jet pack, the hoverboard, and the pogo stick. It is really fun to collect letters to make a word and get achievements to make money off of.( Not real money of course.😉) I also like how they change the theme to what’s happening in the world. Like they use to have a Valentines one, then when Easter came, they created an Easter theme. Last but not least, I like how it’s offline and online, because many games you can only play online. So, you shouldn’t be on the fence anymore. I just gave you like 100 reasons to play this game. So, go ahead and press the download button. When you play your going to love it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-16T15:02:51-07:00

I like the update as it makes the game feel kind of new, I play on an iPhone 11 so I haven’t noticed any issues with the games performance, I’m only writing this review in support of the Devs in hopes that they might be able to add a couple of things I’ve been wishing for since the beginning. The ability to have a random surfer option and random board option would be great for those of us that have unlocked everything for one. Also while I love the game it’s time to let us go underground, I love the jet pack and flying around but it’s over due for a new bonus area or coin grab such as tunnels that go underground then you pop back up onto the tracks from the side of the map or even a side exit wear we venture through a mall, museum or a sports field. We’ve been running straight ahead long enough this could make the game take back some players who have left... just some food for thought...I do live the game and look forward to all updates, just time to see it expand and grow a bit.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-29T02:05:25-07:00

I really like the game it is compatible with IOS 11 for sure and possibly IOS 12.  No complaints here except there should be more Keyes to collect in the subway as well as the thing that you have to find for the weekly challenge there is definitely not enough if ether of those but other than that I would definitely get it and I am 13 years old.  for all of you people who gave it a bad review 6 years ago well here is something to think about i like to look at good and bad comments and for every good comment I want to buy it every bad well here is the thing just because it is kinda like temple run and yes I have played temple run 1 and 2 subway surfers is better you get mystery boxes, challenges, I also think the hover boards are pretty cool.  That is no reason to give it one star and if you actually give the app a chance I think anybody would like it I think if the only bad comments are the app keeps crashing or the Same stinking thing then that could just be a not updated device so my advice to anybody don’t knock it till you try it.

It’s a good game for calculation and is TERRIFIC for kids. It feels so realistic,  that is what makes it even more fun. I like the idea of the different powers you can collect from the game when your playing a round and there are so much collections of boards an skins! Although I have only been playing the game for 1-2 days now, I CAN ALREADY IMAGINE PLAYING THE GAME FOR A LIFETIME! It never gets boring and it passes time when you are free. My brother and I always take turns playing and we build decent relationship. Seeing the videos of the game may seem like it has easy calculation and game play, IT’S NOT! But that is what makes the game most fun. The more you play, the more challenging it gets, and it is always fun to see what’s next. I hope people agree that this game is awesome as much as I think. If I could, I’d give the game 1,000,000,000/5 stars, but that’s beyond App Store abilities. So far, no suggestions but I will make another review is something ketches my eye. LOVE THE GAME, I recommend you download if possible!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-22T17:57:29-07:00
6159137354,gr8gab,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1139750142,2.2.1,5,Great!,"This is a very popular game that has managed to find its way into nearly everyone’s device at some point. I’ve taken it off and on over the last few years, and this time it’s definitely here to stay. I’ve always been satisfied with this game and have loved the changes. This time (since I re-downloaded) I’ve gotten a lot more into the game, collecting the characters and boards, and completing the challenges. It’s a lot of fun!

There is one thing that I would love to see. When you get a power up like the coin magnet or the bouncy shoes a little flash of light shoots out! Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away. Too many times have I tried to jump over a train only to realize too late my bounce shoes are gone!

Thank you for your work!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-04T23:02:40-07:00

When COVID hit I decided to download it again since I had nothing to do. Several things had changed since I last had it but I got used to it quickly. One thing I do miss was the original music. It’s cool that the music changes to the theme but in my opinion it’s just not the same without the og music. There’s nothing else I had a problem with until the most recent updates. The event coins. They’re not that bad but now it feels very overwhelming with all the things you have to do. You have to worry about the season hunt, the word hunt, coins, keys, and now event coins. You can pay with event coins to get characters now but I would rather just use keys. Also, you get prizes when you collect a certain amount of season tokens, such as a new character and an outfit but this time, they didn’t give you a character or their outfit. Instead they gave event coins. I would much rather have a free character than event coins. I hope the next update will include a character in the season hunt instead of event coins.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-16T18:41:46-07:00
1867077558,GodfatherGaming,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id645882342,1.78.0,5,5 Star Runner,"Highly recommended Runner, concept is good obstacles are good and randomly placed as it scrolls. Great challenge system implemented; giving players “Milestones” looking forward. Games like this can easily be repetitive, the challenge system doesn’t completely take that away but definitely helps. Great app for the current version, runs perfect on my iPhone SE. if I could change anything it would possible be different subway backgrounds to give a different feel for where you maybe few examples “abandoned subway” like the one in Cincinnati Ohio, or New York or Boston type of Subway. I’m sure the devs could possibly implement something of that nature rather simple. Then you could make a “premium” version thus driving more revenue to make more great games. Possibly more power ups to run with, premium players would get access to free power ups once a month maybe 5 of each that can be “stackable” and do not expire. Just a few ideas and an actual helpful review not someone crying about how the game restarted on them or bashing you for bugs that nearly every app will encounter here and there.

I love all the characters, boards, and fun tracks! This game is just awesome, there’s not to many ad and most things you buy with real money is really cheap! There is one way that I’d love for you guys to change! I would like a choice for what Biome I’m in, like when it’s North Pole time, I don’t really like how that looks so I think I should have a choice to change it back to original! I’m actually a 11 year old and I think this game should be more loved! No one I know still plays this game so, I think you gotta add something more exciting, like a creator tool! As a fellow artist, I think a creator would be fun! It could be a 99 cents bundle! When you buy it, you get a choice to design there on characters, boards, and even tracks! They can post it on “SurferMedia” and other people can download it! People can play with it and then they can comment, like, and if they hate it they would put a dislike! 
Please respond and tell me if any of this is possible!

7979638217,PAPI NUNZ,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1344693227,2.25.0,4,Mind Games,"I want to start out by saying this game punishes the skillful players. 100% speaking from experience. I have ranked #1 in the US time and time again and that’s not me boasting.. this is me saying it’s pretty hard to throw me off my game. 
For some reason though, at times blatantly I get sabotaged, even when I don’t touch the screen at all. I could be running straight forward towards a jet pack and then without even any contact between my fingers and the phone screen my player will switch lanes and throw me into a frenzy. I’m forced to waste a hover board, keys, or sit through some moronic ad; stealing my rhythm away from me. 
Or the other way they mess with you is speed up and slow down the pace of the game. Most noticeable with the jet pack. It almost seems like there’s an actual person on the other side making conscious decisions on how to make you fail. 
Idk why they think they are slick.. they are most certainly not. All in all I gave it 4 stars because I enjoy proving myself time and time again against the unfair “glitchy” game that is subway surfers.

It literally increased my natural reflexes due to the fact that you as a player must be able to do things such as prevent an opponent from having an advantage fast. By this I literally mean using your ability to cope with hard and difficult situations and win the game fast.

The very huge exclusion of giving the game a five star rating is obviously the difficult, yet time taking objectives which need to be completed just to complete an entire stack of objectives. From multiplayer matches all the way down to different types of battle royale gameplay mode. In multiplayer matches I see a huge disadvantage of playing against players who are really good in playing. Accuracy and shooting of opponents are far tough to survive through especially in domination mode in multiplayer matches.

Gameplay must be also set in terms of measuring a players’ aiming, shooting accuracy and shooting speed in order to prevent matches from getting extremely tough. Also please increase the limit of players that give points to their team in Team Death Match or at most allow the player to decide how many points are required to win the competition just to complete a tough objective.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-31T23:08:42-07:00

That’s when I became obsessed with this game. This game has completely crushed my grades, social life, and passion for anything else. My teachers all hate me because I’m always playing subway surfers during their lessons. My friends all left me and made new friends that now bully me for playing this game. My father left me and my mother wants to put me up for adoption but can’t because I spent all of her money on this game. Not only did all of this happen, but the next thing is how I ended up where I am now. I wanted to get a job at McDonald’s because me and my mom were broke after I spent all of our money on this game. I got the job somehow, but was immediately fired for playing this game the whole time and dragging one of the customers by their foot when they asked if they could play. Afterwards, I just stood by some buildup to play subway surfers. I guess I wasn’t supposed to be there since a cop showed up. The only thing I’ve learned to do when the cops come is to run like they do in the game, so that’s exactly what I did. I ran as fast as I could and the cop ran after me. I tripped and fell almost immediately since I move around and the cop handcuffed me. I’m now writing this bad review in jail.
