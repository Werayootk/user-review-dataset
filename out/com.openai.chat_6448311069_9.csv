The language model is quite proficient at generating responses and engaging in conversation. However, there are a couple of drawbacks worth mentioning.

Firstly, the information provided is not always up to date and accurate. It's crucial to double-check facts from more reliable sources when needed.

Secondly, when instructing ChatGPT to write messages to others, there is a tendency for recipients to perceive it as not genuinely coming from me. Whether it's the tone or style, it sometimes raises suspicions that I might be using a robot or an automated service.

Despite these limitations, I appreciate the convenience and versatility that ChatGPT offers. It's a handy tool for generating ideas and creative content.

Overall, a valuable resource, but proceed with caution in situations where accuracy and personal touch are crucial",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-22T14:42:11-07:00
