Now I will delete my FB app, because l'm so annoyed with the CEOs behavior. I feel there's plenty of room in the social media world for other apps that might compete with FB. Yet Zuckerberg lobbied hard to bring help Congress build a case to ban Tiktok. This took it too far for me. Seriously, FB has many data privacy issues and is a huge risk for US citizens and our government security. If we’re being honest FB is the easiest place for someone to get hacked. It's even had a breach where Russia tried to manipulate our Presidential elections. Congress should get real about who's really violating the US's privacy and stop lying to manipulate the narrative all for your personal interest. If it's data insecurity, Tiktok has secured our data better than any current US application. So that can't be the problem. We (U.S. citizens) are tired of dealing with a Congress that operates under a misguided, hypocritical agenda, and is one that can be bought by corrupt, spoiled tech CEOs. What we can thank Zuckerberg for is opening our eyes & showing us who not to vote for as our representatives.

It's clear that the platform's primary concern is not the well-being of its users, but rather the financial gains it can reap from their personal data.\nTime and time again, Facebook has demonstrated its willingness to exploit users' information for its own benefit, with little regard for the potential harm this can cause. The company's repeated failures to adequately protect user data have led to countless privacy breaches and data leaks, leaving users vulnerable to identity theft, cybercrime, and other serious threats.\nMoreover, Facebook's opaque and convoluted privacy policies make it nearly impossible for users to understand what information the company is collecting, how it's being used, and who it's being shared with. This lack of transparency is unacceptable, and it leaves users feeling helpless and exposed.\nTo make matters worse, Facebook has shown little remorse for its actions, and has done little to rectify the damage it has caused. The company's half-hearted attempts at addressing privacy concerns feel more like lip service than a genuine effort to do better.\nOverall, if you value your privacy and security, it's best to steer clear of Facebook. The platform's track record when it comes to protecting user data is abysmal, and it's clear that the company has no intention of changing its ways.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-28T04:58:53-07:00"},{"id":"8787642205","userName":"dee delladonna","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1287594441","version":"370.0","score":1,"title":"Delete IG but jail FB users and all for profit research","text":"FB is Absolute garbage and I am so glad I left it years ago.

Meta has allowed som seriously racist and bigoted things go on it’s platform. If there isn’t on already I plan to start a group on META where women can go and post the things meta allows that are misogynistic and racist. Well in second though I’ll make two, I have a feeling they will be very busy and separate categories would be better for organization. I’ll come back to edit this with the group names invade anyone who reads this wants to participate. It’s time META gets with the times. I mean what can we expand from a company that was started so some college guy could rate the bang-ability of his women classmates?

Has been for years. Your personal information is not protected! This app is also ran by a lobbyist. How the congressman treated the CEO of TikTok was out right shameful and embarrassing. This app’s owner is willing to ruin businesses and entrepreneurs over money for himself. The congressman has spilled nothing but allegations towards the TikTok CEO with no evidence of anything. It was a battle of he said she said and opinions. The CEO was not given the chance to speak up, for he was constantly interrupted and disrespected. TikTok is a large platform that has worked its way in to the American economy. Business has boomed, profit to the people has increased, companies even have started linking themselves to TikTok through QR codes. All of that plummets if TikTok is banned. We highly recommend you stay away from Meta related apps, for the owners are power hungry lobbyists that will harm you financially and through your data by selling it. Even if you do not like TikTok, please see through the damage that will be done if Meta’s lobbying to ban TikTok wins. This could lead to a potential domino effect onto other social media apps that may even wind up being your most favored one. Until further notice, Meta is against you.

The business started doing really good for the first 3 weeks of posting and was beginning to become highly rated on the marketplace. March 1 comes around and I receive a notification that I can no longer buy or sell on the marketplace due to “violation”. I have reviewed their guidelines and looked through my listings and found no such violation. I have requested for a review and waited and still can’t get an answer to what I did wrong. I am really disappointed in the facebook experience and realize why I never even used the Facebook account when I first created it. I attempted to create another page only to run into another restriction on how many stuff I can post. I’m just trying to grow my business, make a living, and put food on the table but Facebook wants to do more harm than good by denying my marketplace usage. The whole situation is frustrating, Facebook will deny and restrict a legitimate page but allow scammers to run freely asking people for google verification digits or other information.

In my opinion, this addition has only served to frustrate and dilute the overall video-watching experience. First and foremost, the Watch section was initially intended for videos, and it excelled in providing a streamlined platform for users to discover and enjoy a wide variety of video content. However, the introduction of Reels has cluttered the once-clean interface with short, repetitive snippets that lack substance and relevance. I find it frustrating to scroll through a mix of meaningful videos and mindless Reels, as it hinders my ability to discover the type of content I am genuinely interested in. The inclusion of Reels in the Watch section feels redundant. Reels already have their dedicated space within the main Facebook feed, where users can easily access and engage with this specific form of content. Merging them into the Watch section only serves to create confusion and diminishes the overall quality of the video-watching experience. It seems that Facebook's decision to merge these two features was made without considering the negative impact it would have on user satisfaction.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-03T18:35:52-07:00"},{"id":"9718487855","userName":"you will have a lawsuit","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id482359929","version":"406.0","score":1,"title":"To Facebook as a whole and to whom ever it may concern","text":"OK Facebook I’m gonna tell you something that you might think is very scary or not, I should say, your try to get TikTok banned because it’s a national security threat but Facebook meta-google politicians which ever you want to call yourself which pretend to not be a part of the banning of you because you don’t make money from TikTok, the US not just that, you should worry about us coming after you a lot have to come after the generation z who found out you will have to fight you’ll  lose no matter but the question is do you want to lose money with it the - oh, I’m rich so nothing will affect me health-wise or in money but you’re wrong.

I could understand if the app was actually a clean and wholesome place, but it’s not- it’s like they randomly decide what’s offensive. Even when I censor my words I’m flagged. Rather than having an actual human review complaints their AI combs through and decides that things that are clearly meant as jokes (that no one reported and that everyone can tell is a joke) are terroristic threatening or leading to serious violence. Don’t even get me started on the “offending a group of people” offense when pointing out the apparent flaws of a group of people. There has to be THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS of average people on their restricted/ban list for saying things to their friends that we would say in everyday life, and if that doesn’t show an apparent fault in the system I don’t know what does. If my words are not actually harming someone (i.e. they weren’t reported), then I shouldn’t be receiving week long bans and 3 month long restrictions; that’s censorship for the sake of censorship rather than it being for the greater good. Meanwhile, I can casually watch people/animals being murdered in my Facebook video feed.

If ir was fake information how come Facebook wouldn't publish the facts of why and how they knew it was fake information. Also, a church in Goose Creek, SC was banned from Facebook. The church was never informed of what it did wrong. All the church did was stream their church services live on Facebook. The church tried to contact Facebook multiple times to find out what the issue was. Facebook never returned the church's emails. All the church asked for in the email was for Facebook to explain what they did wrong. Facebook never reinstated the church's account. Facebook is one more example of how we are losing our rights to free speech when we've done nothing wrong. It's all about control when you don't agree with their view. Facebook seems to disagree with Christianity. I hardly ever use Facebook anymore because of this. I use it when necessary to maybe put out a weather alert for people to be careful.
