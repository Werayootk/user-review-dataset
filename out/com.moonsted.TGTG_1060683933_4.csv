I appreciate the ratings, especially for the grocery stores, as I tend to assume they got rated harshly for expired items or poor value for the price.

A couple areas of potential improvement: I wish there were more stores near me. Most of the stores are coffee shops, so the food is primarily bread and pastries.

Another thing that would be nice is to be able to leave more information in the review and see other people’s reviews. However, I understand this might be hard to moderate. 

Really, I am just trying to get a general feel of what exactly I might be picking up (ex: croissants and muffins vs. more substantial food) and want to know if anyone got food poisoning or moldy food before.

My gripe is about notifications: I would love to know when things become available at specific stores, but this isn’t an option. Relatedly I don’t want notifications from places I haven’t designated as favorites. 
The new update seems to have removed information about when a place sells out their bags, which I miss as it helped me know when to check the app. 
Good luck to the app and developers and thanks for this pipeline",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-07T13:38:10-07:00

I just wish there were more restaurants!

In the app, the choices I get are not relevant to what I want. There is no phone number nor email that I can find on the website. This seems to be the only way to get a response.
My question is: can I only pick up food at the times shown? Or can I go at anytime once I place an order.
I have heard great things from people who have used the app and am eager to try it.
