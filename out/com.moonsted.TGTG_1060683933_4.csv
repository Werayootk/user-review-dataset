However in my experience using the app some businesses are essentially using the service to turn trash into profit rather than potential waste into a decent meal. Prices vary based on business some businesses charge $10 for literal scraps. There needs to be some sort of quality control or some sort of requirement. I shouldn’t have to toss out the food they give because it’s just inedible. We should be able to leave visible reviews on the restaurants we ordered from so there’s more transparency. After having 2 bad experiences in a row I cannot be the only one feeling like with the popularity of the app abuse is inevitable. If a visible review is shared on the app I think it would keep businesses more honest and prevent a bit of nonsense. I don’t expect the best of the best or an over abundance but I definitely don’t want to pay $5-10 then come home and throw away inedible food.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-18T20:15:15-07:00
