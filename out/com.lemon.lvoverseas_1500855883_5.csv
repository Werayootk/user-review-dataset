I was just working on something and then my screen went back to my home screen. i thought really nothing of it but then when i went back to finish what i was working on, it didn’t save!! that’s when i decided to say something about all the things that have been happening, so now i’m here. it was also telling me that i didn’t have enough storage, so i went and cleaned out a LOT of my storage that i didn’t need, and then it still said that! i think this might just be a glitch, so i’m going to go back to trying to figure it out. but otherwise, i can still do templates, so i guess that’s okay?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-13T16:48:06-07:00
9593897693,Artsy T 💕⚡️🫶🏾,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1404663600,7.6.3,5,Amazing app I love it,"Introduction: 

I love how easy it is to edit and how it’s mainly free. I’d recommend looking up some editing tips just for some extra help. 

Pros: 
There are literally so many pros here’s what I can think of: It’s free and it’s easy to edit. This is coming from an ADHD’er so yeah lol. 

Cons: I honestly can’t think of any (it’s that good I’m being honest). 

Editing things tips: 

I like to speed up songs so here’s a tip for this. Find a video or something of a song a screen record it (DO NOT CLAIM IT AS YOUR SONG IF IT’S NOT YOUR SONG) and record the certain part of the song (or the whole song if you want). I don’t recommend speeding it more than 1.3 because it will sound odd lol. Save the screen recording to your camera roll and allow CapCut to access your videos, pictures, screenshots, etc. There’s a button called “Extract audio” or something like that when you press on audio. It will send to you camera roll and you can get the certain screen recording of it. You can change the pitch of the audio (there is a pitch button that makes it sound sped up lol). Fonts and effects I use often: Auroal (probs spelt that wrong, sorry), Black Flash,  and Camera Shake. 

Final Thoughts: 

Get CapCut (or don’t I’m not your guardian lol) it’s literally so amazing. 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-07T13:05:07-07:00

I use this to create my videos for tik tok, and I’m sure lots of other people use capcut! Just a few things to fix. First, can you please fix the audio? By that I mean, in random parts of the when I check it, the audio will become off beat and I have to go back to the beginning and then it becomes off beat. That’s a bug that annoys me a lot. Next, this problem couldn’t be just me. Whenever I try the remove background, it acts super weird. I try to remove background for something and it doesn’t work so I try something else and when I remove background, it removes the background in the shape of the last thing I tried. It’s super annoying.

Because it maches so well for my video but I have to pay either monthly or yearly and I don’t have to waste my money on a editing app that I won’t probably use in the future and I really wanted to use for my video today but it was a pro.

But it’s a good app so the only thing that’s good is the other effects that not pro .oh and another thing I’m 12 years old living in a Mexican household so my parents won’t let me buy pro and I would recommend if you don’t have pro and let the effects be free because some people use this app and they don’t have a credit or debit card or their parents won’t let them buy stuff on apps so I don’t really like the pro feature they added…,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-28T13:02:14-07:00

I think the texts needs a bit more animations like vs but other then that you could consider them alike besides the less work. I think CapCut does need to let you do some of the work on your own, if that makes sense. CapCut is a good app for beginners, I think they should add stuff like making your own effect and what not, like how people will give you tutorials on flashing with the white overlays. I don't know why people think CapCut isn’t a good editing app, I think it may be the part where you don’t have to do much, as in you don’t put in much hard work.

First of all CapCut is what tons of FAMOUS roblox editors use for big parts of their edits. CapCut has a background remover, color option, caption effects and fonts, and a ton more that really help in editing. Second of all, I use CapCut a lot and it gets updated a ton, for example I go to the AppStore to go buy a new game, and I go check on CapCut and every time the button says UPDATE. And here are my suggestions. I think that the CapCut cut option could get the brush size a little bit smaller. I use it to remove my backgrounds and there is always some left.

It’s my favorite editing app, and i feel as if it provides the most freedom out of other apps that i have seen. However, I have two suggestions. One, when adding music, to be able to import from your device’s files. I save a lot of music as mp3s from an audio program, so i think it would just be a lot easier if there was one more way to import. Another suggestion I have is to be able to turn off snapping without exiting the editor. Maybe on the overlay screen, there can be a button near the undo-redo feature where you can turn snapping on and off.

I definitely recommend this for all ages because of how easy it is and how much work and time they put in to it, like how you have such a big selection of just effects, there is also many many transitions which make it cooler swapping with frames, you can add ANY song you want no matter how long/short it is.

It wouldn’t have been that bad if it weren’t for the fact that there was one effect I was looking for cause I needed it for the video, I don’t remember what it was called but basically it was in Lense, and it would make the center of the screen smaller and the outside larger, and it’s gone now. I’ve checked every single effect category multiple times but it’s just gone. Could you bring it back, and possibly add a search option so you can find effects easily?
Edit:
It turns out the reason I couldn’t find the effect is because you removed it’s name? It’s name is completely blank, maybe fix that, and again adding a search feature would make it way easier to find effects.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-25T09:53:56-07:00

I absolutely love this app. It’s the best and easiest editing app I ever downloaded. It makes it a lot easier for someone who barely knows how to do transitions. I don’t think I would change anything except one thing. So earlier I was making an edit for my fan page and I wanted to add a graph but it wasn’t letting me get any of the choices. Then I searched it up and saw that this option only works for androids which I don’t think is fair at all. Most people I know that have this is app is iPhone users, such as myself, don’t think it’s fair. So if it’s not too much trouble can you make it possible for iPhone users to use the graph option plus I updated the app and everything and it’s still not working.

I feel like CapCut is so easy to use though, like you can just put your clips in, cut them on beat, and key frames always help me a ton! Even though I was self taught how to use this app, it was honestly really easy to learn how to use it. Through these past 3 years I’ve improved so much, and I use CapCut to make edits almost everyday! So I recommend this app for anyone who wants to edit, but especially beginners!

If you're working on longer projects, or if you're adding a lot of effects, it struggles a bit to upload them. It glitches and lags here and there, but it's not too irritating. Another picky detail that annoys me a bit is that whenever you add text, it gives you tons of options for styles and effects, but it rearranges the places of the fonts each time, so you have go on a mini scavenger hunt to find the font you used yesterday. Again, that's me being picky. The rest of it is great! The app functions, it has never crashed, and there aren't any ads, even if you're using it for free.

And I tried to see if I could do 3D text and then I saw that ya’ll removed the 3D, but not the title, just everything in it. I was just wondering if you could put that stuff back? And also I came up with this idea that you can add effects over overlays? That would be really useful for beginners like me. Anyway that’s all I have right now!

I love how it is free and you don’t have to pay for anything inside the app. I have some suggestions though… I wish that when you are adding a clip and you go to the ones that are provided you can actually change the text like the sugar babe clip for example: you click on it and put it in your video but no one wants a clip that says”sugar babe” on it and they just want the fancy animation with the word that they want to put on it. I really hope you can change that up if possible. I also wish that when you select the neon  thing so it outlines people with neon in your video that it just outlines them and doesn’t have fancy words pop out and boxed text because it ruins the video.

For example: When on a bigger project I would try to zoom in and it would zoom in but go back to a fixed place after letting go making it impossible to get certain places without struggling, When i add some overlays it would glitch and put back all my overlays and make me have to manually put every overlay back into their previous position, and a slight bug thats been occurring is simply the project showing the wrong time when its longer or shorter

There are things that apps like alight motion and after effects can do that capcut can’t. I am mainly talking about shakes/transitions and quality, but mostly shakes. Capcut effects can be used for shakes and you can make pretty good ones but there is just something about alight motion and after effects that capcut just doesn’t have. I don’t know how to describe what those apps can do that this app can’t but if you look at edits that people made on those apps, I am sure you can see what is different. After effects has amazing quality that capcut just doesn’t have. If you search up after effects edits, I’m source you can see what I mean.

This app is really useful when I’m editing my animations, and it’s especially great because there’s no watermark. There are a few things I would suggest be added. First, there is no key frame and what I do needs key framing. Second, I wish there was a way to add more video layers without it having to be an overlay. Maybe it’s possible but I haven’t been able to so far. And lastly, I would recommend an effect or animation that is a slight camera shake (I don’t know how to explain it better).

These editors spend hours on end on their own edit and the transitions and making their edits perfect, and then it’s so easy for someone to steal it and make it their own and have millions of people use there hard work. Another thing is how I’ll scroll on TikTok and I see templates over and over and it’s becoming a trend.

I’ve tried to update and do everything I can, search on yt, it doesn’t work. Just please work on this it’s so annoying. Might be a bug but?

I use this app to edit multiple reels a day with subtitles, zooms, ect.  The time I’ve been doing this I’ve noticed features, that if they were added. Would improve my efficiency. 

Subtitles - The ability to choose a certain amount of characters per subtitle. A certain amount of words per subtitle. The ability to batch edit all the subtitles and put them all in CAPS. 

Buttons - making the touch/activation area of the play and pause button a bit bigger. It’s a little tricky to always click it the first time. 

Extracted Audio and video - The ability to be able to extract audio but keep it grouped together with the video it came from still. So you would be able to slide just the video and the audio would follow, but you can still see the audio waves. 

I appreciate any considerations into my preferences, and will continue to use the app regardless. I would be more then happy to see these changes in the future. It will genuinely help a lot of people out.

My favorite creator is 13, which is fine in my opinion, but it’s not what you guys requested. 2) You guys have giveaways, which I also love, but you need TikTok. It’s fine in my opinion because you guys own TikTok, but my parents don’t let me get TikTok (sorry I’m that child with those kind of parents).

If you are 18+ you can apply to post edits idk much about that process cause I’m not over 18. With those videos/edits you can use them with your own pics. You can also just create your own edits with any sound,pics,filters,ect. It’s really easy to use though once you understand what’s what and how to use it. One thing is though the comment portion of notifications, I was a little confused at first I thought it was like where you have in app private convos with people im still confused with that so yeah that’s the only complaint.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-25T15:44:13-07:00
