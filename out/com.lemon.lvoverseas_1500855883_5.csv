I lost my eldest sister (47 years old) one month after, my home, my dignity, and shortly after my sister-in-law (47 years old) succumbed to her battle with cancer.

 As you can imagine, not any human soul can withstand tragedy upon tragedy. I almost lost it a few times. 

I began feeling a kite-powerful source more powerful than anything I had experienced and it sunk me into the art world. I began discovering things I didn't know I could do.  

I'm not sure why or how I possess art but, although I've experienced damaging trauma this past year ART saved my life. 

This is the happiest I've been with something I do.  

Because of platforms such as cap cut, canvas, and tiktok I breathe air today.

Thank you for saving me! 

Your fan!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T07:39:56-07:00

Whenever there is an update and something is moved (for example when the chroma key got moved to background remover) I think it would be useful to say it where it was moved because sometimes it can hard to find them. Also, when looking for affects like transitions it’s really annoying that the capcut pro affects are mixed in with the free ones. It would be easier to find affects if there was a section with just the free ones so you don’t have to sort through all the ones you have to pay for.

I recommend CapCut to anyone. But for the text behind the object, please make it easier to make from the mobile app without first saving the already made one and bringing into the same video to put as a layer. Other apps I have used could easily do that from same app by duplicating the video part, removing the background then click on the text and position it behind the layered video and boom, text behind the object is made.

Also, please can you update the user interface with an automatic image adjuster? For example to position another image to fit into or align with another instead of using both fingers to do so. It's time-consuming and stressful.
