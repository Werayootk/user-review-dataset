I love good deals as much as the next person. But that being said, I donâ€™t love Shein or inexpensive things that fall apart after the first use. And with Shein, you get what you pay for: low-cost, trendy clothes that can be hit or miss when it comes to actual quality. Itâ€™s the online-only equivalent of mall stores like Forever 21 and Charlotte Russe. Iâ€™d recommend pieces shopped at Shein for those fun items you only plan to wear a handful of times, like a party dress or a graphic tee.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-15T07:00:14-07:00

11045474889,NeonRainbowz<3,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id236541154,10.6.2,3,Disappointing Service. No integrity.,"My first order of clothes was kind of a disappointment. One of the dresses I ordered was not made like the picture. It was actually a cheap material and came out ugly I couldnâ€™t even use it. 

Despite that I was actually excited for my bigger order that I recently placed. I had all kinds of items in my cart saved and some were in sale so I thought it would be the perfect time to get a big haul of things. I wanted to get things from clothes to household organizers, shoes, glasses, the whole shebang. So I actually ordered some organizers that were on sale to come in before my other items that I will be using it for. On top of ordering it first to ensure I get it on time I also used the â€˜expedite shipmentâ€™ option that was available. All was good for maybe a week. A few days after my order was approved it said it was shipped out to me and on its way. Well today I was very surprised when in my email I read that I had a refund that was approved and in progress. It was my organizers. After doing some reading on the site it said it was due to not having my item and they didnâ€™t receive a back up choice. Nobody ever sent me any notification to pick anything. I wasnâ€™t even notified that a refund was in progress, only after it was approved! How could it be due to no inventory if mines was shipped days ago with tracking information ?!? I am furious at the fact that I was checking everyday for updates on my shipment that was not even real?? How can I even trust the integrity of anything else on this site? So now here is my next issue, I got the items on sale which is why it was in my budget to buy. I am able to repurchase this item but not for the sale price anymore even though it wasnâ€™t my fault this whole refund issue happened. So basically SHEIN said screw you and thereâ€™s nothing you can do. I am very upset at this situation. Beware when buying on this site.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-14T19:53:11-07:00

Like a skirt that comes with a shirt etc. Iâ€™m a L/XL in my bottoms cuz my hips and bum.. then iâ€™m a S/M in tops. But when buying sets you are only able to choose one size. If i choose a large then the top will be way too big for me or a small or medium then bottoms will be too small. Please make it so we can choose the size of the tops AND bottoms,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-14T17:44:21-07:00
