For example, I got biker shorts at TJ Maxx for $15, and there is a pair on SHEIN that are very similar for $5. SHEIN also gives many opportunities to earn points and coupons to make products even cheaper! They have live streams every week where you can earn lots of points! And tune in to have fun! The outfits on SHEIN are so adorable and I’m ordering a bunch of clothes and outfits for my Youth Camp soon! You can also review products you have bought to earn points, and there is a free trial center where you can get free clothes and outfits! One final way I earn points is creating outfits on the app to win contests! If you want to check out my outfits my name is Lauren May.

I ordered $200 dollars worth of accessories. They shipped my package late. When the package got to USPS, The package never got delivered to me. I go to the post office to pick it up and they can’t find my package. They tell me to contact SHEIN. I contact SHEIN by virtual chat. They ask me if I want a refund or reorder. I let them know I want my order because I never received it in the first place and they had already taken out the money from my card. They place the order again and tell me that some of my items are out of stock so I have to take the refund. I explain to them how is that my fault if I didn’t receive the first package. Shein and USPS were giving me the run around. I ask them to accommodate me for the inconvenience and sent my package express shipping so that I can receive it and they told me no. I can just get my refund, that my refund will take 7-14 business days. What baffled me was they were quick to take my money, I still haven’t received neither one of my packages. I would never recommend nor shop on this app ever again.

When I received all the clothes none of it was true to size. One of the extra large T-shirts I got look like it would fit somebody who was a small and maybe a medium. The dress which I got as a plus size dress would never fit a plus size girl with large boobs or even big arms and I don’t even have big arms. Then my account was having issues going to an email I don’t have and I was getting no response from them and no help. I had somebody process my return and say I would receive a shipping label within 24 hours which I never received. I spent about $70 on stuff that doesn’t even fit me, and are sizes up that I normally wear in every other brand that fits fine. Also the clothes is extremely cheaply made and feels terrible. The best thing I bought was the cheapest thing I bought which was a butterfly clip.

Its easy to navigate and Ive ordered plenty of clothes, accessories, and other things from them by now and Ive been satisfied with almost all of my purchases, only dissatisfied with a few because I forgot to check the sizes.

The coupons are eh, theyre nice to have but tend to have limits to how much they take off, so like a 60% coupon for a $70 purchase will probably have a $20 limit to how much you save. Its not that bad though unless youre ordering a huge hall of things at once.

The point system is okay, it takes FOREVER to build up a bunch of points that are worth anything since one point is equal to one cent. Although you get points for writing reviews on your purchases, its hardly anything special unless you build up the points for a long period of time to spend all at once.

I usually buy clothes, so I cant say much for some other things, but some clothes I was pleasantly surprised with while others were pretty cheap feeling which is what I expect from how low the prices are, but theyre still nice and I have fun just scrolling through the app to see what clothes Ill buy next.

I didn’t even try them on, but come to find out lingerie is not returnable even if it does not match the listing . Wasn’t happy with my first purchase so I will not be ordering from this site again.. I have looked up the SAME exact clothes on other sites and most of it was way cheaper. It’s all coming from the same venders in China so shop around before you check out.

You learn what to get and what to leave alone after a little while, but it doesn’t matter much if you don’t like something or it doesn’t fit right because it is literally SO CHEAP. I will say that the clothes run extremely small. I always size up in everything. If you are plus size, they have stuff for that but you will definitely want to avoid the regular size stuff (sizes small to large, I mean). They have a VERY wide selection of swimsuits.

When I contacted customer support, the good thing is they responded quickly but the bad part was that they were consistent about every item was delivered. Oh and 1 dress that was delivered was the wrong size. The return prices for that dress was easy but for the items I never received- I never received a refund either.

After we received the first order, I waited to see how the clothes were after the first wash….it was great. We have received 3 orders since and I am about to place another before Christmas. My grandson loves SHEIN clothes.

We haven’t had any luck buying jeans that fit but I just give them to one of his friends. I guess the one thing I would like them to work on is an easier return policy. But the quality of their service, quick responses to emails, and clothing style and prices far outshine any complaints I may have.

It is easy to search for items and I appreciate how the site identifies items you select and finds you similar items. There are so many available options and a variety of choices. The prices are amazing. I haven’t had any problems with orders everything seems pretty true to size. Orders arrive in less than two weeks whether it’s regular shipping or Xpress. So far I have purchased almost 10 bathing suits all at under $10 for both a top and a bottom after discounts. They have items from baby sizes to adult and curvy. I just started purchasing some home items and I look forward to them expanding that department. They even remembered to offer items for pets of all kinds.

When some items come in, however ~ you can tell they were cheaply made, but when you put it on - it doesn’t make you LOOK cheap. I always feel so confident in all of the clothes I’ve bought from SHEIN. It also has an EXTREMELY easy to use app that almost doubles as a second Pinterest. You can make boards for different items you want to save to buy later, and SHEIN makes it pretty easy and fun to earn points for making posts and leaving reviews. This incentivizes other shoppers to leave reviews on items which always helps me decide what size would be best before ordering something. Lastly, You can get a lot for a little and the shipping time always arrives earlier than the stated dates.

The articles of clothing I received from Wish and Berrylook were literally unwearable and made for a great laugh on social media. 

However, I was crazy enough to try Shein after reading the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that their clothing actually is decent quality for the price and was presented accurately as pictured. The fabric was true to color and texture as pictured on the models. The sizing has been very accurate so far also.

Most of your models are around the size of 5’8” or so, even the plus size models. I stand for petite people, we can adjust our clothes, but it is annoying, liking one piece of clothes but seeing that even the smallest size doesn’t fit and it’s really upsetting, now imagine taller people. They can’t just add extra fabric to clothes unlike how plenty of us petite people who can just hem and sew our clothes. My point is, begin to normalize ALL types of bodies, not just plus size. Plus size people can also be taller or more petite. I believe that if I have a hard time finding clothes for myself as someone who is 4’10”, many others will too. If you want more people to buy your clothes, offer more sizes. 

Other than that, I can comfortably buy shirts and shorts sometimes too. I love your brand but please start creating long and petite sizes, we would all greatly appreciate it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-04T19:57:53-07:00

Their app is easy to navigate, and includes real people profiles. I love many of the features included within the app. The review system gives a good understanding of what the products comes out to be. I also adore the size chart, and the sizes are very detailed, giving an exact measurement. 

I suggest always looking over the reviews if you plan on buying from Shein. Although, majority of clothing items are great quality, some are deceiving. The reviews and size chart gives a good idea. There is usually 5-20 reviews per item, and it helps a ton. I always go through each one, to see whether I need a size difference, or even if I would like the material.

I love the kids section, as many other brands online don’t have a ton of clothes for kids unless they are a larger company. The clothes aren’t so girly and sparkly like some other stores, and really fits anyone’s style.

The fact that Shein offers accessories and add-ons is amazing as well! They are sturdy and very beautiful. I would just recommend that they were also sold in one pieces, since most come in bundles or bunches of jewelry. The bags are beautiful!

Overall, Shein is a lifechanger. Their clothing varies, but is fashionable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-17T15:13:52-07:00

Prices are great and budget friendly. Plus they partner with Afterpay and you can use it to make 4 payments on your purchase rather than dropping it all in one day! 

I had some clothes come in that were to big or to small so I did a return. I am not going to lie I was a little nervous to do it because I’ve heard good and bad but my experience was amazing!!

They allowed this new company to steal my package and made me wait another 10 days for nothing. The company noted my package was undeliverable because they couldn’t “find it in the warehouse”. SHEIN told me they had it and made me wait another 10 days when I asked over and over again for them to reship my stuff and have the people ship it back to them since I already waited 2 weeks. I waited a total of 3 weeks- 1 month just for SHEIN to refund my money when items are now out of stock and more expensive then when I bought them. Good customer service would’ve told them to resend the package and retrieve the package back from the fraud shipping company THEY HIRED. The shipping company had no way for you to contact them. It was a number on the site but they noted they weren’t taking calls and didn’t respond to text. Why would you hire a shipping company that you couldn’t even contact ?

I always liked SHEIN because they had one significant difference. Unlike fashion nova, SHEIN, had free exchanges and returns. SHEIN to me was like fashion nova but the reason I stopped shopping at fashionNova was, whenever I bought clothes that didn’t fit I was forced to pay for my return, which wasn’t always worth it. Unlike them SHEIN offered free returns and exchanges and I have been with them for years. This recent change in their return policy will lead me to delete this app. I found out from my brother who couldn’t return his package. He has stopped shopping from SHEIN.

Don’t get me wrong, the models are beautiful but not everyone is in size C bra types and average height. When I look for swimsuits I have to look to see in reviews if anyone more my size has posted a picture so I can see how it looks on a person who is my size. A lot of the clothing isn’t small enough so I have to pass on a lot of great outfits and swimsuits.

I spent the first year in the office rotating the same two pair of dress pants and about 5 shirts that i didn’t feel good in. I felt gross and frumpy, never put together…until I met SHEIN. Shein (and all the helpful customer reviews on each article of clothing) got me together! If you hit the flash sales and make use of the coupons, you could easily build a decent wardrobe for under 500$, whereas if you go to the mall, that 500$ isn’t going to get you much at all. I tell everyone i know about this website and app. I can’t believe i didn’t know about it sooner!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-10T05:45:11-07:00

When I try to buy from shops in person, however, just one cute top can be $20 to $40!! Shein is a place to get clothes at a cheaper price and be able to look at a variety of designs and styles. 
Yes, you may make a bad purchase sometimes but you have the option to return and all of the cute clothes you can get is so worth the occasional flop. It’s also free-shipping on Sundays, so I just build my cart during the week and buy on Sunday. 

I do want to say that newcomers should take care to actually measure themselves and look at size charts. I would suggest staying away from jeans and shoes (except maybe flip flops) on the site bc those are just the type of item that you should really try on in store before purchasing.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-02T06:12:49-07:00

I don’t usually right reviews about apps but I will for this one! All of there stuff is really good quality. When ording from SHEIN compared to other places they arrive a few days early or exactly on the dot. I’ve been ordering from them for a while now and I’m really please with the items, the response team when somethings not right or I just have a question there pretty quick with their responses. The app is also really user friendly.  SHEIN has a lot of things to offer, their point system is actually really cool! You can get them a whole punch of ways and you use them to take of amounts of moolah from your orders. You can get them by just checking in, spinning the wheel for points, giving reviews on anything you buy. The more more you write/ review the more points you get.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-25T08:48:28-07:00
