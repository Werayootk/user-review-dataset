I loved this app because how different it was from all the mainstream platforms that used “stories” as a concept but I never thought that Telegram will become one of those. 

I’d give everything for this feature to go. At least make a turn off button for stories because seeing them every time I go to the app starts to become unbearable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-16T11:36:51-07:00

I get barely 50 messages back and it automatically resets to the very end (last message sent). No matter how slow for it to load everything, or fast to get through it, it sends me right back. Sometimes I get lucky and get like a month and half back randomly, but not what I was looking for.  So the app does keep the chat history, but somehow you can’t look through it. What’s the point of having it id you can’t even go back to it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-27T16:58:19-07:00
8217759472,Kim Matos,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id316048730,8.4,1,SCAM,Be careful downloading this app as there is people on this app trying to scam others. There’s a “company” that will tell you to download this app for they can interview you but it is all a scam. They will offer to send you a check for you can buy “office supplies” for your at home office but then they will have you try to make a payment into a private vendor. Thankfully I was not dumb enough to fall for their little trap and caught them before they were able to send the “check”. Once you catch them in their scam they will delete the conversation on their end and it will also delete on your end for there won’t be any way to trace back to the conversation.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-08T04:53:55-07:00

It simply tells me that I have “No Conversations” I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app as well as restarts to both devices and running the app on my watch while I have Telegram open on my iPhone.  None of these things seems to do the trick.  I love using the WatchOS app to quickly send a sticker or view a chat history without needing to dig around for my phone.  It won’t work at all for me.

I’m subscribed to a few channels that have constant updates. One time I noticed that a couple of channels don’t display a number of new messages next to them, as if there were no new messages at all. When you open the channels only then it shows all the new messages and takes you to the very last one, so you have to scroll all the way up to find the first new message. This has been pretty consistent. 
App is updated, using iPhone 13pro",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-11T08:04:05-07:00

I really wanna clear some caches but since they were posted on a channel i can’t do it by deleting it . And i don’t want to clear some vids/files from the same channel so i can’t use clear cache on settings. 
I wish there was a way to clear those caches ( like , something like the delete button for pics and vids but to clear their cache , which would be really helpful)

Rather than having to forward many messages or send a-lot of messages to a bunch of individuals or make a group chat just to send a message.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-13T15:52:03-07:00

I'm asking Apple if that is in the App Store rules if not Telegram maybe kicked out of the store. Be aware of companies making bad decisions in coding apps hiring those who don't understand coding and UI and user interface. I am learning coding so I can see how poorly most apps are designed. Highly recommend looking for other apps not Telegram till they fix the mistakes. Everyone give 1 star review maybe Apple will notice it and Remove the app that way.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=686449807&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-03T10:49:19-07:00

It’s worth mentioning that Telegram unlike its fellows, WhatsApp in particular, doesn’t sell our data to corporations and governments. So I’m sure that my privacy is respected there.
