Snapchat is totally a safe and non toxic place if you use it the right way. A lot of parents say no to Snapchat for kids under 13, but I have some tips to help change your mind. 1. If your worried about snap map, one ANWSER. Ghost mode. It completely turns off your location for everyone! Super helpful for your child‚Äôs safety. 2. Snapping friends. If your worried about your child sending pictures to random people, you can simply ignore friend request you don‚Äôt know, and promise to only snap your friends! 3. Last thing, I promise. Not looking at spotlight page, or other stories. That is the only thing that could be toxic or appropriate thing on this social app. Overall, this app has no many highs, and very little lows! Hopefully this was very helpful, download Snapchat today!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-14T18:21:53-07:00

I still love this app a lot but the updates are soooo bad. First, I will start off with the bitmojis, now they look more ‚Äúhuman like‚Äù it is very scary and I liked the way it looked before. Another thing I don‚Äôt like about new Snapchat is that there are no games. I literally loved Snapchat games and all of my friends loved it as well. The last part of Snapchat updates that I find so dumb is Snapchat plus. I get that it can help you get more money but it is so annoying to me. It gives them the ability to do many things that just doesn‚Äôt make Snapchat the Snapchat that I enjoy being on. Half swiping is apart of privacy and I would like it to stay that way so it‚Äôs very infuriating that it‚Äôs now alerting you when I do it. Other than these bad updates there are many things that I think you are doing well like keeping the app relevant and all the new filters.

They used to be fun, unique and appealing and now the 3D ones look so incredibly cheap and low effort. I refuse to update just so my stickers are still 2D. The 3D models for the bitmojis are awfully UGLY. Whoever decided that this was a good idea, please leave the UI design department or whichever department decides this change. Bring back the old designs and get rid of the 3D garbage. No one asked for it. Please and thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-28T19:26:24-07:00

Let me talk about how horrible those spotlights are because a girl could literally post a video of herself and get bashed and harassed in the comments with sexism and guys sexualizing her it's honestly disgusting and i really believe they should delete spotlights from how horrible and harming it is plus the fact that mostly children use this app and are easily subjected to random strangers at least they could have an addition where you can turn off spotlights AT A MINIMUM. Oh and the snap + is just horrible ever since you guys turned the beautiful bitmojis this putrid 3D model i've hated it and wanted to take off my bitmoji SINCE because of how disgusting and man like it makes my female bitmoji appear. I honestly dislike this app with all my heart compared to how it used to be just last year.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-12T14:35:42-07:00

You‚Äôre able to FaceTime, Message, and Voice call and you can even have fun with the filters. The downside though is the bitmojis, the way they look now doesn‚Äôt look good at all. I think the the old bitmojis looked way better than the ones we have now. Honestly, I don‚Äôt get why you added the realistic ones when the old ones were just fine. You should make it to where if you want the realistic look then you can enable it in your settings just like we did for dark mode. Same for the AI too some people don‚Äôt really like the AI and wanna get rid of it. I also think you guys should add the games back too though because the games were pretty fun to play with friends and I believe that‚Äôs why most people have gotten the app. But no hate goes to you guys because this app is still good it‚Äôs just the recent updates you‚Äôve done I just kinda find off.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-09T22:23:55-07:00
10470696748,Hip Hip Haraaaaa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1297164473,12.55.0.61,2,Alien mojos look so dang ugly,"I loved snapchats 2D life. The 2D bitmojis were the best. And now all of a sudden these horrendous 3D models came along. And they REVAMPED the 3D models. And now when u customize them they avatars look so DEFORMED like a little kid designed the body. What made me upset is the profile pictures. 2D was the best. 3D was meh, but 3D revamped is so freaking terrible. My question is why? Why are you guys changing the models? Are you guys getting sued or something?? Literally every app that is being updated is taking away the key points that makes their app original and good. They should give us to option to do 2D or 3D. Knowing well majority of us will choose 2D. And Today, October 13, 2023. My friend just got another unnecessary update. When you tap to view peoples storys, you have to SLIDE DOWN like you would do on tiktok and insta reels. Like c‚Äômon ik im sounding extra but this is so unnecessaryüò≠The reason y i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 is because you can pay to revive your streaks. That is the only good update they did in my opinionüòÇ",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-13T12:44:24-07:00
10384430523,MrAmmar25,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id452885106,12.52.0.46,1,Snapchat or trash-chat,"I somehow got device banned and it‚Äôs been 6-7 months I still haven‚Äôt been able to use my account, I don‚Äôt recommend snapchat but my team and I will be creating an app 500x better than snapchat and that‚Äôs a guarantee. The TOS are vague, I did nothing wrong and support never helps I‚Äôve contacted support many times but PART OF THE TOS is that you can‚Äôt have two accounts and I had one personal account as well as a business account which one of them got banned besides that I was not scamming as I run a legitimate business so it‚Äôs hilarious to see how I can still log into my account that was not banned on other devices as in my old 13 pro max but not my current 14 pro max it‚Äôs absurd and Snapchat needs to fix this ASAP, I doubt they will but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a MAC address ban or a device ban via IMEI. Due to this issue my team and I are in the works of a snapchat competitor we have just started working on it about a month ago and hopefully soon to release the beta version. If all goes well I‚Äôm sure we will surpass Snapchat in users and revenue.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-19T05:33:42-07:00
9847624951,Unsafe update,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1521276460,12.30.0.42,1,Unsafe Update,"I have used snapchat since 2018 and loved that app for many years. But the updates keep getting worse. The new update called MyAi. At first I was i interested until i realized it is a bot that is getting information. I started talking to it and I was curious so I asked, ‚Äúwhere do I live?‚Äù It told me what state and city i live in. This response left me absolutely terrified. It then explained that I had mentioned it in our previous conversation, which was not true. Is this what snapchat has turned into? A app that was once a fun filter communication app to an unsafe app. My 14 year old daughter had shown me that her Ai on her phone had told her that it was a real person and they should meet up. I took her phone and went along with it to see how far this bot would go. It began to explain that it would meet her at a park near our house. I could not believe it. I tried to somehow un add this bot. But you cannot delete these hacking bots. Snapchat, i'm disappointed and sad how you turned a fun app into a app you need to be cautious about. Give us our old snapchat back now.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-21T21:27:52-07:00
