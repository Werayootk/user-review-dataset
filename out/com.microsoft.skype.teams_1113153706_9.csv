Problem 2 appears when I can see all 4 options. One is “call me” so I hit that. But then I need to select my number to call and I then get a call, so I answer the call and it tells me to press “1” if I want to join the call. Then I have to find the dial pad and press “1”.  Biggest problem is that the dial pad doesn’t recognize me pressing “1” so I am unable to join the call. It simply asks me again to press “1” even though I have already done that.

After it happened a second time, I approached the office about the problem and stated I was concerned about privacy, others seeing the video and HIPAA. Shortly thereafter I received a letter dismissing me from the clinic. lesson learned, dont complain about privacy concerns unless you plan on leaving your physicians office permanently. But I will no longer use teams in any sort of video chat situation because I do not trust that the videos are private and the extreme, defensive nature of the medical facility also leads me to believe they had concerns of legal liability.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-22T22:24:27-07:00

3693442990,FutballNic,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id288225776,1.0.64,5,A great collaboration tool and step away from email clutter,"So far, teams has become a great platform for my team to work on projects, host daily meetings - where my team comes prepared due to the group accountability that Teams provides - and as a general chat functionality.  I like the app, and i love the ability to move all of the software I use that is secure and approved with our infosec team.  

Some interface improvements could be that when you work on a Team PowerPoint, the slides can be small due to margin layout.  There is a little bit of lag on what other team members are doing in a document, so you need to have a few seconds, sometimes a minute of patience if collaborating on a document.

Overall, very impressed and I recommend this.
