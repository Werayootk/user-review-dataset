You can read something, or even worse, you can write something, then you switch for a split second to another app, e.g., to check something or to copy-past something and it restarts, and you has to manually find the place where you was.

It also checks a message read, once it appears on the screen, not when your scroll to its end. As the result the once the messenger restarts, and you find channel on which it has stopped, you need to scroll back. Also, if there was only one unread message in the channel, aster restart the channel is marked completely read which makes it more complicated to find.

But this app is different. I have had some issues and tried to reach out the the technical support team yet I have yet to hear from them and it has been over a week. If you have any problems know that your pretty much S.O.L. Because nobody will contact you nor can you contact anyone.
