Don‚Äôt get me wrong, mobile is great, but there is an issue I need to address. You see, I turned on captions for a video ONCE, but the always show captions somehow activated after I did that. I don‚Äôt want captions on every video, only that one, because sometimes a youtuber will include extra dialogue in the captions. The only tutorial for turning off always show captions is on the desktop version, which has a different settings layout from mobile. I tried using my web browser‚Äôs ‚Äúrequest desktop site‚Äù but it will just automatically enter the app when I click on the link. Yes, I can manually turn off captions on every video I click, but that gets really annoying.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-14T17:37:27-07:00"},{"id":"5978420665","userName":"Jack.Hedg","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id750513060","version":"15.20","score":2,"title":"Something Happened","text":"I was like addicted to this app and now the comments are moved up which btw ruins half of the videos I watch for spoilers just something there, it‚Äôs getting very slow for me and Ik it‚Äôs not my connection because we just moved into a big city and all of my friends say it isn‚Äôt working for them but some are saying it is, there are a lot of bugs in this and it just drives me crazy and insane to thing that a platform with this many downloads would have so many bugs especially during this time, the ads want me dead and want to steal my money like they are just around like absolutely around and I can‚Äôt watch three videos in a row without getting at least two of the same ad, and finally it‚Äôs saying that there‚Äôs something wrong with it and that I am expose to pay for it?!
