The continuous improvement of the apps is great too as well. 
So many new features added and so on.
Nevertheless there are other great things that are being taken a way from the apps that need to be reconsidered for great and greater experiences. 
Not sure if it’s a bug that would be fixed or deliberately done.
Few things I noticed are;
1) The inability to fast forward or rewind voice messages.
This is very handy function as sometimes we just need to quickly get a point from a voice message we have previously listens to and so on. 
2) When viewing status that has audio we have the ability to increase the audio by using our phone volume keys and able to set it to the desire volume. But now it’s volume is static once you push the button at the start of the status it added audio that can neither been increased nor decreased. 

Please try to look into this as it’s embarrassing having your phone on highest volume in public places and be unable to adjust it. 

Am using an iPhone 8 Plus incase these issues are only on certain devices.

When user wants to open a specific chat from locked chats, only for that chat app should present an unlock option and let the user enter the pin/ lscan face ID.
 3. The locking chats feature is good, but released prematurely it seems. Please improve this feature.

Tried this on more than one device where I‘m using what’s app (and no contact access granted).
