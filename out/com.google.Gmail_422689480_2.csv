My Inbox widget broke and was completely blank, though tapping it would still take me to my inbox. A restart of my phone and replacing the widget fixed it from being blank, but now the emails shown on the widget don’t update. Additionally, the banner notifications for new emails suddenly don’t show a preview, they just stare that I have a new message. This is despite my settings allowing previews. I'll try another restart of my phone and reinstall of the app, but the bugs are making an otherwise great app frustrating. Hopefully the team fixes the bugs soon so I can make this a 5-star review.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-26T11:59:30-07:00
