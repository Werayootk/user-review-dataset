I recommend this app for content creators. And it has the features that make my videos twice as more entertaining. And I recommend this app because it’s better than kienmaster and other editing app I’ve used and less complex. Although, there are two issues, when I often export my videos, (reminder that this happened yesterday and today) I wait so long for it to finally export just to have the exporting process fail. Not only the slow exporting is an issue but it says that my storage is too much and I thought my storage was the case. And I started deleting unwanted apps to save storage to only experience the same issue AGAIN. I have has less GB of storage yet it asks me to try again or whatever. All I know is that this issue never seemed to happen to me when I used the app the day before yesterday please fix the exporting issue. I would rate it 5/5 if you could.

Now, i started making an edit and the heart text wont go away. (The two edits are completely different.) Now when i try to play my edit, there is a <3 in the middle of my clips. I cant make it go away and i have no idea whats happening. I even tried to change the text but thats not working either, the heart is permanent. Thats the only downside about mine.\n\n\tBut, you know after effects right? Well, I’m on a mobile device so i dont have after effects. But, when you add key frames on after effects, you can do a graph as-well the graphs make the key frame animations much much smoother. (I know this by watching ae/after effects edits).

I have deleted apps and important videos and pictures only for it to tell me that my storage is full. Also, I was wondering if you could fix the audio problem… Every time I export a video, the audio is a bit ahead of the actual video. Also, maybe you could add element 3d. Capcut keeps crashing when I’m exporting in 2k-4k quality. I absolutely hate  Capcut pro though.

Another concern i have in this topic is when I make animations theres always a blue line which means I cannot freely animate or move anthing around.

I dont know if it can be fixed or dealt with, but i like the cover filters i plan in another program and would wish that it can transport the same effect in capcut","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-20T23:21:23-07:00"},{"id":"10803446654","userName":"kaleedjsmith","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1327012104","version":"10.7.0","score":2,"title":"Frustrated aggravated and disappointment","text":"This is a total waste I deleted programs off my laptop for this none working crap.. record a video and the cap cut is not only extremely laggy no matter what I do the music will not match with the video it plays part of the music The cursor isn’t even on it’s extremely frustrating I sometimes want to throw my laptop to the wall I’m going back to Sony Vegas pro… this is a total upset Top review was of the desktop version this review is about the mobile version.

One thing I really think capcut should improve is their animations, they're really basic and stuff, but that’s in my opinion. I would also like if they can make everyone post their templates for a few while without having to do phone numbers and stuff because I as a user would really love that! The best thing about capcut and why you should get it is the effects, The effects are so good! It helps me with my edits and the best effect i would recommend is the astral. The astral effect really reminds me of a ghost effect you can get in aftereffects. That’s all i have to say but overall it’s so amazing…i would recommend getting this app if you are really interested on editing stuff.

In the app, the audio is synced up perfectly to the video, all cues on point. But once it’s saved and I look at it, it’s always about a second off and then I have to adjust the audio and save it without the proper syncing so that when I watch the video on my camera roll, it will be synced. \n——————\nAlso I don’t like how if I’m listening to music on my phone, the app automatically pauses my music even if the video I’m editing had no audio.

I got again recently like 1 month ish ago. and I was surprised to say it had gotten worse. I was shocked to see \"Capcut pro\" and tutorials, and templates; they are completely useless for other than maybe an idea or most likely an audio. You can't click one drop-down menu without seeing something about pro. And with the limited about of overlays it makes it hard to make an actual edit. I would ramble more but I don't want you to think this is a bad app. The layout is actually really good and it's very easy to navigate especially for a beginner.

The only thing that kind of annoys me is that it only goes up to 3 minutes when you are making a video on camera. I wish you could go longer because that would really take the stress off of being like, “ahhh!! I only have 10 seconds left!!!” But I do really like how they have templates you can watch AND you can use the templates to create your own video!! Me and my cousins love watching funny videos on templates, and that is one thing I would NOT change.

I also wish that they add more filters, meaning that you don’t have to work super hard and make multiple edits just to add a cool filter. Also, I wish they had a few more audios that could fit with “trends” I guess. I make anime edits a lot so more of a variety of audios would be amazing.

They added a lot of new and cool features and don’t get me wrong I love them but the new template feature is going to get out of hand soon. Many people on tiktok have threatened to sue CapCut for stealing edits with the template feature, and the CapCut community hasn’t stopped stealing yet. They go on tiktok and take the edit and make it into a template and they remove the watermark, I’m addressing this because a very popular editor made the ‘video game lover’ trend and it blew up all over social media, a few weeks later her exact edit was turned into a CapCut template and people were claiming the edit to be theirs. I know Lauren/ emo from whoville and she spends a lot of time on her edits for them to just get stolen. CapCut needs moderators or some type of moderation if you want to stop this app from actually getting sued or worse?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-26T15:29:06-07:00"},{"id":"10516902259","userName":"😑hubum","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1389740112","version":"9.6.1","score":5,"title":"It’s a great app but mine glitched","text":"Hello! I am a bigggggg fan of capcut I love it it’s kinda like TikTok but anyways as you can see on my title it glitched so let me explain a couple of days ago I wanted to go on capcut and make a funny video for my friends I was about to click the button that says “ start edit” so I clicked it but it said I needed my photos to be allowed but I’ve had this app for about a year so I go into settings to allow photos but there is no photo button so I check if capcut needs an update and it dose so I updated it and when I went into the app again I clicked the “start edit” and it said you need to allow photos and I thought I needed to do it for the update so I look in settings and there isn’t a photos icon so I deleted capcut and got the app again said the same thing so I love the app but I don’t know what’s happening to mine but thank you for reading this!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-26T04:07:51-07:00"},{"id":"9028612140","userName":"Lolloler123","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id736076691","version":"6.6.0","score":4,"title":"Great but could use some fixes","text":"I’ve been using CapCut since I first started editing. Sure I’ve used videostar or alight motion here and there but it’s always been CapCut. And I have to say, it’s amazing. It’s great, simple, and easy to use but I feel like there could be more added to it. The new update with the motion blur is awesome, and that fixed a lot of my problems but a major problem I have right now is the quality and timing of the videos. I’m currently editing as I’m typing this but it is being extremely laggy compared to when I first started. It was fine at first but now I can’t even tell if the timing is right because it keeps glitching. The clips were timed perfectly to the audio but I can’t tell anymore. Another problem with the timing is when I finish an edit, everything is perfect until after I export it and view the video in my photos, then the timing is off again. \nI’d just say fix those problems and it’s perfect.👍","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-08-28T21:12:37-07:00"},{"id":"10144357050","userName":"this is offline","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1180597365","version":"8.7.1","score":5,"title":"Review but auto-correct types it 😃✨","text":"So this is a good way to get a good idea of what you want to do with your time and effort and then you can start working on it and then you can get started with your project and then you’ll get a better understanding of how to get started with your projects so that when you’re ready you have something that you’re really interested to work with so that you’re able and not have a bad experience in your projects and then you’re just getting to work with them so that they don’t get to work on them or something that they can get started on them or something that they don’t want to work on your project that way they get to know what they’re doing so you don’t get to do what they’re working on them or you can do what they do it and then you get a little more than what they can help them and you get to work with you.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-15T13:30:52-07:00"},{"id":"10316831623","userName":"Ella hcjvh","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id702491935","version":"9.0.1","score":5,"title":"I love this app so much!","text":"This app is so easy to use. All you have to do is screen record a video in Roblox or in any kind of thing and then all you have to do is search whatever edit you want up it’s just such a good app. I love it. I hope it never gets updated because it’s so good how it is right now I’ve been making so many good edits on there. Sadly, I cannot sign up though because I’m not old enough but I have made a very good progress with this app. I hope all of you read this because it’s such a good app. You should totally download it. It’s such a good easy app to use but with editing you don’t have to do anything else I mean you can make your own edit with it, but I kind of don’t use it because I kind of don’t know how to use it but for all those people who seen this app and I want to download it you should you really should OK just download it.

I use this app and have primarily been editing on it for 2 years, but I don’t know if I’m lagging or something but, did you actually make the fade in effect a PRO FEATURE? I love this app and I just think such a simple effect isn’t worth that, I also think you should make a version of the ripple distortion effect for a loop text. And like the actual effect, don’t make it a pro feature as I feel that would be un fair, since it is just a different version of the original effect.. but I do love this app and it is all I use for editing, I just think it could improve a little bit, there is so many things I love but also can’t assure are the best things, so many things are missing from CapCut which could truly make it this best editing app for mobile, I had gone through multiple to find this app, I rate it a 5 stars but CapCut, what?!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-05T08:39:06-07:00"},{"id":"10589000072","userName":"feebomeebo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1423706892","version":"9.9.0","score":2,"title":"I’ve loved this app for years but it has betrayed me","text":"Two stars because I’ve been using this app as my primary editing app as I’ve been learning how to edit videos, but only two because today when I tried to export a video I spent a few days working on, the app told me I was using a pro feature and wouldn’t let me.\n\nI was confused because I always make sure to not use any and check all my effects and such before I select them. The app told me that the glitch: by word text effect was a pro feature and I was shocked. I went back into my edit and found the effect but there was no pro icon next to it.\n\nReally confused now, I looked up online to see if anyone was having the same issue and found forums months old of people saying they had also spent days working on edits and then got paywalled while trying to export. \n\nSeeing that this isn’t a sudden or new problem, it feels intentional that a popular effect like a glitching text effect is locked behind a secret paywall which people will only discover once they’ve put their hard work and effort into their edits.\n\nI myself have been working for about 3 days on this edit which heavily used the glitching text effect. I’d have to go back and basically scrap the entire thing. \n\nI have nothing against people who buy and use pro features or the selling of pro features, but something like this should either be fixed ASAP if it’s a genuine mistake, or capcut has really gone down hill with such a scummy marketing strategy.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-11-15T10:58:22-07:00"}]
