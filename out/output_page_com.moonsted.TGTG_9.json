My first order after driving all the way over there, the woman gave away my food. My second order at a grocery store was nothing but rotted produce, and a loaf of bread that was so hard I could‚Äôve busted a car window with it! There was mold on the vegetables! And the greens would‚Äôve totally had you in the bathroom for hours if you ate it.

For such a low cost compared to delivery/pickup apps like doordash or uber eats, this offers that same feeling of a take out bite for a fraction of the cost.
