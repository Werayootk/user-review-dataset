My 9 year old has dyslexia and learns slowly they have accommodated him so that he’s catching up, and will hopefully be on grade level soon. I have the amazing staff to thank for this!!

Right now as i’m writing this review were covered in 2 feet of snow, so it’s pointless in winter, (unless you get no snow) but in summer it’s pretty useful. It also helps me out with geography, which is a subject I study a lot. Finally I like looking in on river valleys. It’s really easy to scroll down a river valley and see where it leads to.

The navigation also tends to overuse “keep straight” instructions, especially in spots where it is obvious that the driver should continue straight… like on a highway where you need to lane change onto the exit ramp lane.

This has also been a long-time issue, but the nav will also not add in a turn instruction occasionally despite being a full stop sign and obvious turn, though this usually occurs only at specific T intersections from specific directions (usually the “stem” of the T).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2023-01-21T08:12:21-07:00

I don’t know what they changed in their algorithm, but since they changed it there has been a noticeable uptick in Los Angeles traffic. Everyone I know who uses Google maps has said that it it took a nose dive recently.

In the stupid thing is, whenever you bring this up with support, they always say that traffic is unpredictable and they do the best they can.

The only problem with this, is that if the traffic was truly unpredictable, then why does the ETA always go up, and never down?

It’s because their algorithms VASTLY underestimate traffic. Their algorithms are what is off here. I’ve been using google maps for years and it’s only been in the past several months it’s turned into probably the most frustrating thing I’ve ever had to deal with.

I don’t even want an ETA anymore. It’s useless. Why have an eta if you’re always just going to show up 10 minutes late to everything anyways? 

At what point will the “Traffic is heavier than usual” traffic become normal since it says that every SINGLE time I go anywhere.

Normally I’m very happy with the app, but suddenly it’s asking me to rate how happy I am with the app at the exact moment I’m arriving... if the address is down the street, fine - I have a chance to memorize the house number before google wants to be rated, but often, the address I’m looking for is immediately on the last turn, so google asks for a rating before it’s even given me the address, leaving me absolutely stuck! I have to pull over so I can go back and look at the exact address I’m looking for. I’m sorry, but rating google at that moment is not my primary interest, but finding the address is! If I rate it at that moment, I’ll give a zero out of sheer frustration! Do I need to use a different app for navigation all the way to my final destination??? Please tell me how to opt out of rating - I want to rate at my own convenience and choice, not google’s!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2020-02-04T15:13:19-07:00
