The app is terribly coded, the keyboard cursor randomly jumps to different lines when trying to type listings, notifications remain for hours when you‚Äôve already clicked on them, automated support issues are frequent and incredibly hard to work with, contacting support is near impossible and always unhelpful. They withhold money from the seller inconsistently and withhold shipping labels making it extremely hard to comply with their shipping policy. Their automated ‚Äúauthenticity checks‚Äù take hours instead of minutes like the app claims. Their copyright policies are the worst. I can‚Äôt upload pictures with backgrounds removed or they get taken down DESPITE ALL THE PHOTOS BEING ORIGINAL PICTURES TAKEN BY MYSELF!! I‚Äôve tried to explain to support I do this for my own comfort and safety and they gleefully told me it didn‚Äôt matter, they would to continue to take down my listings, and tell me I would be banned.

I tolerated this until someone stole 20‚Ç¨ from me and deleted their Vinted account.

Even as a seller, people refuse to buy through the app and they want to make an informal sale through PayPal as well.

A little over 2 weeks ago vinteds shipping went up to $6.92 for small packaging, $12.92 for medium packaging and $15.92 for large packaging! Which is outrageous considering their original prices were $3.99, $6.09, & $9.15. I get that it‚Äôs expensive to ship with the post office now, but other selling apps are at this point are way cheaper to buy with. And, get this, the shipping prices went back to their original price like maybe a week and a half ago. I woke up this morning and started scrolling and discovered that the prices went back up to $6.92, $12.92, and $15.92, no warning whatsoever, nothing. Not to mention their customer service is terrible, 1/3 times I get a response when I have an issue. When vinteds shipping prices are down I absolutely love Vinted, but with the high shipping prices now, and terrible customer service I‚Äôll be taking me business elsewhere :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-19T08:28:35-07:00

Occasionally I have purchased items not as described, and fortunately for me, it has worked out in my favour, but only because the sellers have made it right. However, I have had to contact support at time or two, this last time being yesterday (06/06/23). The seller short changed the order (messaged me they could only find 7 of the 8 I purchased) and decided to ship it without me responding‚Ä¶not only did they make that assumption/decision, the ones sent had holes in them, smelled foul and were completely discoloured. Then the seller admitted to all the discrepancies and said, ‚Äúyou bought them, it‚Äôs your fault‚Äù, ‚Äúif I washed everything I sold, would it be worth selling‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs still a good deal‚Äù. I asked for Vinted for assistance to obtain a refund and they basically send, pay to return the order and only receive that subtracted balance as a refund‚Ä¶.mind you buyer‚Äôs pay a ‚Äúprotection‚Äù fee with each purchase. I asked about the protection I paid for and their response was it‚Äôs to protect the seller‚Ä¶and give the a safe place to sell on their platform. So with all the proof and admittance of wrongdoing by the buyers and as the buyer rudely told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs on [me]‚Äù. I will be returning the order at the lost and count it as a small lesson learned. If I could not be supported over the small amount spent, there is no way I would be protected over a larger amount (I was eyeing a ¬£500 purchase). I will be deleting the app and sticking to eBay where is it safe for both the seller and buyer.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-06T22:48:53-07:00

I‚Äôve been getting offers lately but no one is buying because they don‚Äôt have to - even after they made and submitted their offers and I, a seller accepted it! It‚Äôs frustrating how unorganized this app is! I‚Äôve been using Vinted since they first started and haven‚Äôt sold anything in over 3 years because a lot of these people are FLAKES! 
Please fix this! When people send offers they are obligated to buy so people stop playing games with sellers. It‚Äôs so annoying!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-06T20:19:12-07:00
