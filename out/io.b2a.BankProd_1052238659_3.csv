I don‚Äôt know why they took away the graph that shows your spending over the month and where you could scroll back and see the amount you had at any point in time. That was one of the best qualities. Also the international money transfer experience is annoying as you always have to add the international recipient over and over again, they don‚Äôt let you save.

The app is very user-friendly, making it easy to figure out what you spent where. 

My biggest frustration is that it‚Äôs easy to for money requests to get lost in the shuffle. Either you send your request in a text (with no proof but the message that will inevitably be buried in the rest of a conversation), or in some cases the request will appear with the rest of your spending (but again, if you don‚Äôt repay the person right away, it might get buried in your other transactions). It would be great to have a separate window showing outstanding requests to/from other Monzo users. 

I also wish there was a way to easily find your total spending from a certain slice of time, as right now you can only do it by month.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-11T12:40:57-07:00
