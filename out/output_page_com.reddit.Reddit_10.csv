Of course, while some may believe that having what may be designated as “hate” subs gives hate an opportunity to latch onto others and grow, I feel the opposite; I think hate subs CONTAIN hate. Even if they aren’t quarantined...

Designated groups for “hate speech” allows hate to be contained and documented... it serves as a learning tool for others to understand hateful viewpoints, how they come about and how they can be changed.

The He Gets Us ads, funded by the people behind Hobby Lobby, purport to promote Jesus and Christianity in a manner that is blatantly hypocritical. These ads cannot be blocked or downvoted. The user account posting these ads can be blocked but doing so does not prevent their ads from continuing to show up. Reporting them does nothing. They are the only ads where such actions are fruitless. And they appear over and over again, dozens of times in an single hour, even showing up on subs (such as those concerned with religion/church-based trauma) where such messaging is wildly inappropriate and unnecessarily triggering to folks who have come to Reddit to for peer support. And the ads appear on subs dedicated to non-Christian religions, which is light years beyond ‘tone-deaf’.

This is obviously a not-at-all veiled attempt by a Christian evangelical organization to evangelize on the platform. And, because of the ubiquitous ads’ persistence in the face of downvotes, reporting, and blocking, Reddit is just as complicit. Together they are angering, triggering, and retraumatizing many users and they know it. It’s easy to see that the advertising campaign is targeting vulnerable groups and that is beyond disgusting.

However, FB also does those thing fairly well, but posts there have a longer interest life, are easier to reference (FB still isn’t good at this though) and allow for more in depth discussion.

One way reddit could improve is to cut down on the amount of comment tiers possible to just two, like FB. Post, comment, and replies to comment. That’s it.

Also, the vote system shouldn’t weigh so heavily on order of comments. Involve reply counts into the equation. 

I would love a way for Reddits to be able to branch into subreddits with no ability to post on the reddit itself. This allows more precise organization about topics of a topic. This is one place where forums shined.

Obviously this system will probably never reach the reference utility that forums had. But as one of the two primary platforms that have replaced forums I can only hope that it does. The automotive enthusiast community needs a proper replacement for traditional forums.

I can’t vote because it “failed.” Trying to see comments on a video post while trying to pause it seems to be a battle. Either you read the comments while the video is playing, or you close the post since the gestures are too sensitive. The feed always shows me content I saw days ago, and refreshing it updates it with content I saw hours ago. Also, if you use a VPN, you will automatically have a subpar experience since they would rather degrade the connection quality than impact their precious ads.

Reddit is no longer the grown up version of 4Chan, it’s a legitimately run business and powerful instrument for media presence across the world.

It’s almost like they don’t want you to enjoy what you like about their service.

What’s worse is how clunky the app is anymore. The processing it forces on my phone bogs it down to unusable. I used to see this in other apps if I spent too long on them. But this app gets clunky within the first few minutes. If I switch out of Reddit, the phone and other apps function normally. Switching back to Reddit, it’s slow and glitchy.

And you can also talk to Rick Astley himself if you want, he browses Reddit as well. Can’t say he’ll see you though.

My only issue with the app is that when the page says “REFRESH” at the top, hitting the button only reorganizes it. This isn’t an issue for the website on PC, but it’s annoying, due to the fact that I’ve already seen the post. Nothing is new.

Using Reddit on my phone for the past few days causes my phone to get hot, really hot, and the battery drains rapidly. I have never had this issue before.

The new video player seems to have been designed by the B or C-team. The slider is so close to the bottom of the screen that the phone thinks you are trying to perform some iOS gesture. The slider is effectively useless now. 

My question is why did the slider have to change? What is Reddit’s testing strategy? How did this make it out of QA?

As for draining my battery, it effectively applies a physical limit to the the amount of time I can spend browsing Reddit. Probably a good thing for me but not for them.

Why doesn’t selecting “open” from the App Store take me to the link I originally selected?
