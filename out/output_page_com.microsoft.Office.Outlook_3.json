I kept getting password error messages and occasionally connected email profiles would disconnect and the problem would start all over again. For no reason that I could fathom, the exact same credentials (pasted) would then suddenly start working again. This seems to have settled down now and things are working as they should. \n\nAt first the interface seemed clunky but after getting used it it feels very efficient. \n\nPros: \nSpam control!\nMy biggest complaint against Apple’s mail app is complete lack of spam recognition. No matter how many times you junk spam emails, the same stupid emails keep showing up in the inbox several times a day. Blocking senders is pointless because every junk email has a unique sender. The Outlook app did away with most of them after just one junking session! Sweet!\n\nFunctionality\nAlthough the app takes a little exploration to find where things are and how they work, it has many of the bells and whistles of the desktop app. \n\nCons:\nInability to sort threads from newest to oldest. Judging by forum posts spanning many years, this is a long standing gripe among users. But I’ll trade it for spam recognition any day.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-04-22T04:20:14-07:00"},{"id":"7489790644","userName":"J.Fish9er","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29467578","version":"4.2124.0","score":2,"title":"It’s possible it could be worse I guess…","text":"This might be the worst app on my phone. \n\nNumber one, the search function is garbage. You can literally search the same term in the desktop version and in the app version and get utterly different results. My main result using the app search is literally nothing, even when I’m using sender email or contents of email. I guess it could be worse but if you are without desktop access and need to find an email older than this week or month, good luck. \n\nNumber two, there is no interoperability between iCal and outlook. If you’re using a secure email system and can’t link the account to your mail app, you have no way of using the calendar. So you end up having two calendars on one phone. I’m pretty sure not having to do this is one of the main benefits of a smart phone, but i guess Apple and Microsoft still hate each other more than they care about customer service, so you can’t get outlook events in your Apple calendar. Or vice versa. Has led to me missing several appointments as a result.\n\nFinally, for whatever reason printing and PDFing within this app is extremely clunky. You basically have to trick it into triggering apple’s native pdf creation in order to get it to work properly. I don’t know why it’s so difficult to just forward attachments or other documents but it’s not great. \n\nIt does the job so I’m not giving it 1 star, but the user experience vastly underwhelms.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-21T07:36:13-07:00"},{"id":"10563744227","userName":"Lossite","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27371684","version":"4.2343.0","score":5,"title":"Great email app for all my fellow road warriors","text":"I don’t review apps often, but since starting a new job that lets me use the native Outlook app to it’s full potential versus a different email client (BlackBerry Work), I’m blown away. \n\nThe real feature I want to highlight is the Cortana integration for audibly reading and actioning your mailbox.

I am not using Exchange, so my workaround was to add my iCloud account and then have it sync with my PC running iCloud for Windows. No joy. Syncing of \"all day\" events was random and arbitrary at best.\n\nNor does the app support syncing with the PC's Task list even if (I believe) the user is on Exchange. This is a major issue for me.\n\nFinally, the app does not play well with IMAP email accounts. First, it took a ton of time to set up the account because the \"automatic\" setup did not work. In the end I opted to set the account up manually, but it still took several tries. Once up and running, receiving emails seemed ok, but on average over 45 seconds would elapse before I heard the chime notifying me that my email had been successfully sent.

It's been 2 days and I haven't been able to see what emails I have received at all without checking on my computer, updating was a complete mistake, i will update the app again when a new update shows up, hopefully it will fix whatever went wrong and then, never update again, because like I said before, updates never fix or improve and app, they just ruin in\n0 STAR REVIEW","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-11-26T09:23:55-07:00"},{"id":"4273493219","userName":"LordCorwin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id901156140","version":"3.26.0","score":1,"title":"The calendar is basically useless","text":"I'm really disappointed with the quality of the calendar part of the app. I don't understand why the desktop software, office 365 desktop version, office 365 mobile version, and iOS app calendars are completely different from one another. The iOS version is completely useless as a business calendar because I can't even add group calendars from my organization. How stupid is that? I'm deleting the app because it serves no purpose. I can view my emails just aa easily in a mobile web browser, and the calendar at least works moderately better. However, the desktop office 365 version is by far the best of the 3 viewable on mobile because it actually contains all of the information and functionality that the desktop software has. It's incredibly frustrating that I have to go to this level of manipulation of the web server just to perform basic tasks. This is extremely easy to do in other email apps like GMail, and those don't require a license.

Using platform specific software has always been my mainstay. Try it and learn it. Whenever you learn something thoroughly, it enhances ones life.\n\nWhen introduced to Outlook on a Mac, it was great because I could adapt quickly. However, on my new job, I’m using windows platform and Outlook has been seamless. Having to adapt to a windows platform was hard. Outlook made it simpler. It took a little while, and I will not turn back. I learn something new daily.\n\nAs a graphic designer, viewing is important. I have found the layout of the calendar in my emails and the alert I receive meet all of my needs. It looks more than just an email software. It encompasses chats, meetings, calendars, emails, and so much more.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-28T05:53:49-07:00"},{"id":"5400612721","userName":"Marty89899","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1122022193","version":"4.19.0","score":2,"title":"Problems","text":"Search works poorly. Emails I know are there don’t show up. Recent and most annoying, if you are reading an email, switch to another app and come back the email you opened had closed and you’ve gone back to inbox’s newest email. If you had searched for the earlier email you have to start searching all over again. Ugh! And, finally, an incredibly annoying and problematic problem:  if I’m drafting an email and move to another screen or app and come back to edit or continue writing, and try to place the cursor where I want to write, the cursor jumps to the very bottom of the screen even if the email chain is 10 emails long. I can’t get the cursor back to where I need it. Sometimes if I close the email and reopen it, it may work but only sometimes. Unbelievably frustrating. I haven’t talked to our company IT team about it yet, but this is becoming very problematic. Must be fixed. All this on iOS 13.3","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-01-13T18:34:34-07:00"},{"id":"8208447164","userName":"kategonzo18","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id486118262","version":"4.2148.2","score":1,"title":"Would rate 0 stars if I could","text":"Im forced to use this email service for my university and almost every month without fail I get signed out of my account on the app. My university made us set up 2FA where it calls our phone to log back in and EVERY time the phone app signs me out, I’ll try to sign back in and answer the call and it will say my sign in verification was successfully completed but then it doesn’t log me back in and just tells me that there was an error and to “try again later”. I could wait for WEEKS and the error still wouldnt fix itself. Ive found that when this happens the only way to sign back in is to completely delete the app then redownload it. Sometimes even that doesn’t fix the issue until I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app 6 times within one day. Extremely unreliable and annoying. So glad I graduate in four months so that I hopefully never have to use this crappy excuse for an email service ever again","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-05T14:27:07-07:00"},{"id":"9824324249","userName":"Chelle B519","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id772357275","version":"4.2313.0","score":2,"title":"Needs to catch up with native iPhone apps","text":"We were required to move to the Outlook app over the native mail app on our company devices. It took four days to get (almost) everything back. The calendar is definitely a downgrade from the native calendar. Contacts have to be re-imported and even if you have photos attached in Outlook on your PC, they don’t carry over. If you try to add a photo to the contact on your phone you find out that “photos are not supported”.  Really?  That should be an easy fix. And you can’t edit your contact from the contact list. The fix?  You have to create a second contact on your phone, add a photo and then link the two together. What a pain!  And don’t count on your notes from Outlook coming over. Nooooo, you have to download OneNote and connect to that so you can view them in the Sticky Notes. Come on Microsoft. This is why Apple continues to dominate the market.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-15T05:19:00-07:00"}]
