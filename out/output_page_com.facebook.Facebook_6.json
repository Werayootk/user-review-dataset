Congress doesn’t care because the owners of Meta are lining the pockets of Congress and sharing your data.\nFacebook is full of people who use the app to whine about their perceived hardships in life like it’s their personal daily journal entry. \nIf you’d like some medical advise from someone who doesn’t have a medical degree and barely passed high school biology class Facebook has you covered with loads of medical misinformation. \nSimilarly if you’d like to learn inaccurate information on how the government works from boomers who never even had a single civics class let alone watched a single episode of School House rock then check out Facebook. Here you can enjoy being called “libtard” and “woke” by your fellow small town Christian if you dare to share correct info on how the government works or express love for everyone. I mean…. Jesus said to hate people, call them names and pass laws that discriminate against them after all… am I right ?

However if that’s the case Facebook should really be more 16+ or 18+. You can’t even say “white” or “black” without it being considered a “hate speech” and “racism” and that’s just the tiniest of it, also my account is getting flagged for posts I shared back in 2015?! That’s just beyond ridiculous. You get 1-2 account warnings and then restricted for about a month? Absurd. Not only that, your account warnings don’t ever fall off or go away, they are there forever. So at some point your going to end up loosing your whole profile. I don’t know who bought Facebook but you did a terrible job at “community standards” Facebook was originally known for sharing funny memes, even if they are a little offensive. That’s the joke of it. If someone doesn’t like it they can simply block you. It’s boring at this point. Also move the profile picture back to the center, it’s looks stupid on the side. Plus I’ve spent years trying to find photos I can use as a cover photo that I can have both my children’s face in, now it covers one of their entire faces.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-14T04:59:38-07:00"},{"id":"8040888118","userName":"bearbear1717","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id322752249","version":"343.1","score":1,"title":"Horrible horrible customer service amongst other things","text":"I’ve never left a negative review before, but Facebook has certainly warranted my first one. I could go on rants about how they dictate political views, oppress freedom of speech and so forth, but that’s surprisingly not why I’m writing this. This company truly has the worst customer support I’ve ever encountered. Not only is personal information not secure, so much so that my account has been hacked numerous times, regardless how many of their “security steps” I go through or how complicated I make my new passwords. Recently, my account was hacked and the hacker got me banned from marketplace. I followed the steps to have the FB team review my account, which they deemed me to not be at fault for. They said it was all good and I should have access again. It’s been two weeks now of me reporting issues regularly and trying to contact any support. No dice. There’s literally no way to actually get help. They’ve done a great job and punishing me for their own lack of security. My overall experience with Facebook is negative 5 stars. I can’t think of a company I would like to give a worse review of.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-11-19T08:40:40-07:00"},{"id":"7376868595","userName":"rauespi","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id204492335","version":"319.0","score":1,"title":"Notifications ang tagged error","text":"I don't receive notifications when someone replies to my comment and tag me\nWhen I leave a comment to a page I liked or a group that I am a part of, I dont'e get notified when someones replies to my comment or the thread of comments I have replied to.

I would like to get notifications when somebody replies specifically to my comments or my replies under a post. The only notification I get, is when someone likes my comment. The only way to see if someone replied to my comment is to find the post, then search for my comment and then see if someone replied. In some posts that hundrends of people are replying, this is extremely difficult. You might also get a replay and never see it because it happened a day or two after you left the comment.

The thing I like best about FB, is that you can see what family and friends are up to, check in with group pages you belong to, read articles people post, and laugh at funny memes. Different people post different things, so some friends may get political, some do not. You will see sides of people you know that have extreme positions on topics you would never have guessed. But you can keep scrolling, take a break from what they post, or defriend them. Some people are bent out of shape for getting blocked for posting fake news, but FB stepped up to letting people know when something was fake, rather than perpetuating things that aren’t true.  \n\nFacebook is still a good app for what I always have used it for, staying in touch with family and friends.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-16T10:10:31-07:00"},{"id":"6001431676","userName":"Staciafriction","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id155046818","version":"271.0","score":4,"title":"Latest update hurts my heart","text":"In the latest update, the app no longer has the “share” button when you try to share a post to a group. You must individually look up and share each group, which is cumbersome and takes far more steps/time. My child is a brand Rep, and it used to be so convenient to make our promotion post and share in 5-10 groups with a few quick taps. Now, I have to individually share the post to each individual group. I understand it is probably some kind of safety feature to prevent hackers and bots and bugs, but it has really made it more difficult for us. \n\nAlso, the new layout on the computer (not the app, but the physical website) has me all sorts of lost and confused. I’m a pretty tech-y person, but when you move everything from its relative location, it makes it much more difficult of an interface to use. \n\nLove the new avatars though!!! They are super fun and cute!!!

Posting can be frustrating as it’s not altogether user friendly. It is fun though and my friends and family have often enjoyed my posts. One very good thing about FB for me has been rekindling old friendships and mostly staying in touch with family I might never have seen or spoken to again. A VERY good thing. Another good thing has been making new friends on vacation, work, or whatever, becoming FB friends, and just occasionally staying in touch to see how things are going or even plan a trip together (we’ve done it many times). The thing I use FB for the most now is Communications. I get involved with several different groups. A group of people can create a “Group Page” exclusively only to people allowed by the Group Creator (“Admin”). This group can then freely post meeting notices updates on group events, WHATEVER. It’s all private to that group. I’ve done this MANY times. It’s very helpful.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-19T10:52:41-07:00"},{"id":"10253068427","userName":"keepemcomming","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42758264","version":"427.1","score":5,"title":"Can Anyone Find True Love on Facebook?","text":"This place is way better than Disneyland.

The scammers here are extremely professional and courteous, kind, and loving. They work very hard to create an illusion of happiness.

First and most important is that whatever they use to monitor the posts we make on here is a total failure. People are put in FB jail because they don’t care if it’s the spell correct that is at fault for the wrong words that get replaced with something FB dreams wrong or unflavored. FB is too judgmental and won’t listen to us as to posting freedom. We think your guidelines are too strict and unyielding and uninterested in hearing our explanations. We are human and make mistakes, not an AI .while FB let’s posts go I corrected that get reported for intense language, vulgar and vile pictures and stories. Animal abuse is rampant on here, sexual posts, scammers are ignored daily. Bugs in the system all the time, nothing gets fixed or corrected for far too long. This is why so many of my friends on FB have either left and not returned and people are just fed up with the many flaws.
