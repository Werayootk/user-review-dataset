9353048963,scammed by scammin supply,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1276393553,22.44.0,1,Bad Service,I bought one item from here. I wouldn‚Äôt have cause they charge an outrageous amount of fees but the seller didn‚Äôt budge and choose this route. I tried selling one pair on here and was instantly blocked for not having 20 pictures of the shoes but the shoes I purchased didn‚Äôt have so many pictures. After reading the other reviews on here I decided to delete the app and stick to OfferUp EBay and Grailed.

Regardless of picture and description accuracy. When you send in more pictures of the item they claim it‚Äôs edited (when it‚Äôs not) They completely ignore all the good reviews you already have. No point in selling on here, only buying apparently so you can get free stuff.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=632064380&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-21T08:10:53-07:00

So I made a Profil again.
Uploaded my items on my profile (leggings, jeans, sneaker ) and the next Morning I woke up to my profile being deleted for guide line violations for selling my items???? It makes no sense. I'm using my own photos and not some
Internet Pictures from someone else. There's no option to put dispute to fix the issue. 
Then I tried to make a new profile because I couldn't log into my old one anymore obviously and it got deleted before I even got the chance to start selling my stuff.
