The app asks for most recent company & initially, I typed in the business i worked for, but a list of 7 of the same business & logo with slight variations to the name popped up. I then typed in the management company & found it easily & selected it. Now realizing that was a mistake, the changes are irreversible. 

Firstly, in setting up the profile, it asks for most recent position, but not if that position is current. Now, after the profile is set up, it’s set to where I currently work for… which not only isn’t the the right business, but also is not current. Yes, you can add additional information to complete the start/end dates, but you cannot change the name of the business.

I got this app, because I’ve heard great things about it from many people, but now am hesitant to use it from fear of unintentionally displaying false information to prospective employers… not a good way to start a new job.

11013083594,Trebills,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id181901908,9.1.356,1,Honestly just a joke,"This sums it up, “ Finally. After a solid year of being unemployed, not for want of trying, I have secured a job. And a good one at that. A big thank you to a particular member of my personal network, you know who you are and I couldn't have done it without you.
With that said, I have something else to say.
I learned a valuable lesson during this experience. And that is only my real-life connections matter. Networking the corporate way, the Linkedin way, is as thin and as artificial as plastic. This website combines the two worst aspects of modern life, vapid corporate culture and the mind-poison of social media. And what it purported to provide in turn, it doesn't. At least not in my experience and in the words of others online who report the exact same things.
There was the promise of employment opportunities, but even on this platform users acknowledge hiring is sparse at best. Valuable personal networks were another prospect, but being real or yourself is strongly advised against, instead they insist you wear a bland, white-washed mask and follow a generic, unoffensive script, just like everyone else. They insisted you need it to get ahead in your career, but that also doesn't seem to be reality, just a reflection of the vain hope that engagement on this site makes you a 'thought leader', an
'influencer' or a similar drivel-spewer and that, somehow, this will translate into promotions and success.
This site only exists to sell false hope and resume services.
So, I have decided to delete my Linkedin account. I wish I could say it was a tough decision I deliberated hours and hours on, but that would be a lie. By the time any of you read this, it'll be gone. And good riddance.
Since you denizens of this site seem to rather like quotes, here's one from the great Billy Joel:
""And it seems such a waste of time. If that's what it's all about. Mama, if that's movin' up, then I'm... movin' out.""
You can keep your wasteland of ghost jobs, brain-dead 'leadership' quotes, advertisements masquerading as posts, and people who apparently live in the office insisting you should never take vacations, sick days, or weekends, I'm out!”",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-05T19:03:56-07:00
