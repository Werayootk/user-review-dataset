11064204303,MaggieAlwaysLovesDami,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id305731226,9.1.358,3,Some amazing things happening here (minus the cost),"Interesting app for professionals promoting themselves, networking, and learning about passionate, lucrative topics. 

Thought the subscription fee was $40/year..actually it’s like $40/month. 

I love that it can help you make a mark in your industry of choice, link up with professionals all over the world at events to make impact in your local community, and even help people transition and meet their goals; however, I do not want to continue spending $40/month at this time for the premium edition. I believe the premium edition is more useful for someone actively seeking new employment opportunities for themselves or their staff, but at this time, I don’t see how it benefits me, yet (for premium access).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T22:56:14-07:00
