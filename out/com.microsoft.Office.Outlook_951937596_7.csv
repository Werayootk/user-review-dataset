When it comes to reading and composing emails, it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do. But a few (what some would see as minor) things are incredibly annoying. Why in the world can‚Äôt I customize my font when composing emails? This seems like an easy feature to provide. Why is it 2024 and we can‚Äôt get our email signatures to look the way we want them to look? And don‚Äôt get me started with trying to include images in them. Again, a few steps short of perfect.
