First off, the time and service signal are no longer displayed in landscape mode when directions are going. I travel full time and like to see what my cell service is in certain areas for work purposes. Now I can’t do that without stopping, exiting the app, and looking at my service bars. Really annoying. 

Secondly, when directions are going it no longer tells your total miles left to the destination, only the total time. That’s not always as helpful, especially if you hit traffic. Being able to see both time and distance left to destination is essential. 

Lastly, I have had way too many times where I choose an alternate route (not the fastest), but midway through the route it switches back to the “fastest” route, taking me through areas I wanted to avoid. It’s incredibly frustrating. 

To sum it up, the app would be better if it showed the time and service bars while routing, showed time AND distance to the destination, and did not change the route to the fastest route after deliberately choosing a specific route (suggesting another route is fine, but default to no when doing so).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-21T15:19:13-07:00

I’ve happily used google maps basically ever since I owned my first phone. Yes, I have tried every other GPS app and I still prefer google maps. I love the timeline and the location sharing features (although I preferred them spatially where they were before they moved them). 

Now to the issue... I noticed a few days ago that my phone’s battery was consistently draining way faster than usual, and upon taking a look at the battery usage breakdown, I found that for the past few weeks google maps has been using a lot more battery than usual in what is started as “background use”. I ran some tests and realized that if I didn’t open the app in the entire day and didn’t have it open in the background, it would consume 2-3% of my phone’s battery a day. But if I so much as opened it and didn’t terminate the background process, it would consume anywhere from 25-32% of my battery just by having opened it and not using the navigation feature. 

I figured it would be fixed with a future update but it hasn’t. 

Today, for the first time in 15+ years I considered looking for another alternative. Please fix this issue. I love this app! Keep up the hard work, google, well done!

 Another complaint is that Google Maps is, most of the time, confused about which direction you are heading when it first starts a route.

Google maps has priorities that will waste a lot of people’s time. It decides to load information about the road first, rather than loading information of the road itself. i.e. traffic instead of the actual route. because of this, it takes quite a while to load routes and reroutes, and by the time one is found, you’ve missed a turn and the process starts again. it basically forces you to stop and find one ahead of time. 
Another problem is the fact that it doesn’t tell you the speed limit of the road that you are currently on.

BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM! a problem so big it basically renders googles map USELESS!!
Is that it calculates your routes based on distance, and not the speed of the roads. example: there are two routes you can take to your destination; a beltway and a b-line road straight to it. the beltway route is about 5 miles, but is posted at 70 mph and will take you no more than 7 minutes to get there. The b-line road however, is only 2 miles, but posted as 10 mph. guess which one it will choose?
This is pretty much exactly what happened to me. Google maps turned, what could’ve have been a 10 minutes trip, to a full 40 minute one. This is just unacceptable.
