11000799738,Mercc300,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1381791324,6.104.2,5,DoorDasher app uses google maps in app.,"The last two weeks I end up almost crying and I. A panic every EVERY order I pick up and deliver. Why? As a door dasher I pay my mortgage and my food with my JOB delivering food. We can GET FIRED AUTOMATICALLY if we are late or do UNNECESSARY MILES during a dash because I get paid hourly because I choose to work 55 hours a week. So. Google maps will give me directions to my customers house but take me into neighborhoods and literally drive around a couple of blocks to then exit the neighborhood and drive a few miles to my actual customers home!!!!! What is happening!!!!!!
Another one is it takes me in the opposite direction down the highway for five minutes THEN SAYS MAKE A U TURN! I then just wasted a huge amount of time going in opposite directions! Since dasher app used google maps in app I am so busy I just follow the step by step procedures outlined by the dasher app when delivering for a customer so for example we do not get entire info at once. We get the step one direction to restaurant. Once there we press arrived we can see what is ordered. Once the order is handed to us we press confirm and we THEN get the customers address directions etc. so it‚Äôs not like we can plan ahead without opening Apple Maps or Waze and taking the TIME to copy the address into these other map apps and double checking which app is correct. ALSO IT WILL TAKE ME TO THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE 5 times out of 10. 
Also in a big apartment complex it will always take me TO THE FRONT OFFICE AND NOT THE AREA OF THE BUILDING (god google even a ballpark area of the apartment building address would save me looking CRAZY AS A 46 year old women RUNNING FULL BLAST WITH A DOOR DASH BAG AROUND EVERY BUILDING IN A COMPLEX ZIG ZAGGING TRYING TO FIND BUILDING Y AND IM AT BUILDING M!!!!!! 
now. We have the option to select Apple Maps and Waze as our maps in the dasher app BUT if we do DoorDash warns us NOT TO AND now it will put our door dasher app in the background and have to open up our maps out of app in a whole new window. :-(. 
So. Google. My kids and my cats will starve if I get fired. Please fix this. I JUST WANT TO DELIVER CUSTOMERS FOOD EARLY OR ON TIME AND DO A GOOD JOB AT MY WORK.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-02T10:22:41-07:00

Where‚Äôs the filter for highly rated locations, filter for price point, or even a filter for black owned business. a filter for how long the business has been on google. I would expect there to be more than a distance and relevance filter at this point.

Also, wouldnt it be cool to be able to see how far a location is from you while you are already in route to another one. Having to exit active nativigation in order to search a different location is a waste of time. Especially when I conclude the first location I was en route to is better. I know you can search along route but it‚Äôs as a stop add on, I‚Äôm mean a separate navigation/search just to weight options. See reviews, phones numbers etc. just as you would on a web browser. That would be awesome/

An lastly that navigation arrow is bothersome. I go the direction it says after giving it a moment to calibrate and it tells me I‚Äôm going the wrong way lol so annoying.

Same thing with font. How do I zoom in to read names but not have the font stay the same size? -- I hate the advertising all over my map. I don't shop at the Wade-in-McHina store, nor do I eat at McIcky's so I have no need to know where they are. I spent (wasted?) time awhile ago trying to eliminate useless categories without success but would love to see that change. 

I kinda feel sorry for people who do stupid things when using Google *Maps* ‚Ä¶ or do I? Here‚Äôs how to help protect yourself from time wasting mistakes (like e.g. driving into an apartment complex while trying to go to a restaurant) and help yourself long term. Get your route and stop there. No directions, at least no audio. Now you'll talk yourself through the route to your destination. If you're uncertain about cardinal directions use left, right, u-turn, etc. I often use both. Narrate the route to yourself *out loud* ‚Äª:  
‚ùù*Pull out on 38th St, turn right (south) Get in the left lane when it's convenient *Drive 7 blocks(1mi) to Navajo Ave, turn left (east) Continue east for 2 miles past the edge of town, past Foxvale. The compost pickup is on your right (south) *If you get to 2 schools you've gone too far.‚ùû  
Don't panic if you make a mistake- just pull over and reorient yourself. You won't have that awful voice nor do your passengers *and* you‚Äôll gain map knowledge rather than barely functional route knowledge so you‚Äôll actually know where you are. Putting yourself in the middle of the map won‚Äôt help you understand what direction you‚Äôre facing. 

Some of the ""I hate what happened with the update"" complaints aren't hard to prevent: turn off automatic updates. (Reset it in Settings.) I don't bother with updates for watch, for example, because I don't have one and it may have introduced a bug. New versions of iOS have to prove themselves after I was burned awhile back.

‚Äª Speaking the directions engages motor and audio processing so it should help with your understanding and recall.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-29T16:18:38-07:00

It serves no purpose, and it adds to the distraction. Also lately it shows out of the blue different itineraries . I was driving on interstate 85 from NC to GA . I was driving at night and there was no traffic . Google maps was giving me options to leave the interstate and go on a freakin triangle for absolutely no reason . I understand if it was traffic or road construction .

Update :02/29/2024 I went from 5 stars to 3 to 1. Google is getting dumber by the day . 
Another annoying thing is it sends me notifications to rate this restaurant that I already rated 2 years ago . I rated it 5 stars and I even posted pictures . I moved to Colorado since then. Two years later for some weird reason keeps popping on my screen to rate it AGAIN . Here in Colorado when I choose directions to go to the airport and I avoid tolls , it changes automatically without even letting you know and sends you to the toll route . It‚Äôs almost seems like Google is getting paid by the toll authority to do that . 
Thank God for Apple Maps that are way better nowadays . I started using Google maps less and less . The only thing I hate about Apple Maps is they incorporated Yelp for reviews ‚Ä¶and Yelp is the worst app ever!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-29T13:49:51-07:00

I had to delete the google maps app to even be able to pull up the website version and then I was able to get the rough estimate on the miles I‚Äôd be walking. For an app that supports walking directions it was incredibly stupid not to have that as a feature. The Google maps app will not be downloaded again. Consider this a breakup google. üíî",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-29T09:57:43-07:00
