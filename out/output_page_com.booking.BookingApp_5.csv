Great that many hotels have last minute free cancellation options, which is soooo great for my spontaneity!  No hidden charges.  East app to access.  Only one thing that I would suggest.  Sometimes when it says “no credit card needed” I learn when I get to the hotel that the hotel doesn’t actually take credit cards.  It should say on the page directly so we know beforehand.  I don’t travel with much cash so this situation has been an issue several times so far.

We reserved our room on line. Our reservation was found quickly in the system I was asked for ID and the cared used and we were given our rooms quickly.

We had an issue with a clogged toilet and the poor gentleman was the only person aside from housekeeping and he was doing it all and well, might I add.

He said it would be handled quickly and minutes after I returned to my room a small crew of gentlemen arrived and we had no more issues after.

Everything was clean and neat. If you don’t have toiletries (we had our own, so we left theirs for you. Lol) they had plenty as a courtesy in the restroom. Minimal, but beautiful asthetic. We saw a couple enjoying the hot tub during the unseasonably cold weather, and I did see the nice gym on the first floor. We were only there one night so we did not have the opportunity to utilize them. 

Seems like a really nice and modern establishment.

We were treated well.

Booking has this tendency where you would open up the flights tab and for some odd reason it starts the calendar on the month in advance. (Ex. Its the month of February and it pulls the calendar for March). Normally I catch this and stop myself from going through the actual booking. My friend is not well and I was only able to work my job’s schedule around to see him. I rushed quickly to find a flight for him. I booked my flight with intentions of leaving the next morning. I get to the airport running back and forth from the ticket booth to the check in just to get told that I booked for the month in advance. Typically I would look away from this thing. but now just to cancel or even get a refund Im getting taxed.

However, service is not.
Room windows do not open, which while grudgingly tolerable at a Holliday Inn, is a huge negative at a premium, boutique hotel - at a super premium price point they maintain.
Upon arrival, we found no hangers in the closet, and a locked safe that could not be used. It took a call to fix both issues.
On the first day of our stay, the room was serviced/cleaned only in the late evening, and then only when we complained at the front desk after returning around 6 pm to a messy room, as we left it in the morning.
Furthermore, we realized only on the third and the last night, that there is a rather pleasant room turndown protocol, that involves soothing ambient music and an aromatherapy lava lamp - shame that nobody bothered to do this the first two nights.
Finally, experience with the valet parking (expensive, outsourced, and only form of parking available through the hotel) is mixed at best. There’s one attendant available at a time, so if there’s more than one or two guests waiting for their cars, there can be a 15-20 min wait. On several occasions, there was a clear lack of communication between the hotel staff and the valet parking staff, resulting in confusion, and further delays.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2018-04-30T04:29:12-07:00

This is my fourth and last visit to this hotel. Each visit has gotten worse. The lobby staff are all unkempt and all look like they just rolled out of bed. The ice machines don’t work.  The entire exterior of the property looks like it never receives any maintenance.

This hotel looks like a property that is on its way out but the management is trying to get a few bucks more out of it before shutting it down.

This last visit has been by far the worst hotel stay of my life. The bedsheets were all wrinkled. Every single one of them. The one on the bed, the cover sheet, the comforter, pillow cases,. They all look like they came from another room where they were tossed in a corner overnight then placed on my bed.  To make matters worse, the bed was lopsided to the right.

The toilet bowl was thoroughly stained with “S” marks. The door to the room would not close thoroughly and less you leaned and pushed on it. The colors on the TV were horrific. It appears that there’s no quality control at this property whatsoever.

I was almost tempted to go sleep in my car.

To the property owners: Realize when enough is enough. It is time for you to either shut this hotel down or completely revamp it.

The time has come. 

This hotel is perfectly located but it appears that the owners are unaware of this jewel that they have.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-14T15:13:56-07:00

This weekend I book a trip to Vegas and the hotel was horrible , room dirty , noise like you can’t imagine all night . For the first time I ask a refund to booking since it was anything like it should have be . It’s been 4 days that they put me on hold for hours . No manager call me back . Nothing has been done yet . I understand from if it was someone who always call to ask refund but it’s not the case it’s the first time on my side on more than 10 trip . Anyway I will never book with them again , I was thinking reserving with a third part will assure you to don’t deal with all this crap , I was wrong . Booking act like a scammer.

So it was no problem adding the extra person but then they charged me double the amount from the original price I booked for. I took a screen shot of it and submitted it for proof and they are lying to my face saying they don’t see that price ever being offered. So how the h*ll do I have a screen shot then.

I tried canceling at the Hilton hotel at Munich Airport when British Air canceled my flight and rescheduled me on an earlier flight. Hilton said I had to cancel through Booking where I made the reservation. Then Booking said I had to contact Hilton to get it canceled. Everyone points their finger to everyone else and not trying to help their customer. I will not use a 3rd party travel company because of lack of service and Booking is an example of a company not standing behind their customer.
