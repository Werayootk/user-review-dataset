Capcut has definitely improved a lot sense it was released and I have never stopped editing on it sense. The new transitions are awesome! Capcut allows me to save a lot of time because of the new updates. Seeing the edits that other people make on capcut that don‚Äôt even look like it was made on capcut makes me have much higher hopes about this app! The only downside I have of this app is that capcut doesn‚Äôt seem to get back to me with my template. The first time I decided to apply for capcut creator they rejected me and they got back to me in 3 days. However, the second time I applied for capcut creator they NEVER got back to me and I‚Äôm a little confused about that. It has been almost 2 months sense the second time I applied to be a template creator and capcut specifically specifies that in 15 working days they will get back to you. Sadly yet, no response. Maybe it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt updated my capcut yet or it‚Äôs just because they haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but who knows. Capcut, if you could get back to me on what is going on with this template creator thing it would be a blessing.

  This app infuriates me. You can get banned for touching on serious issues that need to be heard but they let others comment badly about others and more. I reported a video making fun of a disabled girl and you know what tiktok said? No violation. So what, do you guys support ableism? Another thing, ive seen people get banned just because someone spam reported them. I mean yes sometimes people do bad things but not show it on tiktok but cmon! There are innocent people who do nothing wrong, like take therians. I‚Äôve seen so many get mass reported so that they get banned. This just makes me so angry. Tiktok needs to get thier report system controlled and looked at! We shouldn‚Äôt have to go great lengths to get our accounts back because tiktok couldn‚Äôt use thier brains!! Even more, thier is a girl (not saying who just because i don‚Äôt want her getting even more popular) who has an ed. She won‚Äôt let others help and she literally looks like she‚Äôs on the brink of d3ath and tiktok just promotes her! She need to be banned so she‚Äôs off tiktok, doesn‚Äôt see anything harmful, and in hopes it will be a wake up call to her. Tiktok has ruined many lives, so does other apps. But if you want to have a successful platform do your job, listen to your audience, and help those in need.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-24T15:50:55-07:00

The user-designed engagement is beneficial for those who seek positive influences to learn and expand their understanding of different cultures as well as personal growth. Their immediate response to requests for assistance is unprecedented compared to alternative social media platforms. While I am technologically challenged due to cognitive disabilities, I find this to be the best platform for ease of use and access and global reach. Kudos to TikTok for developing a means to increase global awareness and relationships among so many cultural dimensions. My only concern is privacy and lack of transparency in the government‚Äôs involvement in this platform. The manner in which user information is being collected raises privacy concerns. Additionally intellectual property rights/protection and plagiarism is not addressed anywhere.

Currently there is an account on their platform that is putting George Floyd's face on life sized dolls and doing a number of disturbing things with the dolls. From running the dolls over with a steam roller to having the doll thrust when audio is played that says his murderer's name. This account has been reported probably hundreds of times by various other accounts (mine included) and yet the result is that Tik Tok every single time so far has determined that that type of content ""doesn't violate community guidelines.""

In addition to this many creators and users of the app (myself included) have noticed that white creators are routinely allowed to use the n word (content doesn't get removed when reported) while Black creators have their content removed and even their accounts suspended when they stitch this content in attempt to raise awareness and ask the white creators to stop using harmful language. BIPOC creators also get their content removed and their accounts suspended for simply talking about the discrimination they face in their every day lives.

Heres some things you should know before saying yes!
tiktok allows you to have a private or public account, public is when anybody on the app can see your videos, private is were everyone has to request to see the account or videos, if a child under the age of 13 asked to get the app, definitely make sure they make their acc private! How to do that is you go to your profile, press the three dots in the right corner of the screen, press privacy and tap the little switch next to the words‚Äùprivate acc‚Äù and there you go! I definitely recommend to make your child's account private, there are many adults on the app that may be a little to creepy. but over all the app is amazing for you child to learn new things and have a fun time! If you are thinking about getting the app yourself Over the age of 15 I definitely recommend it! Its a-lot of fun and you get to show your creativity by roleplays,coloring videos, edits, and really anything!!!! But tiktok is not the best place to share private information to random strangers on the app,So please stay safe while using the app!! but like i said its a great and fun app! I love it myself!

We all save videos to our favorites for different reasons so it would be really nice to have them all separated into folders we could customize the names of. EX: if I want to save a recipe for later but I also want to save a video of someone dancing, I could have to seperate folders for recipes, and people dancing. Obviously we could just save the videos to our camera rolls but 1. The creator sometimes doesn‚Äôt allow you to save the video 2. It takes up LOTS of storage. Ive talked about this idea with all my friends and they all agree it would be such a nice update. I have had a feeling this is probably already coming in the future or has atleast been considered but I just wanted to give some feedback from someone who really enjoys the app!

One of my problems is that why are we only able to go live if we have 1000 or more fans. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense because if you have a small tiktok page then maybe if you go live you can get more fans.  People With 1000 fans or more are not small tiktok pages.  I only have about 90 followers so if I go live I could possibly get more fans. But since you can‚Äôt go live unless you have 1000 fans or more I can‚Äôt get more fans from live.  I also have another problem, it‚Äôs also about live.  So I was watching a tiktoker on live and I left for about 10 minutes and when I got back on the live ended.  So I just so happen to see a video of her saying ‚Äú I‚Äôm so sick and tired of people reporting me for being under age when I‚Äôm literally 19 years old‚Äù That mad me and her both upset.

Many people post videos of them drinking and will mention in the caption that they are of legal drinking age and that they do not recommend underage drinking, yet will be penalized for it (when many other videos are not). I once posted a video that was inspired by several other videos on the app, which contained short clips of each friend of mine drinking, and then passing the drink to the next person. My video was taken down due to a violation of community guidelines, so I submit an appeal mentioning how everyone in the video was 21. It got put back up but got barely any views, so I reposted it. It got taken down immediately and they did not accept my second appeal? It does not make sense and was not fair considering they accepted my first appeal.

     First off, the lives. Only people over 1000 followers get to go live, which I think is ridiculous. Maybe you should give new users around 25-50 followers when they first start so at least they have something.  Secondly,  you need to fix your issue where people randomly get suspended by their lives for getting reported. When someone is reporting you should make it a REQUIREMENT to have evidence and if they don‚Äôt have any, their complaint is invalid.  Thirdly, the age limit. It needs to be where people only up to 20-25 should be able to sign up, minus ‚Äúthebentist‚Äù and the other cool, family friendly tik-tokers that everyone loves.  I think this because girls and boys are constantly getting verbally harassed by older people on tiktok, such as the Budday.  They are being forced to do things they don‚Äôt want to or see graphic things. Or are tricked to give personal info such as their number, email, etc. These are just a few of my complaints. Please work on these because these are universal problems on TikTok.

I will select an audio, put it over the video I want to upload because it has the same sound, and then I proceed to lower the volume of the audio I selected to zero as the video im uploading already has the sound and matches up better. When I do this however, going to upload my video it just removes the audio and makes one uploaded under my account which isn‚Äôt what I wanted to do.

I am almost an all American Women üòú. I am White racially and Mexican ethnically‚Ä¶in 2018 I became a wife I married into an Indian family Punjabi Indian family to be exact. I become a preschool teacher assistant and obtained my yoga certification to instruct. I feel I have alot to share on this app I‚Äôm my own way. So that‚Äôs cool and I‚Äôm working gaining the knowledge of how to shoot edgy and clean videos. But the best thing I gained from this app was meeting women with a common background like mine and marrying into an Indian family as well‚Ä¶we had something in common in many ways and are being introduced to our spouses culture all together. A sisterhood has been built. But after a while I sort of took a break from Tiktok. I‚Äôm not back at sharing on tiktok my user name is aboutmekelsie and I tend to stick more to that.

3578673567,wicky.wick.wack,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id875081289,9.6.2,2,Caption,"I would like the caption on Tik Tok‚Äôs to not have no character limit and not just ‚ÄúTitle can‚Äôt exceed 100 characters‚Äù this really bothers me when I‚Äôm trying to explain something, but then having to take it to the comments while it can get lost in the comments and no one knowing the purpose. I would also like to not have a limit because maybe you are trying to explain something to your fans, but not having enough in the caption and also having to take it to the comments. I really think Tik Tok can improve on the caption even though it‚Äôs only used to write something very brief, I personally think it can be turned into something where you can write a whole paragraph and not having to take it anywhere else. For example you want to explain why you have been gone for awhile on Tik Tok so you write a whole paragraph and when you post it, it shows a little part of the paragraph to make it look like a caption, and says ‚Äúread more‚Äù in a bold font or is highlighted. But overall I really think Tik Tok is a great place to share your inspiration but just not enough in the caption because some others would like to read or hear your creativity and would like to read a whole paragraph about it (in my opinion).

I have to admit, musically is wayyyyy better than tik tok. The things that I like about the update are the different effects and filters. The things I don‚Äôt like at all are the glitchy-ness when I‚Äôm recording, the fact that I have to either save something as a draft or a private which really got confusing to me once the update launched, and also the fact that when I got the update, all of my previous private videos from musically got deleted from my account which I was very upset about! And please please please do something about all of those little kids reporting literally anything that they find ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù. Like seriously, it‚Äôs honestly gotten out of hand. I am a cosplayer and I have posted many of my videos on my account and it‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm known for but even though this has only happened a few times, people have reported some of my videos because they were apparently ‚Äúagainst community guidelines‚Äù like seriously what the heck?! There was absolutely nothing and I mean NOTHING wrong with the videos!

I have loss access to my account,videos and funds Accumulated while using live & in app purchases . I enjoy this platform but I have begun looking elsewhere as I am extremely dissatisfied with the treatment I have received while using this app. Most of the bans I have received were racially motivated in nature saying that my dancing was too sexual or being on a pole fully clothed was sexual yet people of other races are still allowed access while doing The exact same And sometimes worse! I need to get in contact with a supervisor or the apps creator regarding this Ill treatment! I have spent money and time using this platform and am EXTREMELY disappointed at this outcome.

So I exit out the app all the way then I come back and it will do the same thing but my draft will be there.

I tried it file a complaint but the app lagged when I had sent the report, so I don‚Äôt know if u got it. To sum it all up, TikTok deleted one year(maybe more) worth of drafts that I really loved. It started to rest on its own and delete my account. Then when I exit out of the app completely it will still do the same but I will or will not have my draft and the changes that I made to my TikTok will be gone so I will have to redo them.

I have seen every trend, every audio, every personalities rise and fall and then some. I went from daily and constant use, to having restrain myself to 10 videos at a time as to not lose myself in the app. But then they started editing the algorithm, catering to your interests and likes. This causes you to be completely consumed. It gives children, teenagers, and young adults a platform like never before, finding fame almost instantaneously if you understand how the app works and youre willing to sell your soul. My problem is not with how the app functions; it does its job perfectly. No, my problem is with the creators themselves. This is a Chinese app, there is an entire side of the app we cannot see we are not allowed to see and it begs the question what is on it? Thats also not my problem. Tiktok has demonstrated multiple times that it silences certain creators, and it is constant. Black people have been silenced. In light of recent events and the importance of awareness of the BLACK LIVES MATTER movement in the U.S. and now internationally, TikTok has deleted the hashtag #blacklivesmatter and related tags in an attempt to what I can assume is silence black voices and supporters. It is tiresome and disappointing and the app along with every police department in the U.S. deserves to burn.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-03T19:23:02-07:00
