At the moment I have counted the app crashing 8 times within the hour. I am on all of the latest app version and iOS. Another issue I have. You used to be able to go into an artist album and look at the songs and preview play them, now you can’t, this is extremely annoying when I’m trying to preview songs to add to my playlists. It was fine before but they are always changing it. Another issue I have are ads. There used to be 2-3 ads about every 30 minutes with the occasional “watch the video to get 30 minutes ad free” ad. Now, ads every 2-3 songs and when the watch video ad comes up, I still end up watching two more ads after the “so called” only video. The list goes on and on with things. This app was much better months ago but it is getting very out of hand. Looks like I’m switching to Apple Music I guess.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-18T22:55:05-07:00

I now must go to App Library. Creating more steps and confusion, due to the library shuffling unless pinned. Even if you have playlist pinned it is not found on the top of the home page anymore. I would love to revert this last update. Less convenient than more. PLEASE FIX/ REVERT. I will still give it a 5 star due to the app having many features other apps may not such as playback settings, perfect for using on different devices.

I use it every day and it does its job okay. My problem with this app is its ads. Yes, I know that you can get rid of ads by purchasing premium, but for those who don’t want premium their ad experience should be improved. I’ve been listening to the same ads on repeat for weeks. It gets tedious when I have the same nonsense spouted at me for hours worth of time. Another issue I have is the dislike ad feature. When you dislike an ad you shouldn’t hear it as often as you would normally right? But it seems as if this app hates me because when I dislike an ad it just plays it MORE often. Another issue, suggested songs. Suggested songs is a great feature, however, I’ve been having issues with it. I would be listening to a 3 hour long playlist, and only after hearing 9-10 songs off that playlist it would start suggesting songs. Songs should only be suggested after almost every song has played? So why am I hearing songs that I don’t want to listen too?

Generally these changes are a substantial UI improvement and navigating between various views is far more intuitive now that the notion of a my library home page, with all relevant shortcuts to artists, podcasts,... only available there.

the only issues I’ve run into as of yet are 1. the lack of the a-z navigation scroll bar in the Albums section and 2. the lack of a move to front list of recently played albums. re 2. however, I feel this may actually be useful toward encouraging people to diversify their listening, as the design of defaulting to recently played in my experience makes it difficult to spend time finding something I’d like to listen to (either new or archived in my albums section) when my attention is already so contested by everything else. 

so yeah, I actually like what I said was my second complaint, and thinking back had thought about that before. being able to scroll quickly through the albums seems like a good interaction to keep, however.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-06-19T11:49:06-07:00

I do not have too many complaints since it is free and if you are uncomfortable with the free version of the app, there is always the free version. One of my only complaints about the app is, when you search for an album and want to see more songs from a certain album, in the mobile version, you can't access the full album, and now you can't even see the songs that you yourself put on your playlist. What is the point of doing that??  Please fix that, it's useless. It is very annoying. 

Another complain I have is when your playlist ends, you get a radio recommending you songs that could match your taste. There is an option where you can see the songs you’ve listened to recently but when it comes to the radio songs, they’re never registered. I know the like button is an option but sometimes you’re busy and can’t really click the like button.

I also don’t like how there’s a specific folder just for getting premium on the mobile version because heck, you can’t even buy it from there, you have to go online and that just kinda defeats the purpose of putting a whole folder there. If you want to advertise it that bad, just put it somewhere else. 
Also, the ads are so loud! I get it, you want our attention, but how the heck am I supposed to listen to your “quality music” in premium if I lose my hearing while hearing an ad for it? Seriously, chill. 
I know that you’re only allowed 6 skips per hour as a non-premium member, but I’ve noticed that you have to be listening to music in that hour in order for that to happen, which is dumb.

I only have two complaints. 
One is that in the playlists that the app creates for you, it tends to only play songs that you have already listened to multiple times (in shuffle lol) or popular, similar ones. If I follow an artist, there should be an option to mix their more obscure music with the popular stuff. If a playlist is ""made for me,"" it should be able to play whatever it is I like, whether it's a superstar's most popular hit songs, or the most obscure songs released by a guy with 500 listeners. It's not a radio station; it only has to cater to the tastes of one specific person.
Secondly, there should be a way to add, if not entire artists, then at least full albums to playlists that you're creating from the app. I follow over fifty artists, and if I like all of their music, I don't want to add all 3000+ of their songs individually.

Also there is no bar on the side of the screen that shows the letters in which you can find the song alphabetically which there was earlier when “liked songs” was “saved songs” this makes it difficult to find certain songs, because I can’t just go down to the letter anymore. Also with the shuffle on my “liked songs”, if my filter is on to sort by title and I click “shuffle play” usually the same four songs play.  I really thing the shuffling algorithm needs to be fixed because I’m not enjoying the other songs I want to listen on my “liked songs”.

Usability: When I’m using it for downloading Podcasts quite frequently I am not in an area where I have cell service when I want to listen to them. I have to trick the application into playing my podcast because it just continually says that I have no data. Then comes to hunt for where the podcasts are stored. It often takes minutes for the application to actually find or open the location that the files stored in. Reliability: This application crashes more than any other one that I have on my iPhone SE. I also have a Samsung note 10 thatExperiences the same issues so I know it’s not a platform problem. It is completely inconceivable that I am paying as much money as I am every year for such unreliability…..you know what, WAS paying. After putting it in print form and reading it back I realize that it is not worth the money. Canceling today.    Update: Glad I stopped paying, there is no difference if you’re a podcast listener.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-02T10:51:30-07:00

Sometimes this even happens when adding a song to another playlist. Very frustrating. I’m also curious why the ‘not interested’ feature was removed. This app has a problem with recommending albums I’ve listened to many times or going back to the same handful of albums to recommend. Sometimes it’ll keep those in the recommended for months at a time. I thought the ‘not interested’ feature would help fix that when I realized it was a feature. But it was removed shortly after. Also, I would love if the home page had at least some consistency. I want my recently played to be there always. I use that to store my ‘listen later’ albums. Right now, my recently played row is gone and I can’t access it. I would also love if what is popular wasn’t pushed on my home page so much. I don’t listen to a single one of any of those artists and I’m not interested.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-30T21:04:55-07:00

All of my saved artists are no longer there, and my “Artists” tab only shows artists I’ve “followed,” and takes me to the artists’ page and not the albums or songs I have saved. The interface is completely different. I chatted on their website with support for over two hours, only to have the person tell me that the feature I have used every day for years never existed . This is a basic function since the inception of the MP3 player. 

I have been a premium subscriber for more than 5 years, and this has made me seriously consider other streaming services. I have over 10,000 songs that I’ve saved or “liked” over the years, and to only be able to sort by album or song is terrible. Not to mention, BEFORE the update, it was a pain to navigate the Artists page because there is no scroll bar or alphabet to the side to help you navigate - you would have to scroll past hundreds of artists to get to the one you wanted if you wanted to listen to a band that started with “T.”

This doesn’t seem to be a problem on any other iPhones, but the latest update affected my desktop app on my work computer, as well. When this is fixed, I’d gladly adjust my review back to 5 stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-14T17:17:12-07:00

For whatever reason, it is playing songs in my library that I either rarely listen to or it’s not catching onto the vibe I’m going for.

     I understand that maybe some people don’t find this very annoying, but, I do. So, if you made it to where you could turn off the automatically adding songs in settings, then, that would be wonderful.

        My third and final complaint is that I miss being able to play 1 song over and over again.

My main problem with the new update is the fact that you can’t play the songs you have inside a playlist you can only play the playlist and it will shuffle through the songs you have in that playlist. Most of the time when I use a playlist I categorize songs that make me feel a certain way so when I’m feeling that emotion I can go into that playlist and listen to the song I want; however with the new update I can’t pick which song I start with and it really annoys me. I also hate all the new options and how much guess work has to happen. I much prefer the old set up and navigation to the new one and would like there to be some kind of settings option to go back to the old version or to just scrap this dumpster fire of a new set up all together.

Once you have a hundred or so artists, hundreds of albums, and thousands of songs in your library rooting through them on a daily basis is untenable. Previously I could just see the last 20 or so albums I played in an easy to use screen that was basically the landing pad for “your library”. This was basically what I used to decide what to listen to on a daily basis. Aside from being moved it now uses a large tile format that requires much more scrolling for the same information. Really inconvenient when im driving and trying to change albums. Most importantly though it cant be edited. So now if I listen to 4 or 5 one offs I can’t delete them to keep my most favored albums in tact. I have to wait for them t roll off and can never retrieve the albums they bumped from the list.

Now the most recent update has eliminated organization of your music by artist. Also instead of having a ‘liked songs’ library, it is now a playlist called ‘liked songs’. That’s not detrimental but it seems mighty dumb and pointless. 
My biggest gripe is with the ruining of the artists library tab. Instead of showing artists you have music saved from, it shows artists you follow (i don't follow any because it seems redundant to both save an artist’s music AND follow them around). Below your followed artists, it has recommended artists based on what you listen to but even if you select those, it will play songs by the artist that you haven't saved. So now it seems that the only way to listen to only the songs you like from a specific artist without the songs you didn't save is to create a playlist with those songs alone. Entirely defeating the purpose of any part of this app other than playlists. I dont really listen to music by playlists, i prefer to listen by artist (not every song by the artist, just the songs by the artist i like) so this app is pretty useless at this point.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-06-27T11:23:19-07:00

This app was once great, became annoying and has finally slipped into useless.  The features (when not crashing) are exactly what I want like building a library of favorite podcasts, artists, creating playlists, play speed options, and filtering of lists. That became annoying when filters would get lost between uses.  EVERY time you need to re-select “Show Unplayed” because “No, I don’t want to scroll through every episode that I already heard just to get to unplayed episodes.”
It also got annoying when the app would no longer advance after successfully playing through 3-4 episodes or songs.  Then the controls went intermittent. Like the advance 15 second function would not work, or the pause button wouldn’t work so that the only way to stop was to shut down the app.
Today is CRASH day. Select the 15 second advance button to totally close the app. Restarted the app and selected “Play” just to have it crash. Removed and reinstalled the app - you guessed it, 2 minutes into a podcast the app crashed when I selected NO buttons.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T05:00:50-07:00

I love the interface it’s pretty easy to get used to and to navigate. I also love the eq mixer on the app. However i hate that for a music app, it doesn’t offer a higher quality music for audiophiles. I personally don’t get this decision, I have loved this app for so long, but the more I go on it, the more I fall in love with music. This naturally evolved to wanting higher quality music and I was disappointed to learn how low Spotify’s quality really is. I have been a premium memeber for a long time, and I had to switch over to Tidal for my higher quality streaming. I would much rather pay extra for Spotify’s algorithm, interface, streaming options if they were to add a lossless or cd quality memberships. It was with a heavy heart that I had to cancel my subscription purley based on this. I have bought a great system that could support this quality for a lot of money, I also now pay almost 30$ for Tidal and I would much rather spend my money here than there.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-13T03:56:09-07:00

My one peeve is the ""Similar songs"" feature (or problem, depending on where you come from). I listen to a very set group of songs, because there is some music out there that I think is a little crude. Yes, I have the ""no explicit songs"" feature turned on, but I'm pretty strict with what I like. I don't like how when I listen to an album, the app will start to play songs from some totally different band. I look through what songs are in the album, and the one that's playing is not on the list.
If I want to find new music I'll go look for it. I don't want to be doing my schoolwork, listening to songs that help me stay focused, and all of a sudden get distracted by wondering what the heck this song is.
I have the ""Don't play other songs when album is finished"" set to 'on', but this is coming smack within the middle of the album. I haven't listened to all the songs yet. 
If you guys can fix this ""playing suggested track"" problem, this would be a hands down five-star app. But the suggested tracks are really that much if a problem, so for now its three stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-14T07:49:31-07:00

The “tap now to watch a short video for 30 mins of ad free music” link doesn’t always work. Or yesterday I watched the ad then proceeded to hear two more ads right after, heard two songs, then three more adds. I get that I have the free version and I’m fine with the adds once in awhile but if you’re going to say do this thing to not hear ads then play them anyway, that’s misleading and makes me not want to use this app. Also, on occasion songs with just stop playing in the middle. The screen says it’s playing, but it isn’t. Only way to fix that is to exit out of the app then reopen. Super inconvenient when listening in the shower....

**edit: this has happened many times now where I listen to the ad that’s supposed to give me 30 mins without ads then proceeds to play multiple ads back to back then a song then 4 more ads.

***edit: it’s also frustrating when the listen to this ad and get 30 mins of ad free comes up and you click the link and it doesn’t let you click it. What’s up with that? It says it’s not supported on this device or something?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-17T06:09:59-07:00

8084948922,badboychronic,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id29755148,8.6.84,4,Love it but needs work,Ok adding the new update to the start . You can no longer Organize the playlist? I use can move a new song to the top well you can’t do that anymore. So I have to start a new playlist and add them in the order I want this will not do . I copied to a 3 party program that will let me. It’s a backup I always Used. If you spend years making your playlist you may want to do the same . I don’t want to go down over a 500 long playlist to hear my best new stuff. The 3rd party program copy’s songs to do it but you do what you got to. I like the people getting paid but why take control from the users ? Anyways here is my old review I’m starting to think is this with ads to find new music and just make your own playlist using your way. You have new music Friday but some times I can’t get to it and when I hit download and save list it updates to the next new music Friday. Most of my best playlist come from that sure it’s 3 songs out of the list but I don’t want to miss those songs fix this or tell me have to save it before it’s gone ?,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-01T15:39:22-07:00

9778900444,ALILI0818,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id587130413,8.8.22,3,Unnecessary updates,"I love the artists featured and the the aesthetic of the app but updates keep complicating things that shouldn't be complicated. Why can I not see radio/recommended songs when I click on “songs recommended”? Literally who in their right mind ASK to try to see the radio and we see the SEARCH BAR? Literally no one. Who asked for the hearts to be taken away so we would have a harder time adding songs to the basic liked songs playlist? Literally no one. And y'all are still being dragged for overall having a bad radio variety and playing the same 50 songs. In my opinion, radio should be based on not only the artist played, but also caring more about the genre it's under rather than popularity and playing the same 5 people. People thought paying premium would make listening on the app less insufferable but I guess not. I still like the app but seriously? Stop making dumb and pointless decisions because there is a valid reason people are turning to Bandcamp and Apple Music. Just let the app be functional like it was just less than a month ago and stop embarrassing yourselves.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-02T06:36:37-07:00
