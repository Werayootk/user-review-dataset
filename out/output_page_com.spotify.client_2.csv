At the moment I have counted the app crashing 8 times within the hour. I am on all of the latest app version and iOS. Another issue I have. You used to be able to go into an artist album and look at the songs and preview play them, now you can‚Äôt, this is extremely annoying when I‚Äôm trying to preview songs to add to my playlists. It was fine before but they are always changing it. Another issue I have are ads. There used to be 2-3 ads about every 30 minutes with the occasional ‚Äúwatch the video to get 30 minutes ad free‚Äù ad. Now, ads every 2-3 songs and when the watch video ad comes up, I still end up watching two more ads after the ‚Äúso called‚Äù only video. The list goes on and on with things.

I now must go to App Library. Creating more steps and confusion, due to the library shuffling unless pinned. Even if you have playlist pinned it is not found on the top of the home page anymore. I would love to revert this last update. Less convenient than more. PLEASE FIX/ REVERT.

I‚Äôve been listening to the same ads on repeat for weeks. It gets tedious when I have the same nonsense spouted at me for hours worth of time. Another issue I have is the dislike ad feature. When you dislike an ad you shouldn‚Äôt hear it as often as you would normally right? But it seems as if this app hates me because when I dislike an ad it just plays it MORE often. Another issue, suggested songs. Suggested songs is a great feature, however, I‚Äôve been having issues with it. I would be listening to a 3 hour long playlist, and only after hearing 9-10 songs off that playlist it would start suggesting songs. Songs should only be suggested after almost every song has played?

Generally these changes are a substantial UI improvement and navigating between various views is far more intuitive now that the notion of a my library home page, with all relevant shortcuts to artists, podcasts,... only available there.

the only issues I‚Äôve run into as of yet are 1. the lack of the a-z navigation scroll bar in the Albums section and 2. the lack of a move to front list of recently played albums. re 2. however, I feel this may actually be useful toward encouraging people to diversify their listening, as the design of defaulting to recently played in my experience makes it difficult to spend time finding something I‚Äôd like to listen to (either new or archived in my albums section) when my attention is already so contested by everything else.

What is the point of doing that??  Please fix that, it's useless. It is very annoying. 

Another complain I have is when your playlist ends, you get a radio recommending you songs that could match your taste. There is an option where you can see the songs you‚Äôve listened to recently but when it comes to the radio songs, they‚Äôre never registered.

I only have two complaints. 
One is that in the playlists that the app creates for you, it tends to only play songs that you have already listened to multiple times (in shuffle lol) or popular, similar ones. If I follow an artist, there should be an option to mix their more obscure music with the popular stuff. If a playlist is ""made for me,"" it should be able to play whatever it is I like, whether it's a superstar's most popular hit songs, or the most obscure songs released by a guy with 500 listeners. It's not a radio station; it only has to cater to the tastes of one specific person.
Secondly, there should be a way to add, if not entire artists, then at least full albums to playlists that you're creating from the app. I follow over fifty artists, and if I like all of their music, I don't want to add all 3000+ of their songs individually.

Sometimes this even happens when adding a song to another playlist. Very frustrating. I‚Äôm also curious why the ‚Äònot interested‚Äô feature was removed. This app has a problem with recommending albums I‚Äôve listened to many times or going back to the same handful of albums to recommend. Sometimes it‚Äôll keep those in the recommended for months at a time. I thought the ‚Äònot interested‚Äô feature would help fix that when I realized it was a feature.

All of my saved artists are no longer there, and my ‚ÄúArtists‚Äù tab only shows artists I‚Äôve ‚Äúfollowed,‚Äù and takes me to the artists‚Äô page and not the albums or songs I have saved. The interface is completely different. I chatted on their website with support for over two hours, only to have the person tell me that the feature I have used every day for years never existed . This is a basic function since the inception of the MP3 player. 

I have been a premium subscriber for more than 5 years, and this has made me seriously consider other streaming services. I have over 10,000 songs that I‚Äôve saved or ‚Äúliked‚Äù over the years, and to only be able to sort by album or song is terrible. Not to mention, BEFORE the update, it was a pain to navigate the Artists page because there is no scroll bar or alphabet to the side to help you navigate - you would have to scroll past hundreds of artists to get to the one you wanted if you wanted to listen to a band that started with ‚ÄúT.‚Äù

Now the most recent update has eliminated organization of your music by artist. Also instead of having a ‚Äòliked songs‚Äô library, it is now a playlist called ‚Äòliked songs‚Äô. That‚Äôs not detrimental but it seems mighty dumb and pointless. 
My biggest gripe is with the ruining of the artists library tab. Instead of showing artists you have music saved from, it shows artists you follow (i don't follow any because it seems redundant to both save an artist‚Äôs music AND follow them around). Below your followed artists, it has recommended artists based on what you listen to but even if you select those, it will play songs by the artist that you haven't saved. So now it seems that the only way to listen to only the songs you like from a specific artist without the songs you didn't save is to create a playlist with those songs alone. Entirely defeating the purpose of any part of this app other than playlists. I dont really listen to music by playlists, i prefer to listen by artist (not every song by the artist, just the songs by the artist i like) so this app is pretty useless at this point.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-06-27T11:23:19-07:00

Other than that problem it is great just don‚Äôt expect to only hear songs on your playlist you create because I don‚Äôt have that problem when I‚Äôm listening to a playlist someone else or even the app made just the ones I created.!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-09T13:03:25-07:00

It is made very nicely, and although it does have an occasional advertisement, that does not possibly amount to the overall amazing quality. Definitely worth getting the premium membership feature (I don‚Äôt own it, but have used it before with a close friend of mine.) This app is a must-have if you have a busy lifestyle and love listening to music!
  One of my favorite features is the playlist option. You can make customized playlists to your music preference. It‚Äôs positively amazing!
  You can also add certain artists you like, and it customizes your daily mixes.
  Another great feature is the daily mixes! The app gives you daily playlists based on your favorite songs and artists, and makes a personal playlist based on the aforementioned favorite songs and artists.
  Altogether, it is a spectacular app that has MANY amazing features, and I‚Äôm not surprised it is so popular and successful. I hope everyone can notice the amazing quality and effort that was put into the making of this AMAZING app!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2018-09-25T19:03:29-07:00

This app was once great, became annoying and has finally slipped into useless.  The features (when not crashing) are exactly what I want like building a library of favorite podcasts, artists, creating playlists, play speed options, and filtering of lists. That became annoying when filters would get lost between uses.  EVERY time you need to re-select ‚ÄúShow Unplayed‚Äù because ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to scroll through every episode that I already heard just to get to unplayed episodes.‚Äù
It also got annoying when the app would no longer advance after successfully playing through 3-4 episodes or songs.  Then the controls went intermittent. Like the advance 15 second function would not work, or the pause button wouldn‚Äôt work so that the only way to stop was to shut down the app.
Today is CRASH day. Select the 15 second advance button to totally close the app. Restarted the app and selected ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù just to have it crash. Removed and reinstalled the app - you guessed it, 2 minutes into a podcast the app crashed when I selected NO buttons.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-07T05:00:50-07:00

I love the interface it‚Äôs pretty easy to get used to and to navigate. I also love the eq mixer on the app. However i hate that for a music app, it doesn‚Äôt offer a higher quality music for audiophiles. I personally don‚Äôt get this decision, I have loved this app for so long, but the more I go on it, the more I fall in love with music. This naturally evolved to wanting higher quality music and I was disappointed to learn how low Spotify‚Äôs quality really is. I have been a premium memeber for a long time, and I had to switch over to Tidal for my higher quality streaming. I would much rather pay extra for Spotify‚Äôs algorithm, interface, streaming options if they were to add a lossless or cd quality memberships. It was with a heavy heart that I had to cancel my subscription purley based on this. I have bought a great system that could support this quality for a lot of money, I also now pay almost 30$ for Tidal and I would much rather spend my money here than there.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-13T03:56:09-07:00

My one peeve is the ""Similar songs"" feature (or problem, depending on where you come from). I listen to a very set group of songs, because there is some music out there that I think is a little crude. Yes, I have the ""no explicit songs"" feature turned on, but I'm pretty strict with what I like. I don't like how when I listen to an album, the app will start to play songs from some totally different band. I look through what songs are in the album, and the one that's playing is not on the list.
If I want to find new music I'll go look for it. I don't want to be doing my schoolwork, listening to songs that help me stay focused, and all of a sudden get distracted by wondering what the heck this song is.
I have the ""Don't play other songs when album is finished"" set to 'on', but this is coming smack within the middle of the album. I haven't listened to all the songs yet. 
If you guys can fix this ""playing suggested track"" problem, this would be a hands down five-star app. But the suggested tracks are really that much if a problem, so for now its three stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-14T07:49:31-07:00

The ‚Äútap now to watch a short video for 30 mins of ad free music‚Äù link doesn‚Äôt always work. Or yesterday I watched the ad then proceeded to hear two more ads right after, heard two songs, then three more adds. I get that I have the free version and I‚Äôm fine with the adds once in awhile but if you‚Äôre going to say do this thing to not hear ads then play them anyway, that‚Äôs misleading and makes me not want to use this app. Also, on occasion songs with just stop playing in the middle. The screen says it‚Äôs playing, but it isn‚Äôt. Only way to fix that is to exit out of the app then reopen. Super inconvenient when listening in the shower....

**edit: this has happened many times now where I listen to the ad that‚Äôs supposed to give me 30 mins without ads then proceeds to play multiple ads back to back then a song then 4 more ads.

***edit: it‚Äôs also frustrating when the listen to this ad and get 30 mins of ad free comes up and you click the link and it doesn‚Äôt let you click it. What‚Äôs up with that?

I use can move a new song to the top well you can‚Äôt do that anymore. So I have to start a new playlist and add them in the order I want this will not do . I copied to a 3 party program that will let me. It‚Äôs a backup I always Used. If you spend years making your playlist you may want to do the same . I don‚Äôt want to go down over a 500 long playlist to hear my best new stuff. The 3rd party program copy‚Äôs songs to do it but you do what you got to. I like the people getting paid but why take control from the users ? Anyways here is my old review I‚Äôm starting to think is this with ads to find new music and just make your own playlist using your way. You have new music Friday but some times I can‚Äôt get to it and when I hit download and save list it updates to the next new music Friday. Most of my best playlist come from that sure it‚Äôs 3 songs out of the list but I don‚Äôt want to miss those songs fix this or tell me have to save it before it‚Äôs gone ?,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-01T15:39:22-07:00

Why can I not see radio/recommended songs when I click on ‚Äúsongs recommended‚Äù? Literally who in their right mind ASK to try to see the radio and we see the SEARCH BAR? Literally no one. Who asked for the hearts to be taken away so we would have a harder time adding songs to the basic liked songs playlist? Literally no one. And y'all are still being dragged for overall having a bad radio variety and playing the same 50 songs. In my opinion, radio should be based on not only the artist played, but also caring more about the genre it's under rather than popularity and playing the same 5 people. People thought paying premium would make listening on the app less insufferable but I guess not. I still like the app but seriously? Stop making dumb and pointless decisions because there is a valid reason people are turning to Bandcamp and Apple Music.
