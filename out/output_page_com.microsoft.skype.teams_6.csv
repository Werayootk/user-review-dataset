URGENT! 1) To match the functionality of Zoom on iPad OS, the camera should remain on when in slide over/split screen mode. This is ESSENTIAL. 
 2) On iPad, allow users to open chat/participant list in a sidebar while still viewing the participants in the call. The fact that the entirety of the screen is taken up by chat and participant list is a major frustration when monitoring groups and/or chat. 
 3) In-call support keyboard shortcuts for muting/unmuting, opening chat, participant list (at a minimum).

Clicking on a new notification only brings you to an outdated link to older versions of posts.
New notifications aren’t marked read after you click on them.

The interface is clunky and disorganized, so is tagging users to posts.
Team calls have an excruciating delay, and often cut out, so users are constantly interrupting each other, and repeating themselves.
To make things worse, tasks cannot be created in Teams, so an entirely separate app like Planner has to be used for that, even though both applications are owned by Microsoft.
I’m forced to use this atrocity of a software application only because my boss insists it works well. So if you like it, and you agree with him, well then bully for you.

Would have been a 5 star rating although when you open the app and you miss a bunch of messages it will notify you at the top of the app one by one. This can get frustrating if you were in a direct message and you are trying to get back to all your chats as the button to go back constantly gets hidden from the notifications. If this can be adjusted it would truly make navigating more effective and user friendly appropriate for 5 stars!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-16T18:17:35-07:00

If something is discussed in a call, I feel the need to recap in an email so the participants (myself included) can correct something that may have been Mis-stated.

The limit of how many channels will show is inconvenient for bigger teams.  Threading is not quite up to what Slack does (there is a Threads view there that shows things you have interacted with that have further updates).  Slack bots integration also better.

You can connect with other people very easily and the audio is absolutely perfect.
There is something I would like to talk about though: When I share my screen with other people in the meeting, my camera automatically turns off and people can only see the two initials of my name. Can you please find a way in which when the presenter shares their screen, their camera is still on and other people can still see their face?
Other than that, everything is totally amazing and I totally recommend this app to everyone. This wonderful app quickly connects the community together, especially during this difficult time.

The iPad becomes too hot to handle comfortably and the screen goes through a series of dimming / power down stages just to it keep running.

Add contact does not make the text field active, so you have to reach for the mouse again.  Annoying.

Edit is right next to delete.  I use edit a lot.

Delete is an immediate action. 

Buttons are small. 

Text is small and no way to increase size by a point or two.

Speech bubbles are a waste of space.

The feeling I have when using most MS products is frustration.  It’s a shame.  

It all adds up to typical MS design.  They need to spend more time on UX.   It takes time to get right, but MS product typically have a lot of low hanging fruit in this area, that if they tackled, it would make a world of difference.

I came from Slack, and when I first started using teams, it struck me how unintuitive the UI was.  Common, important features hidden away.  Felt like Windows 8 all over again.

While the desktop version is wonderful, the app is HORRIBLE. Many students rely on their phones for access, and the app version fails to provide the required assignment tab for full functionality.
