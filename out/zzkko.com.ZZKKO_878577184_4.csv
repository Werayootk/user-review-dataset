They made me wait another week on top of the week it had already been late. Offered me 50 cents (50 SHEIN points) initially for the “inconvenience” then gave me a full refund for my order a week later. Package has not been moved or found. I have no updates. It’s been almost a month now. I would not recommend such uncertainty or carelessness.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-28T15:23:32-07:00
