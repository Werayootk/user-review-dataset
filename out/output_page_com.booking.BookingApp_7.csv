Would be better to have curtain for the beds. 
Having several private bed and bath and I think they are working on this.

Absolutely no place to put a weeks worth of clothes. No dressers or closet 
No hand or face soap at the bathroom sink just body lotion in both dispensers
Dangerous flooring in bath no bath mat.

Great TV however you go to the channel guide everything says “ no show information” time between changing makes you frustrated looking for your channel choices. We gave up and shut it off.

No place for us both to just sit and chill maybe snack at a table with the free coffee offered. Either lye down or nothing. 
One chair no couch, yikes. 
Note: went for the “free” breakfast.. eggs were cold and salty, sausage also cold threw out both, grabbed a bagel and butter toasted it took a coffee and went back to our room. Coffee was good, bagel not so much….

I get the run around saying it has to be refunded through spirit then spirit says it has to be through booking I paid them not spirit. So then I finally get someone on the phone and I’m told it’s nothing they can absolutely due. I call my bank to get the money and booking don’t want to own up this this fraudulent activity they’re using. So I was told I would possible receive a credit. I have no credit for 203 and literally 6 days later after cancellation I receive a cancellation email from them. Which is weird cause I canceled within the 24hr mark and have a screen shot of a time stamp to prove it.

The place I ultimately booked after researching EVERYWHERE else was the first one the app suggested (and was the best value after all the enticing per-night rates got totally eclipsed by exorbitant deposits and cleaning fees). 2. THEN, as I was checking out, I was offered an enticing upgrade: a better room for just $11 more. What? Better than this? They offered an upgrade to a double queen (which I had passed up for that sweet single king for $11 less). (see #1).

Stayed three days(booked ahead), had No maid service the entire stay! Ran out of towels & TP. You can open & close the door while sitting on the toilet !
Room was not ready when we arrived ( we were 15 minuets early before check in but waited even longer than that.
Saw a cleaning lady going from room to room of people that left, using the same bucket of dirty water in each room. 
They are painting the outside, so a lot of the windows were covered in plastic. They should update the inside first before doing the outside. You can not charge your phone( the outlets were on the side of headboard which was somewhat recessed into the wall with less than a inch to plug anything in & forget using a cube! You could use the plug by the desk if you left the light on but it’s on a timer & goes out after about 10 min.
Mattress & pillows were awful. Breakfast was not good & people were eating in their pj’s. One friendly staff was at check in other than tha we didnt see many . There was a girl at the desk on our last night. That was very rude when we asked her a question.

The app price is attractively low but the true price is upsettingly much higher aside from resort fee, parking, taxes, etc. Unfortunately, cancelling through the hotel and booking is difficult. They seem to be pinpointing at each other. I ended up not getting even a little of refund. I never did learn my lesson. Since the app is easy to use, I booked again and unfortunately, had the same experience.

They gave me the room Joachin, next to the kitchen, it was very noisy until the kitchen closed and the room was infested with mosquitoes.
The following day I asked to change and even before I said it, they acknowledged that it was a noisy room, how can they rent a room which is not suitable!!!
The following night I was in the 3rd floor room which is nice and silent.
As I was staying one more night I left my things in the bathroom and my shampoo strangely disappeared after the room was cleaned. I asked the receptionist to ask the cleaning where she put it, the answer was she did not remember a shampoo.
Finally I had to pay the staying tax for 2 although I was the only occupant of the room.
All these details added made my stay very disappointing.
It is an expensive hotel and there shouldn’t be any trust issues with the staff.

Chris was an amazing host. Not only he gave us a lot of tips but helped us in many ways. Among others, he gave us very good quality ponchos that we used every day (it rained on and off every day), there were umbrellas and our room had binoculars that we enjoyed.

The only complaint was that the hallway by our room smelled musty-almost like there was mold. Not sure if it was the ice machine, the vents or something else. The hallway appeared clean-but the smell was a bit much.
