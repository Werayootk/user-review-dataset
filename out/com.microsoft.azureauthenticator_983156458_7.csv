I get signed in but then the app tells me to enter the code, but the app isn’t generating any code. I go to aka.ms/mfasetup on my work computer where I get the set message and have the same issue. When I was adding this to my upgraded phone, I was able to get a QR code once I navigated to that website on my work computer and was able to sign on that way but  today I’m not getting any other options. Idk what to, my help desk says it should be as simple as downloading it and adding my account again. I’ve removed the connected account, deleted the app, reinstalled the app and added my account again but keep getting stuck at the same screen with no code generating.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-05T05:46:01-07:00

10775640253,Titan of Aces,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id182062680,6.8.2,5,Please add folders or groupings,This is a great app and I’ve been using it for as long as I can remember. I’m at a point where I have too many Authenticator numbers I need to scroll through to get to the one I’m looking for. If we could have a way to set up folders or groups so it can just be two levels would be great. That way I can just touch the “work” group folder and get to my work stuff or “gaming” “personal” etc. Two taps is a lot quicker than going to the search bar and typing out the name of the one I want.

Nevertheless I feel just a little bit comfortable knowing that Microsoft Authenticator will allow a safe guard some files I didn’t give permission to someone to access.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T09:36:21-07:00
