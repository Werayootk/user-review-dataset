The app was installed but the settings gone and configurations. It was a nightmare to have to go and get all my accounts reset that I use Authenticator for.

2. Ability to change color on each account
3. A more visual timer 

I have a lot of accounts I use for 2FA. If there was an easier way to differentiate between them and have a better visual countdown timer it would awesome.  It‚Äôs still a great app though.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-13T06:01:36-07:00

This I have to download an app that I will only use once.
While it is no big deal because I can just go back and delete this app it feels like a over done process
But this app does help those who may truly need it so I gave a star
Still annoying the college required students to get it",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-24T14:22:30-07:00

Offer an apple watch version which would be a perfect use of the watch but then it doesn‚Äôt work. How frustrating.
