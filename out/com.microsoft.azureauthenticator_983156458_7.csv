10775640253,Titan of Aces,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id182062680,6.8.2,5,Please add folders or groupings,This is a great app and I’ve been using it for as long as I can remember. I’m at a point where I have too many Authenticator numbers I need to scroll through to get to the one I’m looking for. If we could have a way to set up folders or groups so it can just be two levels would be great. That way I can just touch the “work” group folder and get to my work stuff or “gaming” “personal” etc. Two taps is a lot quicker than going to the search bar and typing out the name of the one I want. Thanks.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-02T10:17:23-07:00

10763554818,🌸DFamily🌸,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id435672952,6.8.2,5,Feel a little comfortable,I know that there will not be 100% fix or prevention from a data breach. Nevertheless I feel just a little bit comfortable knowing that Microsoft Authenticator will allow a safe guard some files I didn’t give permission to someone to access.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-30T09:36:21-07:00
