After updating my phone number in the app, my account was inexplicably banned within minutes. Efforts to appeal the ban were unsuccessful, as I was met with a permanent ban, just days before Christmas, leaving me stranded without any means to contact my friends and family through the app.\n\nThe support process was equally disheartening. Over several days, the support team provided no clear resolution, repeatedly asking the same questions and offering generic, non-sensical responses. They insisted on verifying my account through the app, which was impossible due to the ban. Moreover, their claim of me violating their terms of service was vague, with no specific details provided. Eventually, they inaccurately accused me of using a third-party app, which was not the case since I only had the official WhatsApp app.\n\nThis ordeal cost me over 6 years of accumulated activity, valuable contacts, and control over a group where I was the admin. The lack of effective support and the arbitrary nature of the ban have significantly diminished my trust in WhatsApp. If it weren't for others using the platform, I would have abandoned it altogether. This has been one of the worst experiences I've had with a service in a long time, and I urge potential users to consider this when deciding to use WhatsApp.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-30T10:32:40-07:00"},{"id":"10765568175","userName":"ALDERHALLY","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1068088075","version":"23.25.85","score":3,"title":"Little Things Matters A LOT","text":"Hello there, Hope this will finds you well.

During the last update few things were changed which i did not really like, 1. When i choose a photo or a video now the newest is on the top left of the screen and not on the bottom right as it used to be. This makes a HUGE difference because in IOS if i TAP on the CLOCK on the top of the screen it will AUTOMATICALLY scroll to the beginning, now when this is reversed, I am missing this feature. 2. Same thing happened to starred messages. Now new on top, not bottom. Same thing I cannot scroll all the way to the beginning by tapping on the clock on top. 3. Now typing in Arabic is just weird, because in Arabic we write from right to left, not like English from left to right. Now if i want to type in Arabic the cursor will remain on the left side of typing panel and words will start moving from left to right, which is not supposed to happen like this.

For years it has been difficult, if not impossible to easily list the groups that you are a member of. As a result, duplicate groups get made because people forget that a similar group had already been created in the past, and there is no easy way to quickly list and edit the groups you are member off. There are hacks you can find on the internet to get around this problem, but for heavy users like me who belong to dozens of groups, this is a source of endless frustration. This last version finally offers a partial workaround, that is that in the new communities section you can pretend to create a new community and see in the process a list of the groups to which you have admin privileges. But this is just another work around, and it does not show you the groups that you are only a member of. For such a mature program to lack such a basic feature passes understanding. If this was 1.0 version of the software I’d give it 4 stars. But for a program that’s been on the market for years, this omission is inexcusable, especially considering that competing platforms allow you to manage groups with ease.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-09T03:52:25-07:00"},{"id":"9407134052","userName":"ThatWhiteGuy747","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id74002931","version":"22.24.81","score":1,"title":"**UNSAFE DO NOT USE**","text":"My account and multiple people I work with all had our accounts hacked on the same day.

The conversation wether individual or in chat groups are more user friendly than WhatsApp. It allows recalling a wrong message sent in mistake. Attaching files and emojis are awesome. My only complain is that once viewed in one device the message cannot be reviewed in an other, which FB allows all history conversation once logged in. \n\nI lived in America over 47 years. I highly recommend friends to use WeChat for daily contacts over other apps.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-10-14T12:29:19-07:00"},{"id":"10695227209","userName":"Villarosadoda","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1601488182","version":"23.25.81","score":1,"title":".","text":"I've done nothing wrong and WhatsApp is my main messaging and communication app, use it to study, work and most important to keep in contact with my immediate family members who live far from me in another country, i have never done anything illegal or against their policy on there and I'm desperate to get my account back.

Please let me know if this is a bug on my phone or it was a problem with the update.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-02-24T17:13:37-07:00"},{"id":"10723379107","userName":"BoredByThisPodcast","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id180597024","version":"23.25.84","score":1,"title":"Horrible","text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Given that a lot of WhatsApp users, use it because they might travel a lot internationally. They might be in different countries and having this app makes it easier to communicate with family and friends when abroad. Of course the way they have the app designed you might be similar situation to me where your contacts from your WhatsApp AREN’T able to message you, but you are able to message them. When I had this issue, I tried to get help from ‎WhatsApp, and I only got generic robotic responses. They don’t have a customer support phone line. The worst part is from to my contacts and it looks like I’m receiving all of their messages (when I am not). And to those that say well, you’re not paying for it I would argue I would happily pay for it if it meant the application worked as it is suppose to. WhatsApp absolutely does not care about the well-being of their app users. They are irresponsible and it’s egregious.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-20T09:19:23-07:00"},{"id":"10269511077","userName":"simsimchuty","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1524471466","version":"23.16.0","score":1,"title":"App issue","text":"😵🤚🏻Hey whatsapp!

Now screen moves up and bottom half turn black and you can’t use the app properly. Every time this requires user to completely close app and re-open it again.\n\nPlease fix these bugs and do more testing before you release updates. \n\nAt least you fixed the more annoying bugs mentioned below. Thanks for that. \n\nDear Developers, this last update totally screwed up the app. - I’m getting blank screens where you can see the text box while typing. - The list of chats keeps moving down before you can select on it (so you enter the wrong chat) or - when stationary it always selects the chat below the one you select. So you have to select another chat to get into the one you want. Seriously? Revert to a previous safe build and do more testing before you push new updates out, it’s becoming annoying enough to make me want to report these bugs in a review. Happy to submit screen shots or video with version/phone info if needed (latest updated iOS and WhatsApp updated). Other then that my only other WhatsApp suggestions is -to allow users to edit or delete their messages (outside of disappearing messages) - to allow chat backup to other drives or apps or make it easier to use","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-18T04:13:08-07:00"},{"id":"9501945049","userName":"docnasef","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id372015523","version":"22.24.81","score":1,"title":"Customer support is NON EXISTENT!","text":"Edit: was asked to contact their development support!! Guess what?? I got the same automated nonsense replies!!! ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATED!!! I have been using WhatsApp for years to be honest but recently my back up feature just stopped working it would be stuck at “preparing” for hours and even a WHOLE DAY!! I am running latest iOS version; the app is up to date; I have tons of free GB in my iCloud+ , my iCloud Drive is on (tried the part about turning off and turning on again) but STILL no back up !! Even tried deleting the whole WhatsApp out of my frustration and isolation and then starting new from scratch ! STILL did not work ! Lost all my conversations and STILL no back up is working !! Through all these steps contacted support and all I get are simple two cents replies : “we will check with concerned technicians” / “send screen shots” / “we will get back to you” etc etc Not much help there ! At ALL!! Been weeks Still nothing ! Really disappointed !","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-13T00:42:44-07:00"}]
