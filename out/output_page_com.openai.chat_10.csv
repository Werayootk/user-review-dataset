It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:
One limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-26T23:09:12-07:00

This is my observation.
I can see that ChatGPT has what I call data bias.  So for example if there was a heated debate ChatGPT would lean in one direction rather that opposing view. 
Some responses have me concerned because at the end of the day due to the biases of the people entering the data may not be 100% factual or some important data may be suppressed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6448311069&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T11:04:53-07:00
