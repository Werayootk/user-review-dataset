OpenAI's services have been incredibly helpful, and I appreciate the capabilities it offers in text-based interactions. However, I would like to suggest the addition of image support. The ability to send and receive images would significantly enhance the utility of this platform.

Including image support could enable users to seek assistance with visual tasks, such as identifying objects, helping with image descriptions, or discussing visual content. It would make the service even more versatile and valuable.

I believe that OpenAI's commitment to innovation and user satisfaction would be greatly enhanced by considering the addition of image support. I look forward to seeing this potential improvement in future updates.

Thank you for your continued dedication to providing excellent AI-powered services.
