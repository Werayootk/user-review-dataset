I'm not a risk taker. But I was board and thought I'd start small and just purchase a few items. Well that turned into 3 hours of shopping in the comfort of my cozy home. My first order was 5 identical Christmas outfits for my preschool class. The deal was amazing and the picture of the outfit was soooooo darling. The total was $30. I was prepared to be disappointed. When I opened that package I felt and seen the outfits. I was in LovE!!!! They are the cutest!!!! I'm so excited to gift them. The next day I got my big order of about 40 random things. My daughter and I made a game out of it. First let me tell you this is the daughter that yells at me for buying junk or over priced items on Facebook . So she was in full mode ready to laugh at me!!! We opened and took one item out at a time. Said if it was quality or junk and then I made her guess the price I paid. She guessed higher on most everything!!! She was smiling and said okay mom you did good üòä. It's just a fun and addicting site.

Temu holds and uses what should be your refund money as operating capital. This year it has required hundreds of hours of my time to peruse resolution. This is a painful process. Sometimes eventually I am issued a return of my funds. Typically this is many months of outrageous negotiation to have them do an effective investigation. Often they refuse my refund after an incomplete investigation. I suggest sending photos of your home, and be diligent asking hundreds of times if that is what it takes. \nThe reward is great.

If you want to buy the stuff, just use the website. The app also has built in ad trackers so they‚Äôre tracking your views and purchases and selling that information, just like Facebook and others do.\n\nAlso, as others have mentioned, the app steals your info.

The real rule is that each invitations you sent out, the price cut gets lower and lower to the point where you‚Äôll never reach zero. Don‚Äôt do it guys. Less you got like a whole family who are going to the ‚Äúnew Temu users who have NEVER downloaded the app before‚Äù. Cuz the existing user is limited to 4. So basically, you had to start inviting new users at one point to cut the price. But by that time, each person you invite will cut less and less. In my case, I have 60 cents left after my 4 existing users. So I thought one new user would be enough to go to zero. But when I got that new user, it only cut the price by 20 cents. And the next one, would cut by 10, and less and less. Basically, as I said, less you got a whole family or friends who are going to be new users, you ain‚Äôt gon get it y‚Äôall. Anyways, it just makes no sense to have such a program and they were just gna waste our time when I‚Äôm actually a pretty loyal customer. Def a cheat there y‚Äôall. Don‚Äôt be like me.

I received and email saying I have been selected to spin the will and get $300 worth of coupons. U selected my items then it asked me to pay the $75 that the items cost. Or it'll say because I'm a valued customer I can select three free items but once I did that then I have to get 5 ppl to sign up for temu and do some other task to receive the free items.

Customer support is basically nonexistent for Temu, and they don't assist customers at all. Temu needs to use trustworthy shipping companies that don't lose huge orders. All of the hours out of days that I spent to find the items that I needed and then order them are down the drain! The order was lost and now Temu expects me to go back through and find the items all over again because the order link does not separate the lost items from the delivered items. It shows that it does, but whenever I click on the shipped but not delivered link, it only takes me back to the entire order altogether. It's far too inconvenient and too time-consuming to do this all over again. Also, on the Wish app, I can save over 1500 items within my wish list. It's the same for the wish list in the Shein app. Temu needs to allow much more to be saved on their wish list because this would make re-ordering items that Temu lost so much easier and much quicker. Also of course, allow the links of items not delivered to actually work for real so that one simple click would re-order those items again.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-02T17:13:45-07:00"},{"id":"9829346961","userName":"jnbraysmommy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id570495531","version":"1.63.0","score":1,"title":"Will rip you off","text":"I play the games within the app to earn free rewards, you have tasks to complete etc. one is called fish land. I‚Äôve been feeding those fish nonstop for weeks. You have like 8 days and so many hours to feed all your fish. I‚Äôve kept track of my time after being told by others their fish land reset before it was due to reset. When this finally happened to me I contacted customer support who wanted to only give me a 20% off coupon to make yet ANOTHER purchase. Let me remind you I‚Äôve ordered several times at this point. Still have TWO orders I‚Äôm waiting to get now. But the rewards for the fish land game are supposed to be free, two free gifts IF you raise all your fish by the deadline. I was 99.4% when they deducted EIGHT hours off my time limit (within one hour time frame of checking it). You only get but so much fish food a day so those hours are crucial to getting that last fish completely raised, especially if they give you the chance to feed past midnight one more time. Don‚Äôt waste your time I‚Äôve literally WASTED my time trying to EARN the rewards like it says to and they rip me off and want to ‚Äúmake it right‚Äù my throwing a coupon my way to have me make another purchase.

It takes a lot of buying and a lot a lot of shares to get ur gifts so they made good good money in gf ne in purchases before I knew about the fish feeding and me sharing w so so many strangers all day to get what‚Äôs really about $40 worth of gifts. Right now it‚Äôs a $15 cup so I‚Äôm rethinking how hard I‚Äôm working and spending so much daily. I should  just buy the dress and sparkling cup it‚Äôs priced at $22  but goes to $5. Positive side I do love free shipping  that got me interested  to start  over  Wish charging shipping w each item overall I will still buy but rethinking the fish land game rushing and feeling pushed by a deadline is no longer fun  Hope my real review helps others  wish somebody explained to me 3 months ago.

And when you try to back out they give a pop up that says ‚Äúthis person earned $$$$‚Äù and put up an impossible amount of money!!! I tried a cookie jar game, where it says ‚Äúinvite new players to drop cookies faster.‚Äù I did this, it says ‚Äú100 cookies = $1‚Äù‚Ä¶ but guess what!!! After you hit the redeem button you then have to spin to earn the money! 1000 cookies equals 1 spin.. and the closer you get, the less you get.. first couple spins was 20 vouchers of 100, but once i got to 93 vouchers of 100, suddenly i was only getting pennys.

I practice witchcraft and also needed new clothes, perfume, decor, etc. I found everything I needed on this app for less than $50! There were also little challenges you could do to get credit, or to get items for free. While many think it is illegitimate, it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs annoying because you have to invite all of your friends to get the items, but in the end it‚Äôs worth it because hey, who doesn‚Äôt want free items? I saw many complaining about packages never arriving or being delayed but that never happened with me. Now, for the important part.\n\nOn behalf of my deletion of this app, it‚Äôs for an important reason. TEMU‚Äôs creators made an app called Pinduoduo which was banned in the US for data leaking and selling, and now TEMU is being investigated by the United States government. If you‚Äôd like to still use it you can but that‚Äôs just a fair warning.

The limit for being able to check out is also frustrating because it goes up everytime we/i buy something. It‚Äôs hard to go up to that limit when we don‚Äôt know what to buy. There could be a feature where on the weekend we could have no limit on purchasing items without having to worry about the spending limit. The games are sometimes rigged and it‚Äôs hard to get new users. I wish there was a bigger limit for existing users. If the games are luck based I think it will be better because there‚Äôs more chances than actually getting new users. I understand that new users are important because new users equals more people using the app and buying stuff. I hope that the games can improve or be like the old version where we could earn a few cents, and become better where we could earn credit easier and faster.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-21T20:01:41-07:00"}]
