Shein and USPS were giving me the run around. I ask them to accommodate me for the inconvenience and sent my package express shipping so that I can receive it and they told me no. I can just get my refund, that my refund will take 7-14 business days. What baffled me was they were quick to take my money, I still haven‚Äôt received neither one of my packages.

Well, I did this and sent my stuff back the very next day which was 12 days ago. I still have no refund or any info or anyone to talk to about it.

I am size m and petite and I was going based on the measurements of the clothing pieces. I kept getting L & XL?? I was going to order based on the reviews and ordered the majority of my clothes in size M and they all fit like a glove.

As I have a wedding coming up, it really caught my attention!  Honestly, I had never heard of SHEIN before, and I did have to do some detective work to track down the dress...and was FLOORED at the price...on sale for $9.00 USD!!! Yes, I was skeptical of the quality, but after reading the many positive reviews on the dress, I figured ‚Äúwhy not???‚Äù I did order two sizes, as I fell between the size measurements.  I received the dresses in LESS THAN ONE WEEK!!! I am VERY impressed....and I actually am planning on keeping both sizes, as the wedding is in September and I have health issues which make my weight fluctuate a bit. WTH...for $9.00 - even two dresses, I would never find even one locally anywhere near that price!   Now, the hunt is on for the perfect pair of heels üë†! I will absolutely order from SHEIN again and will recommend to friends and family! ü¶ã","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-04-06T08:02:36-07:00"},{"id":"9936044220","userName":"Miss E28","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1058573461","version":"9.2.0","score":5,"title":"Avid SHEIN shopper","text":"I have been shopping with SHEIN now for over a year. I have ordered clothes, jewelry, kitchen items, bedroom stuff and bathroom items. I‚Äôve been satisfied with the products SHEIN has to offer. Yes, on occasion I‚Äôve had to return an item of clothing for a different size but that‚Äôs only because everything doesn‚Äôt fit the same.  I‚Äôve ordered things for myself  and my grandchildren and as of yet I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. My 14 year old granddaughter has her own account set up. She‚Äôll put items in her cart and either my daughter or myself will purchase them. I tell others about SHEIN. The ease of placing orders, the quality of the products, the prices, the different coupons you get from time to time. I also let them know when I‚Äôm wearing a SHEIN  piece of clothing, so they can see for themselves. I thank you SHEIN and I will continue to shop with you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-17T05:26:29-07:00"},{"id":"9662709166","userName":"what do you think about shein","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1345746497","version":"8.9.8","score":5,"title":"Why shein Is the best place to find things online","text":"I love shein products facial and skin care clothes are amazing very good type of fabric and a very cheap price and I love how you can add a coupon and if you have a gift card you can add the coupon and the gift card which would make your price very low so you don‚Äôt have to pay that much and I just love shein so much very good online website to use to buy things if you ever need like any facial skin care products you can go on shein and they‚Äôre very cheap and she has so many things you could buy you can buy clothes bracelets shoes socks pajamas skin care lipgloss like you can also buy empty bottles of lipgloss or like little sprays if you‚Äôre ever going out I need perfume we can just have so proud of you on the go instead of taking a whole bottle thank you for reading my review and this is what I think about shein","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-27T16:56:23-07:00"},{"id":"9170308662","userName":"Jaime-Elisa","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1162670079","version":"8.6.0","score":5,"title":"LOVE Shein!","text":"If you know how to measure yourself (or if you can‚Äôt measure yourself but know how to read reviews) Shein is really the best place to go for inexpensive clothing! After having a baby and then living in the pandemic era right after, I was a whole new size when I had to return to my job, not in a good way. I spent the first year in the office rotating the same two pair of dress pants and about 5 shirts that i didn‚Äôt feel good in. I felt gross and frumpy, never put together‚Ä¶until I met SHEIN. Shein (and all the helpful customer reviews on each article of clothing) got me together! If you hit the flash sales and make use of the coupons, you could easily build a decent wardrobe for under 500$, whereas if you go to the mall, that 500$ isn‚Äôt going to get you much at all. I tell everyone i know about this website and app. I can‚Äôt believe i didn‚Äôt know about it sooner!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-10T05:45:11-07:00"},{"id":"9044518938","userName":"Turner319","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id174242839","version":"8.4.6","score":5,"title":"Helped me fill out my wardrobe!!","text":"After I got my first paycheck, I wanted to finally get some new cute clothes to replace my old ones. When I try to buy from shops in person, however, just one cute top can be $20 to $40!! Shein is a place to get clothes at a cheaper price and be able to look at a variety of designs and styles. \nYes, you may make a bad purchase sometimes but you have the option to return and all of the cute clothes you can get is so worth the occasional flop. It‚Äôs also free-shipping on Sundays, so I just build my cart during the week and buy on Sunday. \n\nI do want to say that newcomers should take care to actually measure themselves and look at size charts. I would suggest staying away from jeans and shoes (except maybe flip flops) on the site bc those are just the type of item that you should really try on in store before purchasing.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-09-02T06:12:49-07:00"},{"id":"8910622374","userName":"dhcbajc","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id819599475","version":"8.3.4","score":5,"title":"SHEIN is amazing","text":"You can not go wrong with this app at all. I don‚Äôt usually right reviews about apps but I will for this one! All of there stuff is really good quality. When ording from SHEIN compared to other places they arrive a few days early or exactly on the dot. I‚Äôve been ordering from them for a while now and I‚Äôm really please with the items, the response team when somethings not right or I just have a question there pretty quick with their responses. The app is also really user friendly.  SHEIN has a lot of things to offer, their point system is actually really cool! You can get them a whole punch of ways and you use them to take of amounts of moolah from your orders. You can get them by just checking in, spinning the wheel for points, giving reviews on anything you buy. The more more you write/ review the more points you get.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-25T08:48:28-07:00"}]
