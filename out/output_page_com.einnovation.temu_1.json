I have purchased so far, a bread shaped eyeshadow palette, a beanie, creature bookmark, hair clip. They were all awesome.  Before purchasing I made sure to read reviews and would not buy the item without seeing pictures that people have uploaded during their review. I think that really helped me to get good quality products. I have made another larger purchase since then. Just waiting to receive it. The  first order arrived in less than two weeks, so my second order should arrive in a week or so. That being said, there are some items I don’t know if I would purchase just because I don’t have the extra money to spend  to have it not work or be the quality I wanted to, so I definitely think it’s a great day. I will continue buying from the app. Black Friday Shipping currently is free which I absolutely love. I’m super stoked for my next order to arrive..  some people have compare this to “Wish” which maybe there are items that would be comparable. For me, so far with what I have received, I definitely think that Temu is much better and shipping is quick in comparison.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-25T14:26:08-07:00"},{"id":"10759749917","userName":"Bestie_ThisIsSad","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1375948839","version":"2.32.0","score":3,"title":"Mini Games and Pop Ups","text":"I have bought from the app before and the items come as you expect, fairly high quality for the price but nothing special. \n\nHowever the pop ups on this are insufferable, they literally happen like every 10 seconds. I can’t possibly look through the app without being bombarded with ad after ad after ad for the app I’m already on. One of these pop ups are for free items but will do literally everything in its power to make sure you don’t get any free items. One of the games is a pick 5 items free challenge, the only way you can get any of the items is by referring people to win all of the items- which on its own isn’t that big of a deal. Having to refer someone to get points on an app isn’t anything new. Expect it will actively lower your prize money the closer you get to your goal. For example it will promise you $1 for a referral, but if you only need a dollar to get your free items, then suddenly you can only win 25¢ per referral. However it won’t tell you the price is that low, you just go through all the effort to get your friend to download and app, refer them, go through the whole process only for you to not get the money it promised you. It’s very infuriating getting your friends and family to download an app they clearly don’t want only for you to not get the thing you specifically made them download the app for. \n\nThere is no point in having sweepstakes if it’s literally impossible to win the sweepstakes","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-29T10:32:07-07:00"},{"id":"9597875143","userName":"susie107","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id118518765","version":"1.43.0","score":4,"title":"Legit & Addictive","text":"It is better than Wish, quality-wise, though some of the items are the same. It feels like AliExpress but you get your order in less than 10 days (my first one came in 7) as opposed to 1-2 months. I AM glad I gave it a try and hope I don’t blow all my expendable income on it because, while there are a few things I need, most of it is just stuff I want. They do honor the initial 90% off gift and if you have time to play their popularity/annoy your friends game, you can get some great deals. The coupons don’t last long enough at all. The other day I had a $16 off $40 coupon but it expired in 24 hours when I was still building my next cart, so I find myself waiting to make the purchase until I receive a good coupon. I have tried the referral thing to win free items and credits but I’m lame and antisocial so I don’t know enough people and I also don’t have the time to peruse reddit for hours looking for strangers to “click for click” with. It makes me a little frustrated (and obviously just jealous) when I see people who have received 100+ free gifts they’re going to resell just because they are kids with no jobs and spend their days being “influencers” on tik tok-In that regard it feels like a tween’s app, but again, I’m just lame so you may have better luck with the whole “Team Up Price Down” thing.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-02-08T17:54:16-07:00"},{"id":"10431061257","userName":"AmyGoodGorilla407","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1575570504","version":"2.9.0","score":4,"title":"Overall satisfied","text":"Had some issues with an order- I was sent someone else’s order.

I would have preferred they just sent me my original order or sent the money back to my debit card. The only other issue I’ve had is with a third party shipper that they used- Lazer Ship, that company is trash. Had so many issues getting my package and their customer service is literally non existent. There’s a button you click to reach someone on their website, which is a total lie. Your message goes nowhere, nobody reads it. I understand that isn’t TEMU or their company, just warning anyone that has to use them for their packages. They are awful. Again, I am overall satisfied with my shopping experience. Do not be scammed by the games- farmland and fish land seem like fun ways to win or earn free products or coupons but the closer you get to the goal, the harder they get to reach. Very time consuming and all the “free gift” boxes they tell are exclusive to you, are not. The prices never change. It’s just consumer manipulation and again, just a waste of time.

Another thing is I ordered a watch case that held 24 watches it came and it did not hold watches on the foam rubber like the smaller ones did. So I called and was told I would get a refund and just keep the case then a few days later another watch case came and I called and told them I got another watch case and was told to keep it and each one was about 38 dollars so now I have two so guess I'll just have to try them. Then I placed a 1890 dollar order and finally got 3 items out of 18 that I ordered and they were shipped in separate packages and they came on 3 different days so they gave me a refund and 20 dollar coupon. But there are more things but I don't want to go on. I can not tell you how much money I have spent with you but plenty and I love your prices and free shipping. Also they cut out the amount I have to spend before the free shipping. I was shopping with you when it was 10 dollars minimum and it just kept going up so I had decided to stop buying from you so she changed it to any \n   amount. So have already placed two orders.

Their prices are out of this world affordable, and their products are actually good quality unlike some other online shop pining websites. But what I don’t understand is how they make it a 10$ minimum for orders because they want to conserve how much plastic they use, but at the same time they cover they entire thing with tape! I also don’t understand that if you have credit and you have enough to get a free item why you can’t just get that item that is under 10$ and not have to add something else? It would be amazing if you guys could change that policy or at least make it that once a week you don’t have to do a 10$ minimum and that there is no minimum. Other than those two things it’s a great app and I definitely recommend if your looking for some cheap home decor or cute jewelry and clothes! \n\nEdit: \nThe games that are suggesting it’s easy to win a couple free items as well are totally not worth it. I don’t recommend wasting your time on a game trying to get a free item when it is literally impossible to win them. Temu does not give you even a close amount enough of food to be able to feed your fish or water your grass to win the items so instead of trying to get a free Nintendo switch or cargo pants just buy it or wait until you ACTUALLY notice the price went down.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-18T07:29:32-07:00"},{"id":"10386749773","userName":"Priestess Jeanann","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id219125657","version":"2.4.0","score":5,"title":"Where have you been ask my life???","text":"I love this app so much.

Btw, you have the same 48hrs to place another $100 order to use $30 off coupon.

My favorite items so far has been the neat little bucket washing machine that gets my socks and underwear cleaner than a regular washing machine and rechargeable motion sensor lights that detect day/night (that's a lot of cutting edge tech for $7.50!)  These little inexpensive items improve your quality of life, like a drain hair catcher that saves me money on plumbers, a nice quality purse to replace an old one, car blind spot mirrors that can save my life, sanding discs fo repairing paint scratches on my car, dishwashing steel wool, adhesive hooks for jackets, clips that hold my shower curtain in place so it doesn't stick me uncomfortably, and several amazing Apple watch band knockoffs that look like the real thing and cost less than $10!

I was given a refund, no problem, however I was still a little upset with the situation as it left a bad taste in my mouth. So, I go ahead and make another purchase, buying two pairs of pants and a shirt. The shirt was poor quality, but it was pretty cheap, so I was not too mad. But the pants were the problem. I received a pair of jeans that were blue and looked NOTHING like the picture.  And as I opened the package, I discovered they were WET. They were in the package in a secure plastic bag, so I have no idea how they were wet. I can’t imagine it was a shipping issue, because nothing else was wet. And the other pair of pants I received looked nothing like the imagine. Angry with what I received, I contact Temu about the two pairs of pants. And they told me there was nothing I could do without a refund. Here’s the thing - I don’t think I should be forced to use my gas money (I do not live near a postal box) to return my LOW QUALITY items that are NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE of them while they’re wet!!!

Since babies grow so fast, I can’t justify spending a lot of money on their clothes. \nBut getting like to all the pro’s about Temu, their prices are affordable, the order’s always comes before the delivery date they give me and returns are easy and are never questioned. Occasionally, if something is damaged, they will ask for pictures which makes total sense to me. Yes, some of their things are cheaply made but I’ve never had a problem with those things because, for me, they were silly signs I was hanging outside anyway and no sign outside last forever unless you paid big bucks for it and sometimes they don’t last either. \nMy only con would be the packaging is not the best and you most likely won’t be able to return an item in it. I always save my smaller boxes for situations like this. Temu will email you a mailing label and returns are always free. \nSo thank you Temu for being such a great company for me.

The most irritating thing about Temu is the “free gifts.” It’s constantly trying to give me free stuff, and it always gives me the best reward EVEN when I press the X to leave. It always gives you the best gift but practically makes it impossible to get it. It also lied to me and said I would get 30 points for inviting a knew person, and I only got 10!

Countless reviews are clearly negative, yet it shows that the person gave the item 5 stars which is impossible.

I thought it was just going to be like another Wish where your items break 2 minutes later and it takes like three months or more to get your items. I don’t know how but somehow the prices are even cheaper than wish but the products are better quality. And the part I love the most is every few hours you can get free shipping on your entire order. And delivery is very quick. They usually ship your item out the day after or two days after you place the order and depending on where you live it usually gets to you within a week or so. We have like four orders each that we ordered on different days and we’ve already gotten 3 of the packages. I am very pleasantly surprised you’re not only with their items, but with the shipping. Also, my fiancée got the wrong color of something and they very quickly gave her a credit to get the other color within three minutes and as soon as it was about to ship. Very fast and friendly customer service!

Everything on here is so cheap, and all the time, Temu launches a big sale, some coupons, or even free gifts altogether. Some of their items can be a little sketchy, but as long as you're careful, you're practically guaranteed great products for the cheapest price out there.\n\nWhat I've heard about Temu recently is completely the opposite from what I've personally experienced. All the products I've received have good quality, or at least acceptable for the price. I've only ever had one package come late, and when it did, they reimbursed me $10! Extremely rarely, you may find an item or two missing, but it's never anything detrimental.\n\nWhile you may find something missing, or maybe an item doesn't work, you can still apply for a refund. In my case, they gave me a full refund and allowed me to keep the items, and I could donate it as I pleased! They have great customer service and I literally couldn't ask for better! Thank you Temu for the great products and cheap prices!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-24T15:27:39-07:00"},{"id":"10620403970","userName":"kaykisses_","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id542608100","version":"2.22.0","score":1,"title":"Promotion Scams","text":"The promotions they have are very misleading. They use the same tactic every single time. They have many promotions going on at this moment. The 4 free items, the free cash, and farmland just to name a few. They make it simple in the beginning, but then they also lie about what they are going to give you. You get down to $1 away. It says invite a new user for a reward of $1. I did it and the catch was that the new user  also had to claim the 4 rewards by inviting others which is obviously impossible and they know this. In the rules it states the new user just has to accept your invitation which is a lie. Every time you get close to winning your items they make it hard so that you can’t and don’t win. Which is ridiculous. Its the same thing in every promotion they have. Stop misleading people if you aren’t going to actually going to give out a deal. On top of that you can’t pay the remaining balance you have to get everything down to zero. That is because they don’t want to make just .20… they would be losing money. So instead they are scamming us with a reward we will never recieve or reach to get more users. From a point it’s a good business move but in the end you will just end up with several unhappy customers that will catch on and won’t want to shop anymore.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-11-24T08:34:29-07:00"},{"id":"10123108388","userName":"tiny making friends","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1021403513","version":"1.85.0","score":1,"title":"Great shop BUT","text":"Update: I have now heard from two people that their cards/accounts linked to Temu have been drained. So yeah one star. If you don't have it yet, don't get it. Stay safe.\n\nI love that I can get decent quality stuff for low prices. I've spent quite a lot because so many things are so cheap. Temu is smart because they use games where you can win products or store credit, to keep you coming back. (Instead of buying a bunch of stuff once and then never using the app again.) Even smarter, the games often require you to complete tasks like browse for thirty seconds, make purchases, or interact with existing users or recommend new users. Here's the issue. They made the games ridiculously easy to win for the first few months, even without referring a new user, and EVERYONE was cashing out. Then they changed all of the games to be rigged so that you can't win without recommending someone new. But a lot of the games pretend to be chance/luck based. Spin the wheel types, but it's not really luck or chance at all. It's obviously calculated to be unwinnable and it's really frustrating and a bit insulting. I wish they would make the games ACTUALLY chance based, even if that means offering smaller prizes. The way they do it now makes them seem really skeevy and scammy, and damages the trust of their users.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-09T20:32:12-07:00"},{"id":"10027443467","userName":"des4t","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id773595126","version":"1.78.0","score":4,"title":"Quality of purchases","text":"Most of my purchases have been as expected, I have ordered quite a lot and try to always check the sizes before I buy to prevent dissatisfaction, so I shop wisely. Some of the items exceed my expectations of quality and most others are at what I expected. I have an order with a pair of leggings coming and it will be my first clothing purchase, so at this time I can’t comment on clothing. I have ordered diamond art and have been very happy. My makeup purchases have been above what I hoped for. I don’t order large or electronic items, I am not much of a risk taker. I did just get a electronic bark stop device for my insane barker Yorkie dog. I am not expecting success but will let you know later, instructions say up to 2 weeks to work. My biggest complaint would be a lot of the products instructions are not in English or are very poorly written and just contain no instructions at all, but I know for the prices I am paying I feel it is what should be expected and some frustration is going to be part of the game. Also the low prices are enticing me to spend too much! LOL, my own fault.

I never spent money in the game and for to level 27 before deciding I had to quit. It takes more and more of your time and gets super addictive, till all you want to do is play.\nEach level is more difficult to achieve without spending real money, although you can play and have fun as long as you're part of an active alliance. You will end up paying with time instead of money. There is strategy involved, but you'll never reach where you want to be when vou reach on goal there's another just out of reach. The game also has a steep learning curve, if you decide to really play you'll spend hours trying to figure out generals, buff, debuffs, research, ghosting, battlefield, server vs server, and everything else. There's always more to do to compete.\nI'll say I enjoved while I played I made lots of friends had a great server, but in the end it took too much of my time so be aware what you're signing up for.

I checked with my credit card companies and there was no such dispute. I and my credit card companies weren’t disputing anything. My credit number is 812! Meanwhile Temu sent me several messages saying the merchandise I wanted was selling out and that I should place the order. I tried, and they wouldn’t process the order. I tried contTEMU AND IT WAS A BAD JOKE. THEy kept asking ne what the order number was. I didn’t have an order number because Tenu wouldn’t process the order. So I am done with them.

When you reach that goal you receive a free gift a huge coupon bundle and sometime actually cash (supposedly) sent to your PayPal. It starts off strong you instantly receive a bunch of bonuses and it seems like you easily reach your goal. I get the hustle it is effective but the issue is once you get close to the prize the amount of coins you receive is far less then originally then you just stop receiving any coins at all  I got 20 coins per 1 referral at first now I’m at the end I need 10 coins to cash out I’ve done 3 referrals desperately trying to reach the prize and all three show accepted but not a single coin awarded very very frustrating and agitating not a scam because they do have the items at the prices they advertise for and they do send to you when they say they will but their referral program does seem like a scam and has just left a really bad taste in my mouth a really really bad taste","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-29T19:46:32-07:00"},{"id":"9158545142","userName":"Bannister832","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id458342552","version":"1.8.0","score":5,"title":"Pretty good so far","text":"Just purchased 14 items for $12, so we’ll see what the actual price points are like after the new user discount disappears. Seems similar to AliExpress, but with better shipping time, smaller range of products and competitive prices. Two things to be mindful of: 1, There is no favorites or wishlist option. If you want to save something, you have to put it in your cart. You do have the option of selecting and buying just one item, but there’s also the option of sleepily emptying the cart or purchasing everything when you’re just trying to do one of two items. 2, The ratings when you click on a product seem to be for the entire store. When I clicked the reviews to read others opinions, they were filled with other items, to the point that I never saw the item I was looking for in any of the review sections. Will try to remember to come back and update rating based on the quality of the products.

This second time I really really didn’t expect my order ( especially a 4-6 piece order) to be delivered in less then a week.

I don’t expect any of the items I got to be that high quality given the price and how these business models work.\nI would like to warn y’all of the “Freebies” they offer where you go through hoops to spins prize wheels, get energy (through inviting others), and then take a random chance to spin again for the prizes. It says you can invite 3 peo and it’s up to 2 energy per person but what they don’t tell you is the amount of energy you earn goes down with every person. They give you enough energy to get everything but one price on the wheel preventing you from winning all 3 things free. It leaves you 5 energy short and asks to invite others. The first person you invite gives 2 energy, (dope only 2 more invites and I can win my free stuff) but nah. The second invite gave me 1, then .5, then .2.
