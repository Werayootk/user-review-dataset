I put my thrifting bundles up on lots of sights and it’s fine. I payed to ‘bump’ the listing and they took my money then deleted the listing less than 10 hours after. Now they refuse to refund me even though I never got what I payed for. The customer service refuses to refund me as well.

The shipping costs used to be so reasonable. .99 maybe 1.99 or 2.99 if the items were heavier but now even the lightest t shirt.. the shipping cost is like $6-$12. That is a HUGE increase and isn’t worth buying anything anymore.
