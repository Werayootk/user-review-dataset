1.Have the ability to schedule messages. Manny times we want to send a message to a relative or an employee that is important they see first thing in the morning, but it‚Äôs 1:00am and we don‚Äôt want to bother them. I could set an alarm to wake up and send the message at 6am but, this is inconvenient because I was up all night, just got to bed at 3am and I just want to sleep. 

Perhaps the message when it arrives could have the time that it was written at. 

2. We need a system to mark messages as unread. As somebody that uses WhatsApp a lot with a lot of people throughout the day we cannot always remember to respond to everyone. The only reason I ask people to send me an email sometimes it‚Äôs so that I can mark it as unread and I can take care of responding at the most appropriate time for me.

A few recommendations

-Inbuilt todo list within the app/ reminders 
-Fast forward voice messages 
- Optimize processing while sending photos from album or screenshots - often freezes 
Notification

- notifications while on chat to be able to be silenced / put on vibrate only. 

- the send button gets hidden while a notification pops up in the middle of sending an item on a chat and gets distracting , as you tap the notification instead 

- if there would be a way to sync the app between 2 different phones / sims would be awesome for us in africa where we have to have multiple sims as the coverage isnt consistent for any one provider 

So , 2 phones same chats and same chat delivers to both phones (something like
Imap) but one account and possibly an alias

Phone keeps ringing or vibrating but no UI displayed to respond.,Though I face many issues with WhatsApp on iPhone. But this one is a major headache. I get WhatsApp call and the phone keeps ringing and vibrating. No matter the phone is locked or unlocked. WhatsApp is in foreground or background. I don‚Äôt see any UI which displays the incoming call. I can‚Äôt silence it either. And the cherry on top is I will never get to know who tried to call me cause it does not get recorded on call history as well. Earlier it was a rare case scenario but recently it has been almost a daily occurrence. Today morning it happened continuously for all my 4-5 calls. That too on a time interval.

2) Adding polls or questionnaire inside whatsapp.
Often, (esp in group convos). They ask for polls, who wants to order items, or who wants to join a club. If whatsapp have the ‚Äòon-the-go‚Äô poll system or voting system. It will manage the massive ‚Äòspams‚Äô or messages in group convo.
