The most prestigious software company in the world and they left out a basic table stakes UI feature from their second oldest product line? What kind of madness is this?\n\n**********\n\nGoogle had a wonderful email app called Inbox. They just killed it. They‚Äôve offered their original app as an alternative but it is inferior by far. It makes the gmail app feel like an email client from 2008. \n\n1) Swipe action is not customizable. Inbox you could at least snooze with a swipe. In this app I have to click on the menu button and then click snooze. \n2) Inbox would bundle categories of emails in your main inbox automatically so you could see them and delete or archive them all at once. In this app I have to go into each category and delete each email. Also Inbox was better at smartly notifying you of important emails. \n3) Inbox would recognize travel emails and bring them back for you when the day of your travel so you could quickly access your itinerary for flights and hotels. \n4) Inbox had one touch unsubscribe for newsletters and shopping that you no longer look at. \n5) Inbox had reminders that you could set making your inbox the one stop place for your workflow. \n\nInbox was a superior email app and google killed it and left us with their old, boring, less useful app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-18T04:13:49-07:00"},{"id":"7294703612","userName":"AppleUpdatesCompatibilySucks","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id547106129","version":"6.0.210322","score":3,"title":"Not bad but.. updated the app - nothing really better but it started freezing","text":"Ok, the app itself is fine - not bad at all (ie better than the stock iphone email app); \nUdated the app - nothing really better/much different (besides google annoyingly pushing its Meet more and more to try to bite off Zoom marketshare; note - thx for at least allowing to turn off that stupid footer bar with meet that just took extra space) but it started freezing (early may 2021)...

Gmail makes you switch between each one every time by selecting a tiny circle on the bottom left or three lines at the upper left. Very cumbersome.\nApple uses Settings for my email accounts, all easy to use and all the same to create. Gmail makes me go through hoops to attach the other accounts and the inbox for each account is tied to one of my google accounts, so they share inboxes and I have to decide which of my 3 gmails to use and remember for the other 3.\nApple lets me see all the folders of all my email accounts and select them by showing a third window pane on the left. Gmail doesn‚Äôt do this at all. The list that comes up is only for the current of my 3 gmails. No folders from other accounts.\nApple pops up a window for new email that fills middle third of screen with the inbox/email shown greyed out in background, a nice reminder of what I might be creating a new email for. Gmail fills the entire screen with a new email and on my large iPad Pro it is very, very annoying and jolts me so, I have to close it to remember what I was thinking.\nThis was all in the first five minutes.

The problem with Gmail‚Äôs spam filter is that you cannot predict when a email address is going to be recognized as spam.

Now all emails from 90% of the university clubs I subscribed have been in the spam folder. Yes, you can try whitelist email address, but it‚Äôs an endless task when every single legitimate email could be recognized as spam. The worst thing is that you cannot turn off gmail‚Äôs spam filter.

I keep switching between the Outlook app and Gmail app. I want to stick with Gmail, but Outlook seems to have everything I need. For example, I love that you can switch between apps in the side menu of outlook. Previously in the gmail app you could switch accounts in the side menu as well, but they were horizontally pinned at the top which was inconvenient and ugly.

It‚Äôs also not just about me using outlook but sometimes I save documents directly to my phone or the Apple cloud. Gmail does not allow me to attach none of those documents. \n\nJust when I thought I had it all, I was disappointed again.
