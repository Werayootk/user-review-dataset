In this app I have to go into each category and delete each email. Also Inbox was better at smartly notifying you of important emails. \n3) Inbox would recognize travel emails and bring them back for you when the day of your travel so you could quickly access your itinerary for flights and hotels. \n4) Inbox had one touch unsubscribe for newsletters and shopping that you no longer look at. \n5) Inbox had reminders that you could set making your inbox the one stop place for your workflow. \n\nInbox was a superior email app and google killed it and left us with their old, boring, less useful app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-18T04:13:49-07:00"},{"id":"7294703612","userName":"AppleUpdatesCompatibilySucks","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id547106129","version":"6.0.210322","score":3,"title":"Not bad but.. updated the app - nothing really better but it started freezing","text":"Ok, the app itself is fine - not bad at all (ie better than the stock iphone email app); \nUdated the app - nothing really better/much different (besides google annoyingly pushing its Meet more and more to try to bite off Zoom marketshare; note - thx for at least allowing to turn off that stupid footer bar with meet that just took extra space) but it started freezing (early may 2021)...

I use Apple email so I will compare.\nI have six email accounts (3 google, yahoo, att, Apple). Apple lets me see one integrated inbox or I can choose just one. Gmail makes you switch between each one every time by selecting a tiny circle on the bottom left or three lines at the upper left. Very cumbersome.\nApple uses Settings for my email accounts, all easy to use and all the same to create. Gmail makes me go through hoops to attach the other accounts and the inbox for each account is tied to one of my google accounts, so they share inboxes and I have to decide which of my 3 gmails to use and remember for the other 3.\nApple lets me see all the folders of all my email accounts and select them by showing a third window pane on the left. Gmail doesn’t do this at all. The list that comes up is only for the current of my 3 gmails. No folders from other accounts.\nApple pops up a window for new email that fills middle third of screen with the inbox/email shown greyed out in background, a nice reminder of what I might be creating a new email for. Gmail fills the entire screen with a new email and on my large iPad Pro it is very, very annoying and jolts me so, I have to close it to remember what I was thinking.\nThis was all in the first five minutes.

I’ve set my phone to receive notifications from this app. I was waiting for a time-sensitive email. My phone was next to me, and I never received the notification. I suddenly just stopped receiving notifications for no discernible reason! I guess Google is comfortable and no longer needs to provide products that work. Gmail, Google Meet, Chromebooks, and all other Google products are absolute garbage. I’d like my tax dollars back :) Additionally, now emails in the Promotions and Social categories never load. It says “no connection” when the connection is strong. Now the notifications on my phone just say “you have a new message” and don’t tell me who sent it or a preview of the message. That’s not a notification. It’s just that Google is garbage. And App Support does nothing so I can only leave a review that Google will never read, so their products will continue to be terrible.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-09T16:25:27-07:00"},{"id":"7892742820","userName":"RamenJD","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id827838334","version":"6.0.210919","score":2,"title":"Horrendous Spam Filter","text":"If you’re looking for important emails in your Gmail, chances are they’re in your spam folder. I use my university’s email on Gmail, just like the rest of students in my university. Over 50 legitimate emails from my university’s professors, clubs, or career center have been put in spam folder. The problem with Gmail’s spam filter is that you cannot predict when a email address is going to be recognized as spam. For example, emails from my career center had never been recognized as spam until this August. Then I missed a tons of important messages because of that. Now all emails from 90% of the university clubs I subscribed have been in the spam folder. Yes, you can try whitelist email address, but it’s an endless task when every single legitimate email could be recognized as spam. The worst thing is that you cannot turn off gmail’s spam filter. Please Gmail team, improve your spam filter AI. It’s really horrendous.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-10-08T12:32:11-07:00"},{"id":"9769564710","userName":"RACHdeannnnnn","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id178076267","version":"6.0.230305","score":4,"title":"Allow iPhone preview of JUST senders name. not email preview.

This doesn’t allow for much privacy. I would prefer to just have the option of having a Gmail notification with the senders name. The only two options you have are to just have it, tell you you have a new email, with no context at all, or it shows the body of the email in the preview. This is helpful for me during work presentations when I’m sharing my screen or just trying to maintain privacy, but also quick feasibility, when looking at my phone, and being able to see who sent me an email versus having to open the app to see who sent it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-30T17:10:40-07:00"},{"id":"4104712375","userName":"Shehaslived","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id210351742","version":"6.0.190407","score":3,"title":"Attachments only from Google Drive 👎","text":"Every time I think Gmail is getting better, I am disappointed. I keep switching between the Outlook app and Gmail app. I want to stick with Gmail, but Outlook seems to have everything I need. For example, I love that you can switch between apps in the side menu of outlook. Previously in the gmail app you could switch accounts in the side menu as well, but they were horizontally pinned at the top which was inconvenient and ugly. Now it’s where the search bar is and that’s cool. So I downloaded it back, thinking it finally had everything that I needed. \n\nNow I’m deleting it again. \n\nI’m a college student and I send a lot of attachments over email. My main cloud drive is OneDrive because it is linked with my laptop and so I can automatically sync my documents to the cloud without having to manually save it there a bunch of times. The fact that Gmail only allows attachments from the Photo library and Google Drive is so frustrating. It’s also not just about me using outlook but sometimes I save documents directly to my phone or the Apple cloud. Gmail does not allow me to attach none of those documents. \n\nJust when I thought I had it all, I was disappointed again. I really like Gmail and it has nice features, but it isn’t not practical for what I need. Unfortunately, I have to go back to Outlook.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-05-05T07:42:11-07:00"}]
