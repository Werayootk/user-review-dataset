Instead of giving me a warning and just temporarily locking my account they permanently locked my account and won‚Äôt answer any of my emails or messages on other social platforms. I had pictures of my animals on there that have passed and I‚Äôm very disappointed that I can‚Äôt get it back and I can‚Äôt even hear back from someone. To be such a big app it‚Äôs sad there‚Äôs no customer service at all to help anyone.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-14T15:13:10-07:00
