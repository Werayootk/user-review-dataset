Upon selecting ‚ÄúTell us why‚Äù I have another 2 options.  (1) I‚Äôve watched the video and (2) I don‚Äôt like the video.

I only do this for videos I have already watched.  I do not like watching videos over that I‚Äôve already watched.  So, I select option (1).   After doing this a couple hundred times or more, you would think the algorithm would go ‚ÄúOh, he doesn‚Äôt want to see videos that he‚Äôs already watched, let‚Äôs not recommend them to him anymore!‚Äù
But, no‚Ä¶sadly, the algorithm isn‚Äôt smart enough to figure that out.

So, my question to you (YouTube) is: WHAT IS THE POINT OF SUBMITTING A REASON AND THE ABILITY OF SELECTING THE OPTION OF ‚ÄúI‚ÄôVE ALREADY WATCHED THE VIDEO‚Äù REPEATEDLY IF THAT DOESN‚ÄôT STOP THE ALGORITHM FROM CONSTANTLY RECOMMENDING VIDEOS THAT I‚ÄôVE ALREADY WATCHED?
