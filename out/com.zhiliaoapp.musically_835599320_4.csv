I cannot use my wifi while on tiktok, i have to use my LTE data. I have tried everything but it simply will not work. Instead of taking down cosplayers sfx make up videos !that have trigger warnings! Down, take down the bullying accounts and sexual pages that have been up for years. I get that the app is meant for 14+ but there are still underage kids on the app that report videos for no reason, or simply because they got offended by the video that had a warning on it. Instead of taking down the video, actually veiw it, then take it down if it doesn't follow community guide lines. Don't take down a video just because a 6-9 yr. old reported it because their parents said not to watch it. They clearly got angry because their parents got on to them. I'm a cosplayer and am personally sick and tired of the youth on the app that report the lgbtq+, cosplay, gamer, etc. videos just because they did not like it. I hope that tiktok actually takes the time to read the reveiws and try to improve the app. I am very dissapointed in how this community has grown.

anyways the only problem i have with the app is some of the people on it. most of the people are completely cruel and mean to whoever they want. i know it’s not tiktoks fault or the apps fault at all, but it’s still hard watching people get hate for no reason, and for possibly being different, liking something that a lot of others don’t, having an opinion, etc. i could go on all day. 
i just wish people would think more into things before they post/comment/really just put any negativity out into the world. 
now, i get it if you’re sticking up for yourself, but stick up for YOURSELF and don’t bring someone else down in the process. stand up for you, and speak on what’s right, not start a roast battle. 
i hope the world can become a better place someday. not sure how a tiktok app review turned into a positivity lecture, but i’m all for it. i guess. and i might sound stupid putting this out into the world, but i really don’t care. goodbye, thanks for.. reading i guess?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-14T01:16:49-07:00

The community is very toxic and made me feel unwanted where I just wanted to make videos and watch them. Also some creators were very “crossing the line” per se, ie ThatVeganTeacher (I don’t know her status anymore because of all this stuff going on) harassing, bullying and even comparing not being vegan as a sin, and racism and sexism. Also some people didn’t have to work very hard for their clout, ie Charli D’amelio would just dance and get 100million followers. While other people would be making videos they put their heart and soul into and get none, my point being that it’s algorithm is pretty messed up. There’s also a lot of clickbait videos with the whole “reality shifting” scandal and other various acts that try to get people to believe them even thought it’s completely fake. TikTok didn’t live up to what I thought it would be and it was toxic and messed up with people trying to get views but faking stuff. There have also been people pretending to be vampires and quite frankly i find that a bit weird. I understand that tiktok is a place to express yourself but some people make it unenjoyable with content like “dancing” or just stealing content. Honestly i didn’t understand the hype around this app. it feels like a toxic place, and most of the content is stolen or just repetitive. 1/5 stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-01T13:30:59-07:00

Self harming, serious threats being made, harassment (extremely common), dangerous advice, slander and libel, the list goes on and on...and so many of them get reported multiple times but somehow don’t violate community standards???

To stop Doctor Robotnik from using Chaos Emerald shards to fortify his base, the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidnathrough 15 levels. As a Sonic the Hedgehogseries platformer, the characters run and jump to reach the end of a level while defeating enemy robots and collecting rings. In separate bonus stages, the player must run forward and collect rings to earn one of the Chaos Emerald shards. The game was developed by Aspect Co. and published by Sega for the Game Gear. It was the final Sonic the Hedgehog game for the system, and has been rereleased on the Master System (1997), through three Sonic-themed compilations (2003, 2004, and 2023), and the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console (2012). Despite their similar titles and coinciding releases, Sonic Blast and Sonic 3D Blast have little in common. Retrospective reviewers generally had little praise for Sonic Blast and have deemed it one of the series' worst games. Although some considered its graphics impressive when considering the technological restrictions of the Game Gear, most found its animations and colors mediocre.

For instance: you would like to show a friend something funny that you watched in a Tik Tok, ...unfortunately it was at the end of the video. So now you have to wait to show them the absolute comedy gold. At first that doesn’t seem so bad does it. Although  something to take in to consideration is that not everybody has time to watch all of a video just to get to the good part. That’s where my idea comes into play. I think that TikTok  should make a feature that includes fast forwarding and reversing the video to the exact point you want it at. 
   Otherwise I love this app. It is a way to be yourself and be creative in your own way. If you don’t want to do that, it’s also a good to pass time or just have a few laughs. Better yet it’s a way to find common ground with other people who like similar stuff that you do.

However, was pleasantly surprised by how easy and fun it is to use and the level of diversity.  I found myself laughing and feeling inspired and motivated with TT.  It renewed my desire to engage because TT is a whole “come as you are vibe” no need to put on airs or try to fit into any kind of mold to get views and likes.  

Additionally, I abandoned social media for years because of the negativity and horrible vibrations I could feel through my phone \ computer.  With TT I don’t feel that vibe and am learning a lot of great information, seeing fascinating art and designs, talented and hilarious people and I also see others collaborating and connecting with one another.  

All in all TT is one of best social media platforms to choose if you are just starting out and wanting to build a following for personal or business reasons.  It makes you feel like you are a part of something, instead of feeling like you have to remain in the fringes.  Support and engagement is easy and encouraged and won’t make you feel super exposed and vunerable.

I know you probably won’t read this review, but there are many kids whose parents (like mine) would be totally fine with people I don’t follow commenting on my videos. Kids can be smart too. If they are bullied, they can tell their parents! It should not be the app’s decision to block things when the parents can always connect to the account and do that themselves! Just make it clear that you are not liable for a parent’s or child’s decisions on your app. Especially on something like privacy settings.

This makes it harder for you to feel safe in your own home because tiktok is always watching you. And even before you make a video tiktok takes the video and scans your face and they find out who you are and takes that into a data base to secretly watch you which is the creepiest thing I heard all of my life time.

To date I’ve lost about 4K followers. I contacted TikTok, they told me delete your cache, update the app, switch from using WiFI, but these don’t work. I post faith content and talks about the mind. Other faith creators aren’t losing followers. I thought it was the niche. They then told me it’s because of inauthentic followers which I don’t believe because then we would all be affected. I think this is another glitch of the the system like their many other glitches. I saw a faith creator who had about 1.6 million followers. TikTok deleted her account because she is underage. She’s actually in her late 30’s. She had to start over. Many people have experienced this. I have been to a live once where this guy (he has about 5 million followers) exposed their private parts. I reported the live and nothing happened. I wouldn’t have children on the app.

So TikTok has done much for me because it’s given me a platform that o post my content, but when you work hard and see follower’s dropping - what is that?

It’s definitely gone a long way from making dancing videos. For the most part I’ve enjoyed the app letting you socialize with different people and find a community where you belong but, it recently came to my attention that there are many cp profile accounts on the app. I knew there would be creeps as there are on any social media platform. Though it seems that there is this giant amount of accounts either called posting in private or some variation of that. On those accounts CHILDREN will post videos of themselves naked and/or doing inappropriate things to themselves on said videos. It is sickening knowing that, that is happening and has been happening for a while on this app. Someone had posted one of those videos on the account to Public which made its way to some peoples for you page. They reported it and it came back saying that nothing wrong was found on the video. A video of a child NAKED. Also reporting those accounts will come back as them not finding anything wrong. Tiktok has continuously been turning a blind eye to this incredibly disgusting ring of adults grooming children to post things that they don’t know will hurt them in the future.

Common “reasons” are adult or minor nudity when the creator was covered completely in all of their videos. Often the video that was wrongly taken down was months old, I’ve heard of people appealing it, getting the video back, but getting post banned anyway. It happens repeatedly until it’s to the point where you’d be better off just making a new account because you’re always post banned. It doesn’t help that it’s incredibly hard to get TikTok’s attention to get these issues fixed, even when you email them it’s obvious that you’re talking to a computer that doesn’t understand what you’re asking. This doesn’t even cover half of everything starting to go wrong with this app, just what I think is the biggest thing. Many creators have already left TikTok due to mainly this issue (shadowban is also a big contributor to people quitting) and many more continue to leave as this app proceeds to ignore these issues.

For example the reporting system was designed to report children and not adults, I’ve seen adults get banned for minor safety. Personally I don’t get that since their not minors. Then there’s the new restrictions with minors, minors no longer can duet, comment, or stitch other  posts, meaning that if there was a Tiktoker that was a minor they no longer can show appreciation. Tiktok forced minors to go private for our “safety”, Tiktok if you cared for our safety you would’ve banned the adults that were showing off their private parts, let me say that again adults showing their privates. Adults also turned the app 18+ this app was designed for kids. Not adults, I’m not saying if your an adult you can’t have the app, but please remember there are children on the app. I’ve seen four year olds on there, please be mindful of this.

I personally use TikTok to have something to do and talk about to my friends. It’s basically all we do, sometimes it gets out of control and we start making TikToks in the gym of our school during lunch when we can get suspended, but, you gotta do what you gotta do for TikTok. Usually people are really nice and supportive but people can get out of hand with shaming people as a joke when it’s really not funny at all, I’ve even caught myself hating it just comes and goes and I try to stay away from it. TikTok is my most used app and I have 30+ hours on it every week and idek how. There are a few things I would change and it would be that you can have more control who views your videos. I still want my friends and the public to be able to see my videos but also I want to be able to block a specific person from just one video instead of blocking them from my Paige. That would make you feel a lot more comfortable with posting because I’m not the most popular kid in my school and there are kids out there just trying to put you down for fun.

It is a great place for me to cosplay, the community is friendly and supportive, and I can do more than take photos now when I’m in cosplay.  However, the past month and a half every time I try to post my videos go immediately “under review” and some stay that way. My videos don’t go against any guidelines. I even had videos taken down, and I would message asking why it was taken down, but no response. I would rewatch my taken down videos confused how it goes against community guidelines. Especially because I see similar content on my For You Page.  I recommend not harping people like this. Because it’s frustrating to me that I put hours into making TikToks only for them to never be seen because they are kept “under review”.
I recommend not putting peoples videos “under review” until someone reports the video for going against guidelines. And send a reason why, that way it will be clearer on why the video was taken down and what the creator can avoid doing in their next TikTok video.
I love TikTok and I want to keep using it, but if the server is still going to keep me from posting then I might leave.

Ive made a lot of videos on my account, and Im always making videos that are fun to watch, but go along with the guidlines. However I think the report and appeal system is very bad. I recently made a video that was actually me doing a trend that is on tiktok for halloween. It's a trend where you pore candle wax in water, and it will create the first letter of the person youre gonna marry. I tell you this because its a silly harmless tiktok that everyone is doing. About 3 minutes of me posting the video, someone reported it, and it was immediatly taken down without question. I was given the option to appeal which I did because the video I made didnt go against any guidlines (which I made sure to read to see if I actually did something) about 3 more minutes go by, and I'm told the same message except now it says that my appeal was denied. I understand we need this stuff for actual offensive and dangerous content, but I feel the reporter has too much power which leaves the appealer to have almost no say in the matter whether their video was offensive or not.

Though I have some concerns that should be brought up. For starters, I am personally dissatisfied about having to wait an hour without liking anyone’s videos, It would be nice to like people’s videos without running into a problem. Another concern is not having enough fans to go “live”.  
I had hopes to go live a few weeks after I started my account but I haven’t had any progression. Honestly, I think you would need just 100 followers to go live on the app. I also don’t like how TikTok puts all famous people on my “For you” page, I would like to give chances to smaller accounts, such as account with at least 30 followers. It would also be nice if there were less ads. When I first open TikTok on my phone, I see an ad about a trend or another app. I’m also scrolling through the For you page and see some random ad that doesn’t need to be on TikTok, although I know some ads promote movies. Another concern I have brought to attention is the use of cuss words. Cuss words have been found in almost all of the videos I watch. I am disappointed in the sound, and it gets to my head. Other than those concerns, I am proud to be apart of the TikTok community!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-19T20:37:22-07:00

They mean the world to me and it is so sad that I can’t just talk to them and interact! Sadly, I have to have 1,000 followers which in my opinion is a little bit hard to get! I know that TikTok headquarters is really trying to improve this app and I think it is going great and you all fix all the bugs! I just think it is a little unfair that only the people with lots of followers get to go live and none of the people with a average amount get too. If you don’t want to drop the follower amount that is fine☺️! I just want to share my opinion! Another concern I have is the reporting! Half of my videos have been taken down because they are “violating community guidelines” but I strongly disagree, a video of me singing go t taken down! I really put effort into it! It made me really sad! It makes no sense because half naked girls are on there doing who knows what while I’m over here singing but their videos stay up for the world to see please fix this!

The music is fun, and all in all it is supposed to be a FUN app. However, the app has become littered with 9 year olds that report every video and/or view content that they shouldn’t and that to me is just not okay. The people who work on TikTok seriously need to work more on how they monitor the app. A feature to make your profile only accessible to those 13 and older would be great ( its not like the app started out as a 13+ app or anything, no way, that’s not why there are 7 year olds using it now 🤦🏻‍♀️ ). That way, if a cosplayer wants to make a post with, say, SFX makeup that looks gory someone isn’t gonna come around and report it for no reason, because the profile is 13+. I dunno this feature and a lot of other features could be added to make the app better. Cyber bullying on tiktok is worse than ever right now, and I just hope that the app becomes a safe place to have fun again like it used to be. If you like music, messing with transitions, making new friends rather easily, etc. ...

They pretend they protect the kids on this app but really they just exploit them and silences any creators that are just trying to educate the youth or who are literally just trying to protect them from ACTUAL GROOMERS ON THIS APP.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-21T11:58:03-07:00

I hate going to people’s comment sections to see all the hate and negativity there is.I absolutely hate going to comment sections and seeing all the body shaming from “You’ve gained weight” to “I can see your ribs” it’s like you can’t post a video of you eating something that “isn’t healthy” or wearing bathing suits without getting body shamed. I hate seeing people turn off their comments because of it, I hate seeing people stop posting because of the hate and I personally think it has got to stop because people start thinking that just because someone started spreading hate that they can do it and it just gradually becomes worse. If I wanted to I could list at least 7-8 people getting hated on or body shamed which I think is 7-8 too many!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-15T02:30:39-07:00

I love seeing everyone come together just to have fun no matter what state you’re in. The only downside I see is muting black and non white creators. I wish the community guidelines applied to everyone across the board. I have seen a lot of white creators steal peoples creations and pass them as their own. Also seen racist comments, videos and sexual assault towards children being reported and being told they didn’t violate any community guidelines you can block that person. Why is this ok when I seen someone threatening to kill a black baby and none of the videos are taken down for not violating community guidelines? Community guidelines should apply to everyone and not sensor those who report those things that are in violation. You have child predators on this app who are openly saying to children I want to sleep with you why are they still on tiktok even a big creator is seen sexual assaulting a girl and it was being reported and he is still a big creator still doing the same thing to young girls. But overall the app is fun I just wish it was equal across the board.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-09T16:32:24-07:00

I have learned about different cultures and their people in ways I would have never been able to from my small part of North Carolina. You really feel like part of their families and become protective of the person brave enough to push that button and let the world into their lives! I most certainly can not thank TikTok enough for giving musicians a new way to grow, and create the attention they deserve! We the viewers have the power to change a person with a dream’s life and making us the labels eyes and ears for the first time, in a longtime. It’s allowed us to create a network of artists who can take an idea from Bedroom to Broadway, from recording at your friends house (Hey Travis) to millions of strangers listening to it on SirusXM/Radio and beyond! Heck I’ve been on Dr. Phil and Inside Edition because of it and am now writing with amazing musicians like Ben Miller all because of TikTok and as my career grows, so will my love for this platform and it’s importance to so many people like me.

9759270199,.Oliviaa.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1347921671,28.4.1,5,I love this app,"TikTok is an amazing app that enables everyone to express themselves. It’s not only a great place to go when you seek entertainment, but it’s also a safe place to let your creativity run free. I’ve heard that TikTok may soon be banned, and I’m not sure how true this may be, but I really wanted to leave this message to show to whomever reads this that this app is changing lives. To explain further, TikTok isn’t just a playful app, it’s a job. For some, it’s their only job, the only way they get to eat 3 meals a day. Without this app, think about the amount of people that will be unemployed. Think about the number of people will lose their safe space, and the number of people who will lose their entertainment, their excitement. Also, TikTok is FULL of paid promotions, think about how many people working for different companies will decrease in sales, which in turn, decreases TikTok’s company sales as a result. I know I am just one person, and I am not even a spec on the Birds Eye view of the world, but I believe my voice can make a difference, as I am not ready to see my favorite app be no more. Thank you for seeing my perspective, Olivia",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-27T17:52:58-07:00

8890895870,Gwendolyn545,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1114500961,25.2.0,4,My Thoughts on TikTok,"Well I am a 13 year old and my parents let me try out TikTok. At first, they were concerned about what’s on TikTok, but after me having it a few days, and of course, sending them a couple funny animal TikTok’s, they even got it themselves! There is a lot of diversity, and you can learn a lot from it. There is some inappropriate things on there but what I do, is I either scroll past the video or I press the button that says don’t show anything like this to me again. And, once I did that, it worked! Most of my friends have this app and I found some other students from my school and old school on it and connected with them! It’s really fun to make some new friends and connect with old ones. Some cool things I also found out is some hacks with math and that really helped me on my homework! I also found out how to become more organized and know where all of my stuff is! While it can be addictive, there are some posts that remind you that you may be scrolling for too long! But those are upon occasion. What I do, is before I sit down to watch TikTok I set a 15 minute reminder that I have to get up and do some things! I would really recommend this app for 12-16 year olds.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-19T12:39:04-07:00

There’s funny videos, tutorials, art, cosplay, lip syncing, editing, and so much more! Tik Tok is prettty much like all the other social media platforms but BETTER! However it isn’t perfect and I have a few suggestions. First of all I think that the rules on the community guidelines need to chill! After working hard by making videos to go live, I got permanently banned from going live! Also, while I’m on the topic about going live, I think that you should be able to go live no matter the amount of followers you have! It’s really hard to hit 1k and most creators can’t! Another suggestion I have is that there should be a dislike button on videos for 2 reasons, one being that if someone is talking about a political topic that we don’t agree about, I think we should be able to express that! And the second reason is so that creators will know what there followers do or don’t like to watch! Overall TikTok is definitely still really cool and I’m literally on it 24/7 lol! U hope that these suggestions are taken into consideration because I have seen comments on my videos saying these things! But if your wondering if you should download TikTok then it’s a definite YES!

7132101057,Addam Posey,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id730671927,18.7.5,1,Funny and addicting but there are several issues,"So I’m just gonna get straight to the point. TikTok is unable maintain a consistent enforcement of its community guidelines since they will refuse to take down videos that are in clear violation of community guidelines (for example acts of violence against people and animals, derogatory speech, sexual exploit, etc) or when they do try to ‘enforce’ guidelines, the app takes down videos that do not violate them but are falsely reported by a mass of trolls or go against the app’s ‘agenda’. For the latter case, TikTok does not make an effort to work with creators who have been falsely accused and will shows little regard to have the video restored in most situations. It is quite intolerable that the app allows people to exploit its community guidelines just to harass or silence creators. Also, important social issues/injustices that people try to use their platform to call attention to have been silenced by TikTok through either limiting video’s showing in its algorithm or outright taking down the video with little explanation. Overall, I hope that TikTok is able to do something about this issue soon because for an app that is directed towards all ages, it not only puts people at risk, but displays a cruel injustice that can be simply resolved if the administrators of this app showed any sense of appreciation, decency, and care to the users and creators that make their app popular enough to yield a living and paycheck.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-22T09:06:29-07:00
