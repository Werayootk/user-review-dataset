Where Arrive really comes up short is keeping up with delivery status. Arrive shows that a package is arriving today, but is still 160 miles away near Dallas.

Obviously this doesn’t affect the overall effectiveness of the app, but I’m anal, and I want that erroneous record to be removed. Can you please add an option to delete records?

Another idea I had was to include a feature to “hide” certain packages.  Sometimes my wife or kids may use my phone, so it would be nice if I could hide details for packages that are presents.

If we were too dumb to get to those vendors in the first place, how did I get there before you knew I placed an order, that your app is supposed to track? 

Enough with the main screen interface of showing me all your partners, while it may be a ‘nice’ feature, it’s discouraging me from using your app more often. 

I want to be able to track my orders and get updates in real time in one app, instead of using apps from the main delivery services. 

The main reason I have decided to write this review is due to the fact your search feature, once located in the ‘Order’ tab, and used to search my orders, now searches the ‘Vendors’ and ‘Offers’ you want to push on me.

I now have to dig for anything useful past all the useless advertising where all the good info used to be right up front. Plus for some reason I've stopped getting delivery notifications despite nothing changing in my settings which was half the purpose of the app in the first place. I probably won't get rid of the app since it does have useful data if you work for it, but I'm definitely not opening it unless I have to.

I have even reached out to the vendor of the products and they too have never replied. I have asked various times for a refund as my money was taken out of my account immediately but I have not received anything. Also, I’ve recently found that the vendor “Bad Bunny Apparel” is most likely no longer in service because every time since that I’ve tried contacting them it shows up in the shop app that it’s non existent.

It just gave me anxiety about my package and caused trouble for the people I had to ask about my package- due to the poor upkeep of this app. I don’t recommend any website or company using this app. I think they should try something else.

You can also tap the app to confirm the item has been delivered to your address.
