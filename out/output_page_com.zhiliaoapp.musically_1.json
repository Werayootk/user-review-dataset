Please do not ruin the experience by tightening the requirements so much the platform becomes useless. Also please consider blocking posts that do not meet guidelines when user tries to post, tell people and give them a chance to change. Many times people do not mean to break the rules and would change their mind if given the chance. It is better to do it this way that let people post, and then remove content after more people repost the same material and everyone gets strikes and eventually lose the community they worked so hard to build up.

The automatic refresh happens to me all the time where the fyp will refresh without me swiping down and I also just think this feature is annoying altogether. I don‚Äôt understand the point of it. It would be nice if they just had a refresh button that you press rather then having it be a swipe thing because I can‚Äôt tell you how many times it‚Äôs refreshed by itself or on accident when I didn‚Äôt want it to and I‚Äôm never able to find the video I was watching ever again. 2. There‚Äôs so many hate comments on every single video just about and I know tiktok can‚Äôt really do a whole lot about this and it‚Äôs not their fault. However, if you guys had a better moderating system where you monitor the comments on people‚Äôs videos and delete awful comments I feel like that would be useful. Because not everyone wants to go through their comments deleting all the nasty ones and they still have to read them and it‚Äôs just very frustrating to deal with. Other then that, tiktok is an amazing platform and I wish it wasn‚Äôt so toxic from all the horrible hate comments and people who are trolling as well as those bot accounts that are always trying to scam you.

I have had to take multiple breaks off this app which drove me to making this review, I believe the developer should fix these problems.

It is clear that I think this app is terrific, but I don‚Äôt think the age rating should be 12+ , I would recommend for the app to be 17+ since adults can accept or fulfill the expectations of viewers, but minors may become more affected to the type of ‚Äúfans‚Äù on this platform. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a regular person who complains but I have to say, people should be more careful with what they post, instagram and Snapchat along with twitter are probably completely safer.

It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‚Äòside‚Äô of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-21T16:34:58-07:00"},{"id":"9748679234","userName":"Awesome sauce 465","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id428058386","version":"28.4.1","score":5,"title":"Thank you","text":"I‚Äôm a U.S. citizen.

First of all, the app is addicting. I‚Äôve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could‚Äôve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it‚Äôs partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads ‚Äúopen‚Äù instead of ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. I‚Äôm very frustrated when I can‚Äôt participate in trends because I‚Äôm still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn‚Äôt perfect but if there‚Äôs an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn‚Äôt the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can‚Äôt stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would‚Äôve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-25T16:27:07-07:00"},{"id":"8274237083","userName":"Taylor's Playlist","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31206958","version":"22.8.2","score":3,"title":"Oh no.

I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It‚Äôs unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I‚Äôve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for ‚Äúviolence‚Äù even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It‚Äôs as if they didn‚Äôt read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you‚Äôre actually reading this, PLEASE fix this.

However, I have some complaints. Firstly, I did not allow access to my contacts and it still very clearly uses them. It may be in the terms and conditions, but I find that very violating. Secondly, reports. The TikTok moderators never take into account the context of a comment when you report it. And often times, I will report something for very clearly violating something, and nothing happens. I have also had comments removed before, yet brought right back because they were wrong to remove it. The TikTok moderators do not do their job properly. Too many people get stuff removed for no reason, and too many people don‚Äôt get stuff removed when it should be. There needs to be an option to actually type a message when you appeal to plead your case. And there also needs to be a way to appeal a report when it doesn‚Äôt go through, because clearly someone doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing. I have seen someone get banned simply for existing, and yet I report a video for literally having M-rated content with blood and guts, and yet it has ‚Äúno violations‚Äù. Same thing with harming animals. Or just harmful content that is meant to bring others down. This app either needs to remove reporting, or do their job.

I‚Äôm disabled and can‚Äôt move around easily. I also can‚Äôt drive. As a result, I can‚Äôt get out and meet people. TikTok allows me to meet and communicate with those that share my interests. I like to crochet and there are numerous groups, at all times of the day and night, that I can spend time with. I also am able to explore the cosmos thanks to streamers like Professor Nyx and See The Skies, who share what they see through their telescopes. Professor Nyx is a real professor and is a wealth of knowledge that he loves to share. Because of my disability and fixed income, I‚Äôll never be able to afford to go to Disney World or Disneyland. However, thanks to the generosity of various streamers, I can vicariously experience both parks with them. I also get a good laugh every day thanks to posters that share the funny moments with their pets and families with the rest of us. For instance, this past summer, we had the great chicken wars. There are also several places that rescue donkeys that share their funny exploits and loving moments.

The algorithm is pushing your content to people that don‚Äôt care to see what you post. They want us to use hashtags, and many have millions of views, but we only get a couple hundred at best? They‚Äôre purposely hold you back unless you pay yo promote your videos. I would if I was promoting product, for marketing reasons. It‚Äôs turning into a shopping app, rather than what it started out as. The algorithm based off your likes and content you want to see also gets stagnant. You will see the same things over and over, like one video, they shove a creator in your face a few more times within 10 videos.. it‚Äôs just odd. You can‚Äôt quite discover new or be discovered like you use to. I also love the hypocrisy of their ‚Äúcommunity guidelines‚Äù.. if you tell someone to go F themselves, because they‚Äôre bullying you and saying mean things. Hurtful things. It doesn‚Äôt matter.

They repost BAD mental health videos and just knowing your friends are going through something similar, putting on a smile when they‚Äôre really\nnot okay. And getting exposed to that kind of content ruins your own mental health. Also seeing depressing videos make others people relate and get sucked into this whole other world where they thing their ugly, everyone hates them, their not good enough, basically no self love whatsoever. I personally have learned about new things that have harmed myself. For example eating disorders, I have a eating disorder now because of tiktok/social media because they make you belive you have to be skinny, have an hourglass body, have clear skin, smooth skin, pretty hair, EVERYTHING. I also would like to say I learned about sh which is self harm and now I have it because once you get exposed to it you tend to get sucked into wanting to do it, then a few seconds later boom I have a bunch of red marks in my arms, would buy clothes to fit in even when I hated wearing them.

The good thing about Roblox is that it is very fun , and u can have a blast on this app. I really like Roblox but not the issues.

If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-11T00:40:28-07:00"},{"id":"8133598620","userName":"enhpad13","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1314954553","version":"22.1.0","score":3,"title":"The app is astounding, but...","text":"I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps.

There are some videos that aren‚Äôt appropriate for kids under the age of 11, but in order to fix this, you can restrict time limits and what videos they can see. If your kid is super addicted to tiktok, or is on the app 24/7, deleting the app or account is not the solution. This has happened to me once, on accident. I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don‚Äôt delete their accounts or apps. Don‚Äôt go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don‚Äôt scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things.

It has become a popular platform for car enthusiasts to showcase their cars and share their passion for all things automotive. However, TikTok can be both great and bad for the car community for several reasons. On the positive side, TikTok provides a platform for car enthusiasts to connect and share their love for cars. It allows them to showcase their cars, share tips and tricks, and learn from other enthusiasts. It also allows them to connect with a larger audience and gain exposure for their content. On the negative side, TikTok can also be a breeding ground for misinformation, dangerous stunts, and reckless driving. Some users may post videos of themselves driving recklessly or performing dangerous stunts, which can give the car community a bad reputation. Additionally, some users may spread false information about cars or car maintenance, which can be harmful to both cars and their owners. Overall, TikTok can be a great tool for connecting with other car enthusiasts and sharing your love for cars. However, it's important to use the platform responsibly and avoid dangerous stunts or spreading false information.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-14T19:37:18-07:00"},{"id":"9122711135","userName":"shaggy and scobby","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1162634042","version":"26.2.0","score":2,"title":"Disgusting","text":"Tiktok Is disgusting they are allowing children to be exploited by their family. They are allowing a child to be groomed by the internet. And though they have nothing to do with it. They need to ban the accounts with children in them period. These children have no idea what their families are truly doing to them. As in the wren Eleanor situation, she has no idea what her mother is putting online. Shes just 3 years old and is having fun being filmed. She has no idea there are creeps on the internet saving her videos and doing who knows what with them. Just as the other kids on tiktok and instagram and really any kind of social media app, have no idea what the comments mean. There are ppl saying they are gonna kidnap a child. They are literally grooming children, and tiktok is allowing it. They love to ban just dancing videos (ones of adults), but when it comes to a child getting groomed by predators on the internet they are no where to be found?! It‚Äôs honestly disgusting these accounts are still up. And for any mother or father who runs across this, please i am begging you take your children off social media. Their lives need to be private until they are old enough to even understand what the concept of internet means, meaning a 6 year old is NOT old enough for the internet, any kid under 13 just shouldn't be on the internet.

It seems that you were guilty until proven innocent and they really don‚Äôt respond to you whenever you submit anything to support and asked to know why or what happened so you know what it was.

There needs to be a better process and I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair. I do think that TikTok is an excellent platform but they really need to work on customer service and personal interaction. I do agree with one review that I saw on here, where they said that they believe that if they don‚Äôt like you for whatever reason whether it is personal parents or whether you‚Äôre able to entertain the executives; or whether you‚Äôre able to bring in money, then this happens quite often until you are completely banned forever.

With plenty of opportunities to go down any rabbit hole you  receive well paced breaks from related content and even have moments when the app, get this, suggests you take a break and come back later. What started as an app teaching an entire generation how to express themselves in dance has turned into self help, political activism, crowd funding, mental health care, and an amazing fluid way to transfer ideas and of course the most amazing pet and animal videos that will take you on a well regulated entertainment journey. Thank you for your contributions to supporting the LGBTQIA and minority  communities via your app and for promoting a more worldly perspective.

And so I reposted the video. It got taken down again. I can‚Äôt post till tomorrow. I plan on reposting it. If it gets taken down again I‚Äôll repost it again. I‚Äôm not going to take down my art because ‚ÄúTikTok says shoulders are not allowed‚Äù this isn‚Äôt elementary. So stop. I still enjoy TikTok but this is getting annoying. I hope TikTok can fix their community guidelines.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-04-03T16:34:38-07:00"}]
