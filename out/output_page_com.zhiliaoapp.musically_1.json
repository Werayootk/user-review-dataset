I think tik tik took the time to see how we as human beings who are all different try getting certain things out online secretly or wide open bc it is easy when we are behind a screen and as expected responses piled in and this became a true safe haven for anyone and it helped me see that I am not alone and we can no matter how hard things may get someone has shared success so a lot of emptiness fear and don’t became HOPE  and now and this is a feeling  but also my own knowledge that I have a perfect strangers attention support and guidance as to how they do things.

I am not advocation for allowing clear hate speech or any hate speech. I am just making sure that you allow us to share pictures and videos of injured people and also violence against innocent so that all humans around the world can see what is going on and judge for themselves. Even instagram is allowing this, but I don’t like that platform yours is more personable and allows for good discussions. Please do not ruin the experience by tightening the requirements so much the platform becomes useless. Also please consider blocking posts that do not meet guidelines when user tries to post, tell people and give them a chance to change. Many times people do not mean to break the rules and would change their mind if given the chance. It is better to do it this way that let people post, and then remove content after more people repost the same material and everyone gets strikes and eventually lose the community they worked so hard to build up. It is bad for you and for us. Thank you so much for your platform. We know you are under a lot of scrutiny and pressure to block.

I was on a live watching this girl do some nails on a other girl but then I said the nails were thick and that my dog has nails long but I was exaggerating and I did tell them that. Now I didn’t know what I was saying was harmful but then this girl said get out of here and called me young and the creator of the live said or did nothing. Then everyone in the live I mean EVERYONE was attacking me and saying I was young and saying to leave and get out and still the creator did nothing but do the same as them I got blocked and I wasn’t able comment sorry. No I’m not proud of the way I acted but what im extremely mad about is that I got blocked but people were saying mean stuff that violated the community guidelines and they didn’t get blocked or nothing but I did I find this completely wrong I reported them on TikTok and now I’m sending a review of my experience that came from TikTok. Please if you can do something make the creators apologize including me and I will do better if you would like account names I will for sure do that I don’t have evidence I’m hoping you guys could see what happened on that live.

And once you send an appeal it is already to late and nobody has responded to your appeal and ur account that u have worked hard for is gone , I just feel that TikTok only worries about the more popular side of there app more than the normal people who get there accounts deleted for doing nothing but just being themselves and doing what they like and then getting there accounts felted because some child decided to ruin what that person has built for themselves by just writing a small sentence and saying that they are underaged I just think that someone should monitor the account before making the decision of deleting it , There is also Aton of other issues like filters not being open to some people in certain places and TikTok being weird with updates and more.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-04T22:19:39-07:00"},{"id":"10385617841","userName":"snowflakequeen14","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id881116902","version":"31.1.0","score":4,"title":"Please Improve Moderating Systems","text":"I love tiktok very much but there’s a couple things that would make it more enjoyable and less stressful to use. 1. The automatic refresh happens to me all the time where the fyp will refresh without me swiping down and I also just think this feature is annoying altogether. I don’t understand the point of it. It would be nice if they just had a refresh button that you press rather then having it be a swipe thing because I can’t tell you how many times it’s refreshed by itself or on accident when I didn’t want it to and I’m never able to find the video I was watching ever again. 2. There’s so many hate comments on every single video just about and I know tiktok can’t really do a whole lot about this and it’s not their fault. However, if you guys had a better moderating system where you monitor the comments on people’s videos and delete awful comments I feel like that would be useful. Because not everyone wants to go through their comments deleting all the nasty ones and they still have to read them and it’s just very frustrating to deal with. Other then that, tiktok is an amazing platform and I wish it wasn’t so toxic from all the horrible hate comments and people who are trolling as well as those bot accounts that are always trying to scam you. Ultimately, tiktok needs to do a better job of moderating their app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-19T12:26:11-07:00"},{"id":"10478998724","userName":"fxkvdyo ctikbtk.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1218532547","version":"31.5.0","score":3,"title":"Well..","text":"I love TikTok as much as everyone else does, but I’m getting concerned with the shorts people are posting on this app. I have seen lives of very inappropriate things, disgusting videos, and worst of all, hate. This isn’t my only concern, I don’t want to come off as I don’t like this app, since this isn’t a complaint. I have had to take multiple breaks off this app which drove me to making this review, I believe the developer should fix these problems. If I hadn’t downloaded this app none of these memories wouldn’t have been made. Even with the disturbing, and funny videos on this platform, I want to wish the developers or developer— a happy life, along with all the creators with their funny and relatable videos!!\n\nAlso, now that I have been on this app long enough to realize the requirements of this judgmental society. It is clear that I think this app is terrific, but I don’t think the age rating should be 12+ , I would recommend for the app to be 17+ since adults can accept or fulfill the expectations of viewers, but minors may become more affected to the type of “fans” on this platform. I wouldn’t want to be a regular person who complains but I have to say, people should be more careful with what they post, instagram and Snapchat along with twitter are probably completely safer. I’m just giving an opinion to rise the rating, so parents could be more strict and not allow their child to be watching vulgarity or inappropriate content.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-10-15T13:54:52-07:00"},{"id":"7491237071","userName":"Zanna .","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id26959750","version":"19.9.0","score":3,"title":"Social Work student here!","text":"For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‘side’ of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-21T16:34:58-07:00"},{"id":"9748679234","userName":"Awesome sauce 465","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id428058386","version":"28.4.1","score":5,"title":"Thank you","text":"I’m a U.S. citizen.

I think that’s why most horrible laws have been passed statewide because it would rarely hit news in other areas of the country. My feeling with the history of how extremist tend to try to win is to eliminate communication within our country from one citizen to the other from state to state. That’s why they are going after you guys literally biggest and best communication app for speed of process but if they win they’ll be able to go after all.

First of all, the app is addicting. I’ve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could’ve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it’s partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads “open” instead of “update”. I’m very frustrated when I can’t participate in trends because I’m still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn’t perfect but if there’s an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn’t the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can’t stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would’ve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-25T16:27:07-07:00"},{"id":"8274237083","userName":"Taylor's Playlist","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31206958","version":"22.8.2","score":3,"title":"Oh no.

I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It’s unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I’ve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for “violence” even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It’s as if they didn’t read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you’re actually reading this, PLEASE fix this.

I love that you can just scroll and take your mind off stuff. And it stays up to date. And one of my favorite parts is that you can scroll past ads. It’s not just some trap for money. However, I have some complaints. Firstly, I did not allow access to my contacts and it still very clearly uses them. It may be in the terms and conditions, but I find that very violating. Secondly, reports. The TikTok moderators never take into account the context of a comment when you report it. And often times, I will report something for very clearly violating something, and nothing happens. I have also had comments removed before, yet brought right back because they were wrong to remove it. The TikTok moderators do not do their job properly. Too many people get stuff removed for no reason, and too many people don’t get stuff removed when it should be. There needs to be an option to actually type a message when you appeal to plead your case. And there also needs to be a way to appeal a report when it doesn’t go through, because clearly someone doesn’t know what they are doing. I have seen someone get banned simply for existing, and yet I report a video for literally having M-rated content with blood and guts, and yet it has “no violations”. Same thing with harming animals. Or just harmful content that is meant to bring others down. This app either needs to remove reporting, or do their job.

Usually and typically find the breaking stories several hours before the mainstream media and often times the news that they don’t or simply won’t report. I can’t think of any drawbacks to the contrary only that before posting a comment I learned that I have to chose my words strategically and methodically first, that there are consequences.\n\nThe wording and phrasing of a post is just as important symbolic of reality because it as if you are in front of a live audience and in fact are.

But, it will never create a comment section for you. So, there will never ever be a comment section where everyone is nice to each other. You will experience hatred, hate speech, online cyber bullying, and more. I ask whoever is reading this because they’re scrolling for fun or they want to actually know what it is like to have the app. There is hatred, and it is social media. Every social media is full of it and might effect you in a way you won’t even realize. Tiktok is an amazing app, because it requires age restrictions to keep children safe, it requires a lot of safety so kids don’t get hurt. But, if you’re a mother looking at reviews to see if it’s safe for you child, then do not let them get it. Because you shouldn’t have to look through a review to see if a SOCIAL MEDIA app is good for them, because it is not. There are also videos on here that don’t belong on here.

TikTok does have a feature for you to say you are uninterested in the LIVES however that only last 10 minutes before the same exact LIVE is again being shown to me. Every time minutes I’m being bombarded with useless items trying to be sold to me. TikTok is so consumed with suppressing real world events and silencing creators from rightfully using their platform and voices to create change and spread knowledge to those who don’t know and could help that they’ve let this once great platform full of useful information, life changing/saving hacks and a good time in to an app that wants to do nothing but silence the youth of today and “keep us in our places” so that the status quo may be upheld while we the people of the world continue to to suffer.

But that’s the way the developers want it, and I’ll explain. You post a video, you will get a couple hundred views, and about a guaranteed 10% likes. The algorithm is pushing your content to people that don’t care to see what you post. They want us to use hashtags, and many have millions of views, but we only get a couple hundred at best? They’re purposely hold you back unless you pay yo promote your videos. I would if I was promoting product, for marketing reasons. It’s turning into a shopping app, rather than what it started out as. The algorithm based off your likes and content you want to see also gets stagnant. You will see the same things over and over, like one video, they shove a creator in your face a few more times within 10 videos.. it’s just odd. You can’t quite discover new or be discovered like you use to. I also love the hypocrisy of their “community guidelines”.. if you tell someone to go F themselves, because they’re bullying you and saying mean things. Hurtful things. It doesn’t matter. If they report you first their provocation leading up to them crying and reporting me, is justified, allowed, and protected. This has happened a few times.

They take down videos that are not against the community guidelines like harassment/nudity/etc. they don’t take that down they take down fun/no problem/not against anything/ etc. they need to get better community guidelines and more let’s say stricter, on videos. I got banned on my account for being underage.

They repost BAD mental health videos and just knowing your friends are going through something similar, putting on a smile when they’re really\nnot okay. And getting exposed to that kind of content ruins your own mental health. Also seeing depressing videos make others people relate and get sucked into this whole other world where they thing their ugly, everyone hates them, their not good enough, basically no self love whatsoever. I personally have learned about new things that have harmed myself. For example eating disorders, I have a eating disorder now because of tiktok/social media because they make you belive you have to be skinny, have an hourglass body, have clear skin, smooth skin, pretty hair, EVERYTHING. I also would like to say I learned about sh which is self harm and now I have it because once you get exposed to it you tend to get sucked into wanting to do it, then a few seconds later boom I have a bunch of red marks in my arms, would buy clothes to fit in even when I hated wearing them.

That’s the dangerous thing about it. Something I don’t appreciate is that you can say “hi” or “hey” and still get banned, I don’t appreciate that. I once have said “ hello “ to a friend I have met online and got banned for 3 days. Roblox is a pretty good game but can also damage your vision. I’m not trying to act like a pick me but I assume you should wear glasses. I give Roblox 4 stars because of all of the issues. Another issue that probably all the robloxians hate is when Roblox will randomly have an issue, unexpectedly. You can be playing something and it will kick u out and u have to sign back into your account. This needs to be fixed. The good thing about Roblox is that it is very fun , and u can have a blast on this app. I really like Roblox but not the issues. Roblox is a very nice app and me and my friends will be on it a couple hours of the day, whenever we are bored. I also like that there are a ton of mini games to choose from. Games like royale high , adopt me , Bloxburg , put a finger down , the mimic , and ALOT more.

If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-11T00:40:28-07:00"},{"id":"8133598620","userName":"enhpad13","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1314954553","version":"22.1.0","score":3,"title":"The app is astounding, but...","text":"I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps.

I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don’t delete their accounts or apps. Don’t go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don’t scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things. Sometimes they are just nervous you’ll delete the app or account, or lose their online friendships. You can also download tiktok so you can see what your kid posts, and gain them a new follower !

It has become a popular platform for car enthusiasts to showcase their cars and share their passion for all things automotive. However, TikTok can be both great and bad for the car community for several reasons. On the positive side, TikTok provides a platform for car enthusiasts to connect and share their love for cars. It allows them to showcase their cars, share tips and tricks, and learn from other enthusiasts. It also allows them to connect with a larger audience and gain exposure for their content. On the negative side, TikTok can also be a breeding ground for misinformation, dangerous stunts, and reckless driving. Some users may post videos of themselves driving recklessly or performing dangerous stunts, which can give the car community a bad reputation. Additionally, some users may spread false information about cars or car maintenance, which can be harmful to both cars and their owners. Overall, TikTok can be a great tool for connecting with other car enthusiasts and sharing your love for cars. However, it's important to use the platform responsibly and avoid dangerous stunts or spreading false information.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-14T19:37:18-07:00"},{"id":"9122711135","userName":"shaggy and scobby","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1162634042","version":"26.2.0","score":2,"title":"Disgusting","text":"Tiktok Is disgusting they are allowing children to be exploited by their family. They are allowing a child to be groomed by the internet. And though they have nothing to do with it. They need to ban the accounts with children in them period. These children have no idea what their families are truly doing to them. As in the wren Eleanor situation, she has no idea what her mother is putting online. Shes just 3 years old and is having fun being filmed. She has no idea there are creeps on the internet saving her videos and doing who knows what with them. Just as the other kids on tiktok and instagram and really any kind of social media app, have no idea what the comments mean. There are ppl saying they are gonna kidnap a child. They are literally grooming children, and tiktok is allowing it. They love to ban just dancing videos (ones of adults), but when it comes to a child getting groomed by predators on the internet they are no where to be found?! It’s honestly disgusting these accounts are still up. And for any mother or father who runs across this, please i am begging you take your children off social media. Their lives need to be private until they are old enough to even understand what the concept of internet means, meaning a 6 year old is NOT old enough for the internet, any kid under 13 just shouldn't be on the internet. And even 13 year olds don't need to post themselves, there are predators please protect your children.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-09-25T23:04:28-07:00"},{"id":"8357285815","userName":"SweetBBW63","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id471428273","version":"23.1.0","score":2,"title":"Review Erased?","text":"I did submit a review and I never did see it pop up on here and then I looked again and saw it was gone. I have been waiting a couple days now since my life was banned. The reason they banned me was far from the truth as I do not drink and I do not smoke and I do not have any artillery. It seems that you were guilty until proven innocent and they really don’t respond to you whenever you submit anything to support and asked to know why or what happened so you know what it was. People can have a vendetta against you or they can feel threatened and then just report you and then you’re just shut down. This happened to me two Sundays ago and then it was removed and seeing that nothing was done on my part and then sure enough another week rolls around and on another Sunday the same thing happened and now it has taken days on the appeal. There needs to be a better process and I don’t think that it’s fair. I do think that TikTok is an excellent platform but they really need to work on customer service and personal interaction. I do agree with one review that I saw on here, where they said that they believe that if they don’t like you for whatever reason whether it is personal parents or whether you’re able to entertain the executives; or whether you’re able to bring in money, then this happens quite often until you are completely banned forever. What is society. What a horrible society.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=835599320&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-02-14T22:32:21-07:00"},{"id":"9772706616","userName":"Singin87","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id225452864","version":"28.4.1","score":5,"title":"Catered education, entertainment, and activism","text":"TikTok for myself is first and foremost an entertainment app. What’s amazing about it is how it’s algorithm will personally cater your feed to your interests and inevitably lead you to educational content that you are genuinely interested in and want to know more about. With plenty of opportunities to go down any rabbit hole you  receive well paced breaks from related content and even have moments when the app, get this, suggests you take a break and come back later. What started as an app teaching an entire generation how to express themselves in dance has turned into self help, political activism, crowd funding, mental health care, and an amazing fluid way to transfer ideas and of course the most amazing pet and animal videos that will take you on a well regulated entertainment journey. Thank you for your contributions to supporting the LGBTQIA and minority  communities via your app and for promoting a more worldly perspective. We are all on this one planet together and I hope Tik-Tok can help us all band together to protect it, educate ourselves, and share ourselves and our ideas with each other! Truly this is my favorite app on my phone and I encourage everyone to take advantage of this amazing algorithm!

Once I realized I was in a bad headspace and started working on myself as a person all together, I got on positive side of tiktok. So many down to earth people making content that not only helps me but others. So many comments “I needed this today” I know most people see tiktok as some dancing joking app but it genuinely has helped me feel less alone, gave me more ideas to further myself mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I feel more in touch with my true self than I ever have and I am honestly so grateful for this platform. The fact I am able to see every day people just like me talk about their vulnerable moments and that I am able to share content that I create. Yes it can be hard sometimes to get off the app because there is so much content that is wonderful to see but I believe there is an option to put a limit for yourself so you don’t spend too much of your day on here. I never thought I’d be writing a review for any app but I really do wanna put it out there this app is not just for jokes or dancing, although if you’re interested in that stuff I’m positive it’s on there for you.

I’ve seen literal naked women on this app and my videos get taken down because of a kitten?! seriously? i’ve also posted a tiktok here recently of me and my sister doing a transition video of us getting ready for the day and it has gotten taken down. Now my account is on a risk of getting permanently banned. This is so stupid, i really do not understand it. Other than that it’s an amazing app, but still fix that. I’ve sent an appeal but they said they couldn’t do anything about it and that i did break the community guidelines. Please stop banning my accounts because of this, i've seen so many worse things that or against minor safety but apparently a kitten is worse than a literal human organ? i do not understand it! please fix this.  It just happened again, it was a roblox story with my friends, it was taken down for minor safety and harassment and bullying. It was about how many words you have, seriously? fix this.

Their algorithm works well to reach audiences that want to follow and like your content but… their review process is very annoying. I do motorcycle content (@_OtherAdam_) safety content and funny skits but they seem to hate motorcycles and always flag my videos. My last video didn’t even have a reason, it just said community guidelines. I have tested their review process and I guess it depends on the person that gets to see judge your video and their views. For example it’s as if my videos often fall on the desk of a reviewer that hates motorcycles so they are just inclined to deamplify my video. So when I upload the same video twice. One will get removed because someone who reviewed it thought it was dangerous and the other one will go viral because someone reviewed it and didn’t feel it was dangerous. I’ve been dealing with this for 2 years on TikTok and have 230k followers so I’ve had time to come up with these conclusions. It has to be the only explanation since their customer service is non existent and you’re completely unable to get a hold of anyone regarding a issue. Other then that, it’s a great platform for going viral and most likely the best place to start if you want to be a content creator. TikTok please fix your review process.

The app is high school popularity in virtual form. There are so many deserving creators that go unseen on the app including me. I have practically worked two full time jobs trying to create original content that actually means something & constantly go unseen on the FYP, & cannot build my account! No matter how many tips & tricks you follow on this app you won’t go anywhere unless you can meet TikTok’s popularity standards! At this point it makes me wanna rid of the app all together & bring all my friends & family that joined because of my referral with me! Big accounts get bigger for doing nothing while small creators work their back sides off to wow people just to find out Tiktok is never gonna let any of your content go viral. Doesn’t matter how inspirational, kind, or creative it is! If you are drop dead beautiful, have money, or post half naked stuff. Tiktok will not push your content.

At first I watched “funny videos” about puppies. But it very quickly became a tool to learn. Political events, BLM, covid etc. I feel like it was the first time I could understand and see what people were actually going through. It helped me navigate my emotions and figure out how I could contribute to the world… our country…. My neighbors. It’s taught me what truth looks like and how untruthful the powers that be are. My grout lines are immaculate, I fixed my dryer, learned a ton of new recipes,learned that I’m not the only one fascinated with zit popping. I watched soooo many people become their creative selves, become stronger, teach and most importantly grow. I believe that TikTok has created a true sense of community….at least the start of one. I’m still bothered that the mediators take down content from creators simply because haters report it. There has got to be a better way for you guys to see what true bullying is. Please don’t silence the people that are trying to make the world better, educate us and respectfully show us our truth….science based truth…. Historical truth…. Social truth. They are the ones that will make this world a better place for all of us…. And the earth.

But they also switched the liked videos and private videos, and I honestly liked the stories and they got rid of it.

And have posted a few videos with me shooting. After this video got taken down I reposted it. And made another one with me shooting and that only. This was in December 2021. It has not been taken down since. Then 2 days ago I got I made another video with me and my friend. And got taken down for “minor safety” now both my friend and my dad suggested that it was due to the last 2 photos being in our bathing suits. And I agreed. Although I had zoomed in for that reason. To where it almost looks like a regular shirt or a tank top. I ended up getting temporarily  banned from posting. I then saw I could post again. And so I reposted the video. It got taken down again. I can’t post till tomorrow. I plan on reposting it. If it gets taken down again I’ll repost it again. I’m not going to take down my art because “TikTok says shoulders are not allowed” this isn’t elementary. So stop. I still enjoy TikTok but this is getting annoying.
