First of all, the daily spin and will is completely trash. There were many times where I was about to get a huge win and it slowed down but it keep spinning to a low number like 50. Then another time it slowed down really fast and landed on 75. You need to fix this issue. Another problem is the 1 free cash video. After you watch the video, it doesn’t give me cash. I’ve been stuck with 2 for a while and every time I watch the video it doesn’t give me anything. It’s a waste of time. The last thing is I preferred when you could buy the cues.

If you don’t spend your real hard earned cash then they won’t let you collect their fake game coins or advance to higher level play. 
It’s really to bad. I don’t have a lot of extra cash to throw away into this game but I do have a lot of time invested in the game and for them to add algorithms to force losses,scratches,no break 15 games in a row(random? I don’t think so),no balls potted on break, and fixed low pay wheel spins. I think I’ll go find a new game, one that emulates more closely the actual physics of real life billiards. It feels like if you give this game enough money you won’t even have to aim anymore. And if that’s your thing then this is the game for you. Otherwise even if you have good luck or skill in general it won’t apply here.

You’ll also end up behind the only ball left on the table, unable to make a shot — four games in a row. This rarely ever happens in real-life, but in this game the laws of physics don’t apply. Your ball does u-turns, stops mid-roll at the lip and doesn’t fall in, your cue ball keeps rolling like it’s been oiled, and your angles defy any geometry known to man. Also, to top things off, you’ll “accidentally” tap a million coin game and lose all your coins. Nothing in this game is random. It’s like being shaken down for your money in Vegas, but worse.

It’s too hard to challenge someone and too easy to miss them because you have to sit there and wait too long.  You need a much easier and efficient way for friends and others to connect and challenge someone. For example, a challenge could be put somewhere where it pops up like similar to playing actual pool by putting quarters on the table. It’s too easy to keep missing someone you want to play withCall pocket or call pocket for 8 ball. 
Add a button or way to change a pocket when you mistakenly pick or hit the wrong pocket and can’t change it. It’s easy to call the wrong pocket by hitting it accidentally and there is no way to unpick it and call the right one. Charge some coins to unpick pockets accidentally or ??

So the levels/cities to play in are SIX with a $50,000 entry fee or lower and TEN with an entry fee of $100,000 to $25 million per game! 

Honestly... do you guys really think the AVERAGE PLAYER has 25 MILLON chips to pay the ENTRY FEE to play ONE game of pool?

 I have acquired all 🏆🏆🏆 from the lower levels and now I’m  attempting to complete the trophies in Toronto at the $100,000 entry fee level per game. 8 Ball Pool has more higher entry fee levels than lower fee ones! I’m now becoming quickly bored with 8 Ball Pool which I hate because I really like playing it...😕 

I want to suggest you should add a few more cities with lower entry fees and trophies to win! It would keep your players interested playing the game instead of leaving out of frustration b/c when you lose a game you also lose trophies previously won! 

I think in all fairness if four cities/levels with $250 $1000 $5000 $25,000 were added to the game with more chances to win 🏆🏆🏆it would be such an improvement to the fun this game offers your players already!🙂",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-11T05:22:57-07:00

Maybe be able to leave the game you are currently in but get your money back and leave your record alone? Something needs to be done to fix this.

I feel like sometimes the ball doesn’t go where you aim, and also the cue will travel much much farther than with the lower you hit it at. As an example I used like 10% power and the cue traveled almost the full length of the table. 

I’m also hoping that people that pay for coins don’t get preferential treatment I. The way the ball handles when you hit it. Sometimes I feel that may be the case.

Overall it’s a solid game and I enjoy it. Give us the ability to talk to each other how we would like. Nothing wrong with some good ol trash talking.

1) the game seems rigged. I have seen several times my ball go from rollling one way and suddenly to a quick curve that causes me to me out. 
2) after I hit my ball in the direction I want it to go then the white ball seems to pick up speed and will roll a little extra than it should causing me to get out again. 
3) my number 1 complaint here would be the time in which we have to wait while in the middle of a game while the other player gets a text or bad reception it makes us the player wait at least 2 minutes. Then they get to continue the game. Some games I’m waiting 2 minutes in between every shot because the other player keeps stalling the game. I think if the game notices that they are doing this on purpose it should end their game automatically. There’s just too much time waisted. 
4) My last upset is I’m currently at level 67 and when I play the game matches me up with players in the 100’s and higher levels. I don’t understand why? When I was at lower levels it only matched me up with players at my level.

I will continue playing and I do recommend this game as a great game. I do hope these issues will be addressed soon.

For example: I’m a level 12 and it’s putting me against people level 120+. I’m still trying to figure out the complete controls and which cues to use but run out of coins before I get the chance because I lose 90% of my matches agonist these more seasoned players. They also have was seems like glitches where you hit a ball into a pocket and then that ball ends back up on the table (as if you never made it) and the other player then run the table with a some insane shots and never missing a single one. Really defeats to purpose of wanting to play…,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-12T14:13:59-07:00

Our club won third place in the league and I placed in the top 20 within the club.  However, I did not receive my portion of the club award.  After several emails back and forth they said that the case was closed any any other contact from me was considered spam.  I did not feel they did their due diligence in researching the issue.  Screen shots will now be the norm right before the end of the event and after.
2. When playing 1v1, there is no way to confirm your selection.  While scrolling through, I accidentally selected a much higher stakes game than I have ever played and there was no way to back out.  In 9-Ball, you have to confirm your selection before going forward.
3.  The cue ball action takes some very dramatic spins and turns that forces a scratch.  No way some of those shots are possible IRL.  Happens to both me and my opponents so I guess it evens out but still very frustrating.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-15T07:33:17-07:00

That being said, the stream of pop ups and blatant attempts at micro transactions before you even start up a game,  and then after is egregious. This is one of those times that I’d actually like an option to pay to turn off pop ups and microtransaction promotions.

Also the wheel spin minigame is rigged to only land on 3-4 of the rewards, all being pretty low compared to the other rewards, but slightly better than the worst to make you feel like you’re still winning. Actually, that’s what pretty much every part of this game does, between the plethora of different rewards handed out at your every move (tokens, cash, spins, cues, loot crates, chat options, etc.). 

Are there any good pool games that don’t annoy and poach on their users?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-04T11:20:01-07:00
