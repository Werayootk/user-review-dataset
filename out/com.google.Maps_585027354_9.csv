But with each update to the app, it seems to get less reliable. I had been holding off on the last 3 or 4 updates when my iPhone 6 finally stopped working for good yesterday, so I upgraded to an iPhone 8. Well, the newest version of Google Maps was installed, and today is my first try of real world use.

Disappointed to report that while driving on an interstate the app thought I was driving on the outer road 3 times during the trip. Just out of nowhere, going down a straight interstate the app suddenly tells me to make a left turn to get back on the highway. Not once, not twice, but THREE times. Glitchy? I need this to work. I‚Äôm giving up just as much personal information to Google just like everyone else. The least you can do is keep your app reliable. Why ‚Äúfix‚Äù something that wasn‚Äôt broken in the first place?

Also, I don‚Äôt know who is working on your UI, but you just need to stop. Just stop what you‚Äôre doing and go do something else. Go to the park. Adopt a puppy.

The other big problem is the simplistic algorithm that seems to be programmed to give you the fastest route, regardless of how unreasonable that option may be - for example, you may be instructed to take a new route to save 1 min but adds 5 turns.

We had used Hiatt Construction for small jobs over several years and asked them to help us work with our repair and associated remodeling. They were excellent and had the lowest price. Much of the cost of the damage was covered by insurance and Hiatt dealt directly with the insurance company and kept us well informed over the 3+ months it took to complete everything. 

While a large construction project is never easy or without complications this went about as smooth as any I have ever been associated with. (My father was a general contractor and I had lots of person experience with the business over many years,)

Hiatt handled all subcontractors and every business involved with our project. They made sure we were fully informed and knew our options and helped get it done!

And they followed up on everything we asked them to do including dealing with any mistakes or damage done by subcontractors in a timely manner. 

We recommend Hiatt without reservation and continue to use them whenever we can on projects big or small!

There was an update recently that has changed the way the app is reading my location. It‚Äôs not as precise and often does not zoom in closer to my location when I am in neighborhoods or areas with lots of streets. It has made navigating these areas a bit stressful because I have to slow down and wait for google maps to catch up with me. It also seems to change its mind about my position on the street when I‚Äôm stopped at a stop sign or in a parking lot (or even just parked on the street.) It will show my position correctly for a moment and then decide I‚Äôm facing 90¬∞ to the right and recalculate my directions based on that. Then when I start moving again it has to recalculate again. I don‚Äôt trust Google maps anymore and will probably start using my iPhone Maps app instead.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-22T06:20:01-07:00

The new color scheme is absolutely awful on the eyes. The saturation is so high that it actually decreases the contrast between roads and direction arrows. Those arrows are even harder to see on CarPlay due to this low contrast issue and being very small. 

The other thing was changing the navigation to 3D. Terrible terrible experience on CarPlay. The 3D buildings take a while render completely and the resolution is so low near the edge of the screen that it actually hurts looking at the screen. And these blocks of 3D cubes that contribute nothing to my trips are really just there to distract me from reading my actual routes.
