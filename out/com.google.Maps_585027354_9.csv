Recently I was traveling toward Shreveport Airport and google maps led me to a casino in the downtown area away from the airport, then directed from the casino to the airport. This route was no way the fastest and safest route. It required a U turn between fast moving traffic and another to get back on a freeway I had already been on. Either google maps was paid to take me by the Casino or the app was hijacked by the casino. Either way it was a disappointment to be lead away from the airport. Luckily I had left extremely early so I could return the rental car and make my flight.
