I recently upgraded to a new cell phone & had difficulty getting Gmail to unlock my account to give me access with the 2 step verification turned on.  I eventually got in through recovery and turned off the 2 step verification process.  I discovered that your gmail app had changed & no longer had the “sign out” option under the Gmail user profile.  I couldn’t close & log out the my Gmail account app from my new cell phone.  I looked under the Help tips for the log out options.  It stated the only way to close & log out of your Gmail account is to remove the app from your account device manager or leave it open.   Also, it stated depending on which device you're logged into will depend on if you have the sign out option access or not.  I have it on my laptop when I log into Gmail.  My old cellphone also had the sign out option for Gmail so I could log out of my account, but it’s not an option on my new cellphone.  It leaves my Gmail account unlocked & accessible to potential users or hackers through the back door.  This is poor security programming in the system’s application.
