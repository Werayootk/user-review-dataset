This new update that forces me to open the app every single time is anti productive. Not every email I receive needs my immediate attention, so I don‚Äôt always open them right away. However, there are a few that require special attention and I can no longer differentiate between important and nonessential emails with the new notifications system. Therefore, I am turning off notifications altogether and I will check all of my emails at the same time; which is when I get to them! Edit: Newest update fixed the problem. Google, seriously don‚Äôt do that again. That was so annoying, I even considered switching to yahoo mail (ü§Æ).
