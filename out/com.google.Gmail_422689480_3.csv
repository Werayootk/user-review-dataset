I half-expect them to write in all-caps, yell at the screen, and use exclamations points everywhere. So first of all, I’m totally chill. I just bought a brand new iPad Pro and I downloaded 10 different email apps to test them out and see which one was the best for me. I am actually pumped!

Reasons for low-star review:
 - UNCLEAN: When you clear your inbox, you want your eyes to be directed toward the most important information. Unfortunately, I found my eyes locked on the least important information while I was using the app. 
- FOLDER USAGE: I added something to a folder and it disappeared completely. (Toggling between my folder list from the “move to” option) 
	Obviously I understand some of this could be not knowing how to use the app, but there was no instruction on how to use it when I opened it. I also come from an engineering background, and am really good at this stuff. If I can’t figure it out, who can?

I had really hoped that customizability would be better and more abundant as well.

These are my biggest complaints. IT’S GOOGLE! I really have enjoyed a lot of their products. I use Google Calendar more than the calendar from Apple. Although it’s not perfect, it’s better than the Apple calendar. I guess I just thought they were the elite, so I held them to a higher standard.

These days this term is so overloaded that, whenever I see it, my first reaction personally is to open an app that deals with TEXT/SMS messages, and not to open an app for eMail. In this, I think I’m probably not alone. I mean, it also could be a note from the little red headed girl in the third grade. Or a telegraph from the War Department. Or the WOW signal.  Point is, how much in resources would it take to add 5 characters “email” (or even just “mail”…4 characters!) to disambiguate the notification?

However, this app is the only one I have a problem with. When viewing/using gmail through browser everything is fine, so this issue is mainly for the app and not the system itself.

I'm a small business owner so I have multiple gmail accounts. One for customer service, one for my personal stuff, one for jobs/hiring/interviews, and one just for all of the junk that I sign up for but don't want to crowd my other inboxes.

When viewing/using through browser, everything is kept separate. It even opens up an entirely new window when switching accounts. 

On this app, even though I can switch through my accounts, all of my mail is jumbled together. I'm clicking on my customer service account but my inbox is full of newsletter I signed up for on my junk account. Or even worse, the same email is in EVERY account even though it's being sent to just one.

Everything is mixed and it makes it really hard to stay on top of my emails when nothing is synced or where it's supposed to be. 

Please fix this. When Covid-19 is controlled and the public opens up again, I'll be thrown back into replying to emails between running errands and having mixed inboxes should be the last thing I have to navigate through.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-18T16:38:28-07:00

Now if I wanna attatch something I have to either scroll recent photos or click camera roll which opens the moments tab of photo library.

Inbox and go with Gmail I was perplexed. But we were promised the same functionality, so what the hell, I guess I’ll give it a try. Well, let me tell you, I’m beyond disappointed.

For starters, Inbox would organize all emails into neat categories: Promotions, Purchases, important stuff, and what not. Everything other than important stuff didn’t trigger a notification which is fine by me because I get a ton of spam. It was easier to clean up too.

Next, visually Inbox was far better organized. Emails had visual cues, reminders and things related to your calendar had a different layout, etc. Again, it made your inbox easier to organize.

There was also the “Done” functionality. Essentially it meant that with one click you could make an email disappear from the main view but it wasn’t deleted. Just moved somewhere else.

None of that exists for Gmail. Quite frankly, Gmail hasn’t changed since it was released (visual, layout, etc). I’m not one for fix what ain’t broken but for the love of god, could we step into the 21st century? I understand wanting to be simplistic but too much simplicity doesn’t give you much flexibility.

Long story short, I’m moving to Outbox because at least their app gives me some room to organize in an easy, user friendly way which Gmail really doesn’t.

In fact, the app doesn’t even show you the signature, it simply gets applied after sending the message. To further confuse the sender and recipient when replying to a message your signature will be applied to the bottom of the entire thread, not just your reply at the top, and again you won’t see this because the signature isn’t shown to the sender.

1. That Important label business. I just wanted it to go away - I never asked for it, it just happened to me. I still don’t entirely understand it! I delete emails, but they continue to haunt me in Important. If I never read them - and sometimes, an email doesn’t need to be read to delete it, am I right? - then the stupid app shows me unread flags thanks to that Important business. Again, DELETED emails. Why, Google? When I search for solutions, none affect the app - so I’ve been stuck with this issue.

2. Email threads. Initially, I appreciated this feature. I’m old school - I used a text-based email program for years, and I miss it. It also threaded - most programs do! Replies get placed next to originals. This is helpful. For some reason, Google decided to hide that things were threaded? Again, I don’t entirely understand this, I just know how it affects me. Here, emails I HAVEN’t deleted disappear. In the thread it will show one then skip one and show another. Where do they go? I’m not sure, but it’s been more than a little upsetting.

There aren’t any filters you can apply in the inbox: to sort by the mail you haven’t read yet, you have to type “label:unread”.

The search doesn’t seem to recognize people’s names when searched for, once more, in order to filter the inbox. When searching for their emails, it recognizes any part of the email address in all other correspondence with a part of that address, and includes it in the results. Not helpful to sort things if your organization all has the same domain name in said address.

I like the control it gives me over how I view my inbox as well as what push notifications I am sent.

Google is getting rid of inbox at the end of March and I downloaded (again) the gmail app thinking that major improvements had been brought and it would give me the same level of control.

Day 14: I still can not stand this stuffed inbox. Even emails I have set up to be sent to folders are set as labels now and still appear in the main mail box until I archive them.

This makes things like nest or memberships with lots of update emails a massive jam and each email now has to be individually taken care of instead of allowing the system to deal with it.

Only social and promotions have been brought over to gmail and they work okay. I do not enjoy seeing sponsored ads in the depths of my personal email, but hey, it’s google after all.

Managing multiple email addresses has become smoother yet more cumbersome at the same time. I can easily see all mail boxes at the same time but now I need to do 3 times the work due to the folder issues because I am flooded with notifications I wasn’t receiving before.

All and all I am going to follow how my work email is set up and utilize outlook.

From my desktop I am able to send emails to groups I have created in Google Contacts which is a quick and easy way to communicate with my various teams. 

However, this is not an available option through the gmail app. If I want to email everyone on “Project A” for example, I must type in all of their emails separately. There is no other way to do it. Meanwhile on desktop I can simply begin to type the group name and POOF! There it is.

Sometimes after checking my mail the notifications circle wouldn’t update and I would keep refreshing my screen to see if I had more mail. It has gotten to the point where I would check my laptop before my phone would notify me of an email. I have checked the settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and nothing has changed.

I emailed customer support and the response I got back offered a refund for the cost of the 5x7’s.  For some reason the refund was .05 less than the cost I paid. 

I could overlook the .05 difference , but then I realized that didn’t cover the tax I paid, plus I had to pay for shipping again to get the correct size prints. In addition, I had to reorder the prints and wait for them to ship again. 

I replied to their offer, mentioning the .05 difference and their response was that they were glad I could overlook it. Hope they follow this rule if I am short when I pay for my order. 

I also mentioned that they should cover shipping the new prints since I already paid for shipping and it was their error in sending the wrong size prints. 

Again, they replied. They said they would cover the shipping, but only after I received and replied to an email confirming my new order with a tracking number. 

Although they made an attempt to make things right with me, I feel they could have offered much better customer service than an incorrect refund and asking me to jump through hoops to get my correct order and final refund. 

I will definitely be looking for other photo printing options in the future.

The signature on mobile app always comes with to dashes before it (`—`). There is no place to delete it and when you turn on the mobile signature the email sent out is so ugly because the dash will be added to the end of your email automatically (since you cannot delete it) and your signature will be in a new line.

Now that they are doing away with Inbox, I’d love to see these things come over to Gmail:

Swiping emails in Inbox gave you the option of both Delete AND archive. I would love that on Gmail. 

Archiving whole categories is amazing. I could scroll thru my emails in a category, read what I wanted, deleted or save to a tag/folder what I wanted, then back out of the category and archive the whole thing. Brilliant. No more selecting every individual email for archive or deletion. It was the key to keeping a tidy Inbox. This is really something I’d love to see in the Gmail App.

Having more auto categories for Shopping, Finance, etc were very nice. I’d love to see more categories be brought to Gmail as a whole. 

Lastly, it was wonderful to see my trips categorized automatically. This was a great feature that I will sorely miss. Being able to have all my reservations for a business trip or vacation quickly available rather than having to search for a specific email while at the counter was wonderful.

It’s not cool that  Forever 21 and a bunch of other stores don’t even have coupons or sales and can send me thousands of emails with expiration dates on them now I’m up to 60,000 and can’t receive anymore.
I’ve had the same Gmail since I was 18 years old now I’m stuck deleting them one by one  
when I should be able to delete all from Forever 21, at once, I unsubscribed, but I still have thousands of emails from them. That aren’t even valid all stores that have an expiration date on the email should be able to automatically delete after the email is expired.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-18T16:11:33-07:00
5168573822,SimStar47,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id472605256,6.0.191023,1,Won’t let me reply to emails!!,"I don’t usually write reviews. However, there is something seriously wrong with the Gmail app and it needs to be fixed immediately. 

What might that be?

It won’t let me reply to emails. Which is... kinda a big deal, seeing as that’s the entire purpose of this app! 

Whenever I press the reply button (whether it’s the one at the top, by the name of the sender, or the one at the bottom, next to the forward button), it takes me to a blank white screen. After a few moments, the sender information (sender, recipient, heading, etc). It allows me to edit the heading, but if I click on the large white space below it (where the previous emails and an area for my response should be) it doesn’t do anything. I’ve tried to let it load, but it never renders anything.

After more experimentation, I’ve concluded that this only happens when you have a chain of 20+ emails. I seem to be having no difficulties with small exchanges, only the prolonged interactions. I’m not having this issue on any laptops or computers, or the Gmail site. It’s only the app.

Fellow app users: Thank you for reading my admittedly longwinded review.

App developers: Please get this fixed as soon as possible. My job requires a lot of immediate responses to emails, and when I’m running from meeting to meeting, it just isn’t practical to have to pull out a laptop to respond to a two-sentence email.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-19T05:37:18-07:00

I actually updated the app accidentally so that’s on me BUT....since then I have had repeated problems with the app not letting me “reply” to a message and oh my gosh it infuriates me so much!! I really don’t like the update anyway but to be right in the middle of an email conversation and then the app just won’t let me respond. I have deleted-reinstalled a few times in the past two weeks. It has temporarily helped but has eventually gone back to the reply problems. And today’s attempt to get it cooperating it will let me log in,see messages then when I click one to respond it gives me the screen telling about Smart Compose. I have tried to tap the “got it” bar but it’s stuck at that point. Omg!!! Fix the problem FAST please.....I have had no prior problems with Gmail until updating last week and I’m so disgusted and angry that I have had this many problems in only two weeks...maybe less.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-06T09:19:42-07:00

Update/upgrade gmail /gmail app/google gmail 

If you guys see this it be really appreciated

I just want to say that I have a problem, every day when I use gmail I keep getting spam emails from dating emails and porn emails  and it really annoying and I think it be a great idea if you guys made a update/upgrade to gmail on all phone gmail apps and laptop gmail. 

I think that for this update/upgrade you guys could add a new feature we’re it would work like this . It would be a new button we’re if you click this button it will stop all inappropriate emails and inappropriate spam emails from your emails account forever.

And if something that shouldn’t be there happened to end up in there you can select it and move it into your regular emails group. And you have a amount of days until it’s deleted and blocked forever.

It’s really annoying that I get porn emails and dating emails and pill emails every single day and I will an other people with my problems will really appreciated it if you guys could change and help with this problem.

Please help 

And it be amazing if you can add this feature on all phone an pc and tablet and computer platforms forever.

If you guys could do this it be really appreciated and I think other people would appreciate it to.

Thanks for your help and hope y’all have a great day:DeAndrew Powell",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-30T05:07:11-07:00
