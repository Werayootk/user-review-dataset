You would think a tech company with the capabilities MS has, they could prevent junk e-mail from ever entering your email box.  There is repeated emails about lawsuits, Lowes, keurig, etc.  Why does my email ever have to be exposed to this?  Why does my eyes ever have to see this?  Sure, it goes in the junk mail folder, but I need to scan that folder for mistakes.  Hence, it’s a huge time waste.  Setting up rules only works for items that make it to your inbox.

The items flagged by MS as junk can’t be controlled by rules to make them go to the delete folder.  They go directly to the junk folder and there’s nothing you can do but review and delete.  If you don’t do this daily, you have a huge mess.

Why is this?  Could it be that MS gets money from these spammers to allow this KNOWN junk into your email account?  Well, here I go wasting time again documenting a well known problem.  Spend real $ on this?  Right!

In a typical mail-reply situation where you have to respond attaching two documents you have on your Dropbox account now you can’t do it with Outlook.

I could go on but it boils down to lazy programming, which is the new norm.
[Revised 7/22] 
No upgrades to the interface since my original review. Microsoft is not listening to me. Or you.
I am a function guy. Fashion is nice, but function rules.
Still no way to customize account icons, so there’s still no way to tell which icon is associated with which email account. This is no big deal if you have one or even two accounts, but many people have many accounts. Full blown Outlook for PC is a pretty snazzy program once you learn it, and as a tech I did. You can’t expect a mobile application to perform like a desktop program. But this is an easy fix, guys.

 - The dark theme seems like an afterthought. They just turned the background black and the text white and called it a day seemingly. It’s not easy to see the text at times, especially for the gray tones and the pure white is harsh on the almost pure black background.

- Too many buttons at times. There’s a set of buttons at the bottom to switch between mail, calendar, etc. and there’s a set of menus at the left for changing account and for viewing different mailboxes within the account (if in the mail tab at least). It seems like the app is trying to do too much at once with limited screen real estate. A little like they ported some UI ideas from the desktop version.

It does not permit me(or anyone) to build or even convey an existing personalized, branded signature in emails generated from the mobile application.
This is significant because sometimes critical or time sensitive communication between businesses are sent without my/our standard logo signature as when they are generated on my laptop or desktop computer.  It creates an inconsistent look in communication. 
Some, or even most times this may not be as important, however there are other times that this is more critical or advantageous.
