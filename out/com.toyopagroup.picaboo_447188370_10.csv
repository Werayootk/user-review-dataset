You can get to know new people and add people you already know. You can text send pictures and videos use filters and much more very fun.

11087613620,Noah6255,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1333021362,12.79.0.33,3,A few things,"Hey,

Snapchat is a great app, don‚Äôt get me wrong. However it frustrates me that this app drains my iPhone battery quickly whilst my location services being turned off and me using wifi, not cellular data and low power mode as well as the in-app data saver. Also since the last update I started to see a glitch where in the area you view someones location under their name on their chat, if they are in a different state or country, I see something that says, (EXAMPLE) ‚Äú12:43 pm local time‚Äù. And then it switches back to the persons location. However once I exit the chat and go onto another and that persons location is enabled it shows a blank area where their location should be displayed. To fix this issue I usually have to restart the entire app or go onto the same chat where I saw the message ‚Äú12:43 PM local time‚Äù. I just find this annoying as this never happened and unsure the point of having a message say the persons time whilst being able to see the place time via the snap map section. Thanks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-26T06:49:01-07:00
