It’s probably my most used app. I have multiple group chats with friends, family and coworkers. My only gripe is when I get a notification on my Apple Watch all I can do is click on the notification. It might be wishful thinking or just entitlement, but I really wish there was a way for me to open the chat and reply to text chats. I could understand not adding the actual photo and video portion, but just the text chats would be amazing and really improve my personal experience with the app. 

I don’t know if anyone else in the world out there feels the same way but if you do, please leave a similar review so hopefully they can implement something along these lines.

But now they’re trying to do too much & are attempting to compete with tiktok for some reason. Plus it tries to compete with all the other companies who are attempting to make their own AI’s. I’d rate snapchat higher if the Snapchat AI wasn’t at the top of my chats 24/7. The Ai is the worst thing to have ever been added to the app. At least all the other bells and whistles can be easily ignored, but the AI is constantly there. It’s not even a good AI chat bot either.
To make it worse, Snapchat doesn’t let you move it or get rid of it unless you buy their useless subscription “Snapchat +”
Snapchat has been a part of my life since early highschool & I have an ongoing streak with so many people, but I’ve considered deleting the app because of the AI bot constantly being there.

If you would like you can pay $12 a month just so it doesn’t show at the top of you chat feed.

Snapchat has a incredible variety of filters you can use while taking pictures or videos.
I use snapchat every day. Not only can you send pictures directly to someone, you can use your stories! There are private stories which you can pick who would be able to see what you post. And there is just your general story where every one can see what you post on there!

It has completely ruined the vibe of snapchat and honestly I feel like at this point snapchat is finding ways to ruin the app. Everyone misses the old bitmojis and mostly everyone wants the old bitmoji and old snapchat feel back. And I agree. And then they added the new Ai. Honestly it was fun at first I will admit but now it’s getting annoying. Always being pinned at the top has gotten on my nerves. I would like the option to block the Ai because it’s honestly not needed. It also has come to my concern that the Ai posted a video or picture not too long ago and snapchat never gave us answers and tried to gaslight us into thinking nothing happened. A little weird right?
