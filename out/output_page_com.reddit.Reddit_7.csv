I find this to be really engaging and make me want yo use Reddit more. 3)the bots that downvote real user posts/comments and upvote their own accounts. Reddit feels very fake this days.

Keep Reddit and it’s potential pure,  avoid any role in ‘political’ moderation and only screen for statements that are TRULY hate-filled (not just different from your views).

- videos sometimes load improperly or if you rewind on a video you loose all sound. 
- gifs load improperly if at all also you guys took away the length bar of the gif to see how long it was. 
- commenting UI pretty much died. If I reply to a comment and need I look at the comment I’m replying to for reference, I can no longer do it. 
- account information disappears and I need to relogin sometimes. 
- using my location for to find post near me? Why? If I’m not interested in a certain subreddit I don’t need to see the post just because someone within a mile posted it. 
- suggested subreddits based on other subreddits I’m subscribed to? If your taking my location you should know I’m not going to subscribe to another’s cities sports team.

When I’m scrolling, the video it decides to play audio for (if it plays anything at all or only a single video) is usually something that’s partially offscreen or at least at the very bottom instead of the middle to top of the screen.

Not really a nice way to put it, but the most succinct description I have for it currently. The new “sidebar” to the left of replies adds an unnecessary amount of spacing above and below comments, which makes replies to a comment look like they’re unrelated. Also, it’s somehow messing with the automatic ordering of comments compared to before. Every reply looks nearly twice as “tall” as it was before updating, and the gray bar looks out of place in dark mode. If it looked more like the mobile website, where it essentially links the replies below it and continues downwards, then this wouldn’t be an issue to complain about, but it’s just disjointed and distracting while detracting from the UX as it spaces things out too much.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-29T13:03:30-07:00

Features offered by other (now dead) apps and the old website are missing, and frequent UI changes are consistently for the worse.

Now, a bad app is just a bad app, and perhaps there is the chance for positive change in the future. That being said, if the past app changes are telling of the future, I highly doubt it, and I won’t be a user of it anyway to find out for myself.

What is truly despicable, however, is the spam positive reviews with broken nonsensical sentences for this app inflating the total rating. I simply cannot believe that allowing 5-star bot reviews on an app is permissible under the App Store TOS. Reddit clearly benefits from these bot reviews, so at a minimum the Reddit app should be delisted, and Apple should try to implement a more thorough and stringent filter for fake accounts and reviews. I am pessimistic of if these two things will ever happen, but anything less erodes trust in the App Store.

But if a company removes the main service that was beneficial to me, then I will disagree vocally and if nothing changes then I will leave. I owe my allegiance to not a single corporation.

Such is what is currently happening with Reddit. They completely removed the main feature that was the sole reason why I used the app. Reddit removed the ability to sort the home feed. You can still see ""popular"", ""hot"", and ""new"" under different categories now. But there is no way to filter by ""rising""

""Rising"" was the only thing that kept my attention. I liked to join in on comment threads early on and possibly have short conversations with real people. WITHOUT having to shovel through the utter garbage that is ""new/latest"".

So with this recent update I can only see posts that have either thousands of upvotes, or zero upvotes. Nothing in between.

This is not the first time they've tried this. A few months ago they tested removing this option. I got so frustrated with reddit that ended up deleting the app until they reverted the change.

This “shadow ban” is the same as a regular permanent ban the only difference is a typical permanent ban explains why and what you did wrong and notifies you of your ban, whereas shadow bans do not. 

Reddit is slowly trying to get rid of NSFW content in order to win over investors. They started by mass banning lots of less popular NSFW subreddits and now they are outright banning loyal users who post NSFW content.
