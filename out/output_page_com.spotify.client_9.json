If I didn‚Äôt have these issues consistently EVERY DAY at least 2-3 times then maybe I‚Äôd consider paying for better version but app has a long way to go in my opinion and if rogan wasn‚Äôt here I would not even Be listening or using all at all.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-09T06:04:49-07:00"},{"id":"5802800133","userName":"mslmkg","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id727925569","version":"8.5.53","score":5,"title":"Good, but can get better","text":"I have a only 1 suggestion for the app. First of all, I just want to get out of the way that this app is absolutely remarkable. It‚Äôs magnificent. I will never use any other music platform. The fact that I only have one suggestion is me saying how good it is. I totally recommend it.\nHere is my suggestion:\nYou should actually give us 30 minutes of ‚Äúuninterrupted music‚Äù when you say you will. I got that add, then it made me watch a video, then played one song. Then it did it after that. Song. That is a straight up lie. I don‚Äôt know if those ads are randomized or not. If they are, can you make it how it waits 30 minutes until playing that ad and any other ad please?\nOtherwise, this app is to amazing to describe in words.\n10/5 stars in my eyes. :D","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-04-12T16:12:33-07:00"},{"id":"6961661043","userName":"heksvakheovdvjsosveosve","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1182316604","version":"8.5.96","score":4,"title":"Love this app, few complaints.","text":"I love this app, just a few complaints. First of all, I don‚Äôt like how it adds songs to a playlist I made, and I barely even know them. Adding onto that, I don‚Äôt like how it only allows 6 skips per hour, because after I skip through the songs the add on I have no skips left. They also make it so you can‚Äôt skip back to a song. Sometimes I press skip by accident and then I can‚Äôt go back. Also, they say watch this video for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. It‚Äôs more like 20 for me. Also, the adds are constantly the same thing, even after I‚Äôve put a bad review on them. One last thing. I don‚Äôt know if this is my phone itself or it is the app, but after about an hour of music it randomly stops playing. \n\nOver all this app if fantastic, but it would make it better if they changed the things I just listed.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-02-06T07:58:39-07:00"},{"id":"6521440142","userName":"anschnitz","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1184998650","version":"8.5.79","score":1,"title":"So many ads I expect them more often then music","text":"I had premium for years on and off. I‚Äôve switched to the free version since covid.... \nIt‚Äôs literally unbelievable how many ads there are now. I hate this app now. There used to be a set algorithm where you got so and so amount of skips (6) and 30 minutes of ad-free music. Now they changed their algorithm so it‚Äôs different depending on what playlist you‚Äôre listening to. I just listened to 1 song after listening to a FEW MINUTES of ads and then skipped like 5 songs bc I didn‚Äôt like the playlist I had going and I had to listen to MORE ADS. When those were done I changed the playlist to my liked songs and I GOT MORE ADS FOR ‚Äú30 minutes of uninterrupted listening‚Äù- that‚Äôs a rarity now. Lately they‚Äôve been giving ads with no guaranteed amount of time after it that you get ad-free listening. \n\nThere are a lot of good things but right now I can‚Äôt see past all the ads I‚Äôm being bombarded with. I‚Äôve literally gotten to the point where I expect ads to play next before I expect music to play.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-10-10T11:52:29-07:00"},{"id":"6176015774","userName":"Riley Austin","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1103530295","version":"8.5.65","score":4,"title":"üëçüèªü§≠","text":"This app is great!!! I‚Äôve had it for about maybe 2 years and i just got premium about a year ago and it works amazing! The only 2 problems I have is the recommended songs I listen to my playlist and after 5 songs a random song comes on and I have no idea what it is and it‚Äôs annoying when I go to sleep with music on. And also some of my downloaded playlists and my liked songs won‚Äôt play offline and it‚Äôs annoying because your listening to ur playlist like for example me listening to my likes playlist while camping with no service and all the sudden none of my songs are playing except some and so I have to click on another song and some of the songs that aren‚Äôt playing that are downloaded are my favorites and it‚Äôs very irritating.

Small tweaks make a big difference to users. I‚Äôve been a customer for years and now I‚Äôm afraid we must part ways. One day a song I added to my playlist is there the next it‚Äôs gone or unplayable. It‚Äôs just not an attractive to me anymore. Idk why it has to be so difficult to organize/personalize your playlists. I always forget where to find it. Idk why you hide the search bar in a playlist, I always forget it‚Äôs there lol. I don‚Äôt like how I can‚Äôt change the playlist photo through mobile app because I don‚Äôt have a computer or laptop ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So I have this playlist with new songs but the cover is of the first four songs I added to the playlist years ago. Nobody is going to add that playlist or listen to it lol.
