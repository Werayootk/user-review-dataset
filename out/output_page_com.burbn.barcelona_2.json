It's not a huge hive of right-wing idiots talking about how great their ideas are. This is unfortunately what Twitter has devolved into and why I left it. \n2. The layout is very user friendly and feels smooth and intuitive. \n3. Most interactions on the app result in learning something and not feeling like a complete IQ drain, which you can't say about Twitter. It feels like there is meaningful interactions, which gives the app itself purpose.\n\nHowever, there are several issues that need to be worked on for this app to be truly great, and here is what they could be in my opinion:\n\n1. Set up a better search function so that it is easier to find topics and ongoing things that you are interested. \n2. Make it easier to find people and topics that you are interested in by building on the integrated search functionality.\n3. Although the \"For you\" section of the app is good, I think there needs to be a rework in what people can choose what they would like to see instead of just basing the content based off of what you like and follow already.\n\nSo to sum it up, it is good and not great so far and has a long way to go to be truly awesome.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-20T03:53:01-07:00"},{"id":"10258151799","userName":"MarkCherk","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id561218877","version":"296.0","score":4,"title":"Change the App Cover","text":"Two things \n\n1: Now that Twitter is X they have gone with a black and white themed app cover. Which is exactly the same as Threads but with an X instead of the threads logo. Which causes me to sometimes accidentally open X instead of threads. So if I had one wish it would be that the threads logo could change to maybe the background color being white and the threads logo being black. Or put Instagram colors in the threads character since it is technically an Instagram App. Anything to make it look different. \n\n2: Maybe I am misunderstanding how this app is intended to work but if this apps purpose is to be a more stable Twitter then it‚Äôs missing a major feature. \nThat feature is when you go to search you can only find other accounts. But on Reddit, X and even Instagram when I hit search it  gives me tabs for accounts and other things including the latest feed from people who post anything with the # related to what I put in.
