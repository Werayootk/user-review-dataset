The crew mates job is to finish their tasks before the impostor wins. The impostors job is to kill all the crew mates before the crew mates win. You can also report body‚Äôs and call emergency meeting to discuss who is sus(suspicious.)  There is a chat box to discuss. If you see someone vent or kill you can report the body if you can go to the body or if you see them vent or kill run to the emergency meeting button.(if they vent or kill they are the impostor, there can be one, two, or three impostors.) you can host a game so you can create a game or you can join a game. But sometimes the game that you choose they may have already started and you may have to join a different one. The one weird thing is the host or if you host a game you can ban some people idk( I don‚Äôt know) why though.:/  They just updated the chat box where you can‚Äôt chat but you use this button thingy and I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary  when you can just type it your self.

Whenever I load into free play or online my whole screen turns black, when I‚Äôm online it lasts longer but it still bothers me and I am not a patient child 2. QUICKCHAT IS THE WORST. when a meeting is called I just kind of wished I could actually skip it because whenever I want to say something I have to press the wheel go to all of the functions find what I need then out the name in it the place I was in and by 5e time I‚Äôm done with that the meeting is over and everyone suspects me it annoys me so much I just hate the quick chat, so please stop the quickchat. From now on anyone I meet who mentions among us I will tell them that I hate it and that they should not play it so until you fix the among us quickchat I will be saying among us is lame and that people should not play it. I used to love this game and played it every day but you will lose me and many of the people that I tell that among us is awful until you turn off quickchat because quickchat destroyed the whole theme of among us.

I have fond memories of playing with my friends and family, and it was always fun and random, so I could play up to an hour and not be bored. But, after the update, it wasn‚Äôt fun, and it was even kinda annoying. They created an account system, so if you don‚Äôt have an account, too bad. You can‚Äôt change your name to what you want, and instead go through random names like MeanCar and so on. That‚Äôs not so bad, but it gets worse. If you also don‚Äôt have an account, you can only talk with a horrible talk selections, which makes it hard to even talk. That may not be an issue in other games, but communicating with the players in this game is vital to find out whose the imposter, or other things like saying things like ‚Äú good game‚Äù and so on. Obviously, I wanted to make an account as soon as possible, but after I put in my birthday, it told me to enter my Apple ID, so I did, but it STILL didn‚Äôt let me create an account. I‚Äôve heard of some people who are just kids, and when they enter their birthday, it will ask the parents permission, but after that it asks the parent info about themselves, which is very annoying. I tried playing after this horrendous update, but for me, it‚Äôs impossible. I understand why Innersloth would do this, but this is as far away from a much better solution as they could get.

It made the game so much more fun and a lot easier to communicate when we were able to talk freely. I don‚Äôt know if that is just me or others but it was a bit frustrating when I was trying to say something and it was not working. I liked the way it was where if you were under a certain age you had to get permission because I have a little sister and sometimes something would happen that shouldn‚Äôt happen with her but for people like me, I would like to be able to talk freely again. If you could please fix that it would definitely make the game better. 

Also, I have played with some really fun people and would like to be able to play with them again so like if we could have like a friends thing and maybe you get like a notification when they are playing and what thing they are in.

The next thing i'd like to report is that when the imposter leaves in a meeting it won't automatically make the crewmates win, it will wait until the end of the meeting to crash everyone's game. The next thing is sabotaging bugs. The latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged O2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to -11. The next important bug is when you are quick chatting, you might vote someone without knowing. The second to last thing i would like to share is on a mobile device when you first load in it just has part of the o and ng in, probably trying to say among us but it only says ong. Finally, the game is great and all, but i think the quick chat feature kind of got the game to become less popular, because you can't say what you want to say, or people just spam their quick chat thing so even when you say no one will see it or even believe i

But there‚Äôs a big issue for people with lower end devices, like iPhone 6 and down, or IPad mini 2-3 and down. It‚Äôs the old devices which are struggling to enjoy Among Us. The reason why (which should be fairly obvious), is that it kicks you out whether you want to talk or trying to do a task. It‚Äôs very annoying when I try playing on my ipad, which is a IPad mini 2. So this game needs an update so that this game can truly support these old devices so that everyone can have a good time.

Hackers are the reason why people have bad days, they can end meetings quickly so they‚Äôre not caught, they can see the ghost chat, they can make people say that they‚Äôre impostor even thought they don‚Äôt want to. Though the host as the ability to kick, sometimes they just don‚Äôt, or the hacker is the host. I know it‚Äôs asking a lot from 3 devs who made this game by themselves, but we need a reporting button, so we can report these hackers and bring them to justice

Every day, he would watch it over and over and over again, laughing hysterically each time. He was so obsessed that he couldn't stop watching it, even when he needed to sleep or eat or just take a break. He was constantly glued to the screen, watching the Skibidi toilet with a huge grin on his face. It was the most entertaining thing in the world to him, and he couldn't get enough of it. No one knew why he loved it so much, but it was his favorite thing to do. 

The boy's obsession with the Skibidi toilet eventually lead to him being isolated from his peers. He was constantly mocked and bullied for being so weird and different, and he didn't understand why nobody else seemed to enjoy the Skibidi toilet as much as he did. But despite the ridicule and the isolation, the boy still couldn't shake his love for the Skibidi toilet. He continued to watch it every day, and he didn't care what anyone thought of him. It was more important to him than anything else in the world.

Among us allowed him to find creatures of his own kind and socialize with skibity sigmas around the world.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-11T18:34:46-07:00

But recently I‚Äôve seen this app having lots of problems. First of all when I tried to play a game it would just say the server is not working. All the time. There is nothing wrong with my WIFI and it has been working on this WIFI before. So it‚Äôs a bug in the game. Also, why does the game show servers that are full and have already started? This seems unnecessary and only a major inconvenience. This game shows incorrect number of players too. When I join a game with 4/15 players, it almost is full. Can you guys fix this too. I think this game needs some different mods of the game to make it less boring. 
For example, I think we need a Hide And Seek version of the game to make it more fun, sense a lot of people played this game. I‚Äôm almost done, but can you bring back the chats? I think just removing them is not the way to go. I think if someone is using in appropriate language, their account can be removed, so other people that deserve to use the chat can. And can we make our own names too? Again, people with inappropriate names can just have their account removed.

The second thing is this: sometimes people are wicked SMART so when you try to trick them they see right through the lie. Other times the people are so DUMB that it‚Äôs Wicked easy to win. For example one time I was playing and there was this person who said that I was the impsoter (which I wasn‚Äôt) and every body‚Äôs like ok let‚Äôs do what he says but so then somebody asks Proof?

Then one time I was playing and somebody said vote yellow i saw him vent and then somebody else is like How vote? And then the other person said: how long have you been playing this game and the person says 2 years. It‚Äôs like lol HOW can you NOT know how to vote after playing the game for 2 YEARS.

The first thing that was really annoying is that when you enter a game with the new map, I couldn‚Äôt say anything in the chat, and that is annoying because when people asked my a question, I couldn‚Äôt respond. Another glitch that happened was when I pressed the account button, and I pressed randomized name, when I tried to put a name in the box to to put a name that you wanted, it wouldn‚Äôt work so now I can‚Äôt change my name. The last glitch that happened was when I was in a room and the game was about to start, but for about a minute it was just a black screen until the game started. This isn‚Äôt a big of a deal for me, but before the game actually started, a lot of people would leave and then when the game actually started, there would only be a few people playing and the game would end really fast because there was only a few people playing.

But needs an update,"I love this game, but I also wanted to say that people have been playing a new version within the game that is also fun. They call it the hide and seek version. It‚Äôs not an actual update, but I think the creators could make it an update. Like have there be not only the different places, but another setting set up specially for the hide and seek version. Like have there be imposters, seekers, and one hider. The hider goes and hides some where, like in special areas. The seekers goal is to look for the hider, by doing tasks to open different areas around the ship where the hider could be hiding. The hider can transfer hiding spots like venting, but can‚Äôt go in the unlocked places that tasks have been done in. The imposters goal is to kill all the seekers. Imposters don‚Äôt vent from thing to thing, they vent from room to room. The goal of the imposter is basically the same: kill everyone and sabotage. The goal of the seekers: to find the hider, prevent sabotage, and unlock all the places. The hiders goal: is to hide throughout the entire game not getting caught. The hider can‚Äôt kill, but they can sabotage, as there goal is to win.

Also there are players that ruin the game for others like hackers, and people who are know it alls there should be a limit to how many times each individual person can call a meeting  in a row besides the limit the creator sets. I would say make it un-hackable but thats not a option there should be a way to report them for hacking that gets them banned or something like that so they know not to do it. A friend system would be cool so like players could play again. And the error that comes up when you pick a room is weird why be on the open room list if you cant join they should disappear without having to be refreshed when full. Again these are just opinions. But I would rate 5 stars if there was a way to report people at least. :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-17T00:20:04-07:00

I‚Äôm on an iOS device right now (iPad,) and I play Among Us on a regular basis. I used to just play the main map, (I forgot what it‚Äôs called üòÖ) but after some time of watching others playing in the other maps, I took an interest into them. The Polus map though, (I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the name of it but it got the red, orange, and yellow lava when you vote someone off and such) has a of task bug. It isn‚Äôt crazy, but it‚Äôs just that some tasks like the red screen task next to the lava near emergency room has a weird glitch where when I press ‚Äúuse‚Äù the game wouldn‚Äôt register it and the game wouldn‚Äôt let me even go into the task. All I‚Äôm saying through this review is that you should check that out. It‚Äôs that task I mentioned and another one I think near MedBay. It would be deeply appreciated if you could fix those bugs because I love that map and it‚Äôs probably my favorite one yet.

I have met lots of people and made so many new friends, but there are some things that I think are a nuisance. First off is the glitches and bugs. Yesterday I was playing the game and played a few games with a fellow player, and we really bonded and got to know each other. As I was typing in my personal information for the player I was booted out because of a glitch that said that I am playing Among Us on an older version. I was so sad and frustrated. A friend request would really help with that. I know the help team is currently working on it, and I will try to live with it until that feature comes out. Another thing is that maybe having the ability to private chat someone unless you are dead would be awesome, so that if you are willing to give your phone number or snap to someone they can only see it and not everyone in the whole game. I‚Äôm also really happy that there is a censor feature as some players curses can be quite offensive and vulgar at times.

I don‚Äôt recommend this game for Public play.

New Edit: The new Airship map is huge and amazing, also, they fixed the swearing part of the game, but it‚Äôs still a 4 Star Review because of the limited chat options. This really helps with the swearing like I said, but it takes away most of the feel for Among Us. Also, a lot of things I want to say are limited. Like, for example: one of the questions you can ask is if this is an emergency meeting or a dead body, but I haven‚Äôt seen a way to answer that question. In order to fix this, I feel that you should update the game to Blank out swear words. You could also expand the options of questions or let the players write their own and have the game allow or block this. As well as having the option to ban a player completely from the game if you could go through a couple games yourself and see who swears and ban them according.

Since my device is programmed so I might recommend fixing that. One recommendation is maybe doing similar to quick chat but the player can just enter the game make an account and play butttt no quick chat just make it so if anybody entry‚Äôs to say something inappropriate make it blocked or blurred like in Roblox which has the little X‚Äôs. And I know for most people u enter and make an account and they can sign in, but for people with screen restrictions it doesn‚Äôt work. U can‚Äôt sign in. And we are forced to used quick chat.

I have a few suggestions though. maybe you could put a button that for a few dollars (ex: 3.99) you would be able to actually do tasks as imposter so your not sus. i feel like the Imposter should also be able to be able to turn invisible instead of venting because everyone sees the vent and what if there not a vent around im just saying like you would be basically a ghost for like 5 seconds then u would hv to wait it would be like u hv to wait to kill. so those were my suggestions and comments. please try to do some of the suggestions. thank you for making this game!!!!!!!!! üòÄüòÄüòÑüòÑüòúüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

It‚Äôs fun to be a crewmate and even better to be imposter. The only problem is: The Players. Well some players are ok, a lot of them of just horrible. One of the most annoying people you will encounter are the emergency meeting people. These people call a meeting for NO reason. They will either call a meeting to accuse someone for no reason or call a meeting at the start of the game to say ‚Äúhi.‚Äù It‚Äôs just annoying that people waste time and it‚Äôs even worse when they don‚Äôt vote and the voting time is so long. Next is the people who don‚Äôt believe you even when you have a ridiculous amount of evidence. You see someone kill, vent, or run from a body and report it, it takes one word for people to convince others to vote for you. After then we have the people who leave. As soon as the game starts, as SOON AS THE GAME STARTS, people will leave because they are not the imposter. It‚Äôs annoying for the crewmates and the imposters because the game ends immediately. Just wait and you with be the imposter people. Is it that hard to WAIT?! Huh?! Anyway, just because almost EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT PLAYS THIS GAME IS THE ANNOYING, doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt play this.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

Then you have those troll hackers who toy with you before killing everyone in 1 sec. Or change everyone‚Äôs name to something weird or inappropriate. Honestly hackers are single handedly killing this game. I suggest making it so that hackers can‚Äôt hack into the game, more security, what ever works to get rid of these people.
2. Disconnecting, times where I click a lobby that could have 2 people and it say game full, ‚Äúgame started already‚Äù, or just straight up disconnects me.

I like the game but it‚Äôs honestly kind of getting boring now that I can‚Äôt say different things. The suggestions you put in there like ‚Äúyeet‚Äù- like where does that phrase even apply-

The point of the game is to (from a Crewmate‚Äôs point of view) catch impostors and win the game, and (from an Impostor‚Äôs point of view) to kill as many people as possible and win the game. This is probably why all those voice chat games for Among Us are getting popular, because we can‚Äôt even express ourselves, and apparently saying ‚Äúyeet‚Äù randomly is normal and not at all unrelated or unnecessary..?

But there is a problem, Some people play this game with inappropriate nicknames, like c*ckdaddy, c*msock, and etc. If there is a possible way to curse out the bad names and the bad people that say cuss words in the chat, that would be amazing. I would love to see more maps and colors, and hats,  For the season. Their are Halloween hats. But I don‚Äôt want those to replace with Christmas hats. There also should be more normal hats that the players can use. And maybe it would be really fun to add new roles, maybe one person is a nurse to help dead body‚Äôs but they have a limit that is in the game settings. There also should be new k*ll animations instead of neck twisting, g*n shooting. Also, It isn‚Äôt that good to let the parents pay for clothes, and mini crew mates. It isn‚Äôt that fair to the other players that are on the game and to the people who do have the stuff that you need to pay for. There should be more colors for people to choose on the computer in the among us game, like navy blue, grey, teal, magenta, violet, peach. If the among us developers could fix these problems I‚Äôve seen that would be great. And maybe you could add these suggestions.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-12T20:04:14-07:00

It is a very fun game for kids to play there is just one thing I wish would change! I get how people will curse on this game!!! Although I wish I child keep this game it just makes my parents uncomfortable with a game that allows you to curse. Could you please add to wear if you send a text that has a curse word it won‚Äôt send???? I really want to keep this game. Because it is not just that I don‚Äôt like curse words, kids will text at least 5 curse words in one chat!!! People are also being mean to there people on the app by cursing. I have had my little sister cry because people just aren‚Äôt nice with curse words. Also, I have had a lot of people who are asking you personal information, they would ask you where you live your phone number your name and your age it is just uncomfortable. Also people would be giving out their phone numbers for no reason. I just feel extremely uncomfortable with all the cursing. Please make it wear you can‚Äôt curse AT ALL. That would be way for better and then a lot of people wouldn‚Äôt be cursed at. Because there tons of people who that. Please respond!!!!

I play w8th my best friends in our group chat. However there are some suggestions I have. I was reading the other reviews and they came across the point that after killing someone having to Wait another 30 seconds is not needed. Cuz I can kill someone and then another player walks in right after I need to kill them so they don‚Äôt rat me out if that makes sense. The report button is another thing people be saying some WEIRD STUFF on that chat Ian even gone lie üòÇüòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but there should really be a report button.

I log on today and when I join a game it tells me ‚Äúkicked from - server name -‚Äù and I can‚Äôt play on my account anymore I literally put money on my credit card so I could buy an outfit on among us but instead I can‚Äôt play at all, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm banned or not but either way it‚Äôs not fare what‚Äôs so ever whenever I log out of my account I can play the game but when I log into my account I get kicked? Yeah ok buddy I love this game and the fact that I get banned is complete crap and I‚Äôm not playing this game ever again I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt spend my money before getting banned.. I give this once 10/10 game a low rating of 1-5 stars because of the developers lack of understanding I don‚Äôt cheat or hack so it‚Äôs completely unjust for my account to be banned without my knowledge, I‚Äôd love if my account was un-banned so I could play still but I‚Äôd rather have the developers leave it banned because it just proves how terrible these people are when it comes to developing a software that‚Äôll prevent hackers from playing,

FYI
whenever I play this game there is a 7-10 chance there will be a hacker in the game and I EXTREMELY DOUBT the developers do anything to ban them, I played this game almost everyday and they just ban my account just because I decided to play this morning.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-10T16:18:46-07:00

It was addicting and I loved playing with my friends! Now that this new update is there I am contemplating deleting the app. I don‚Äôt like the quick chat thing because it‚Äôs hard to find what you want to say, and when you do everyone has already voted. I also don‚Äôt like that because of this quick chat you can‚Äôt be like funny on the chat. I used to really like this because it would just be so funny to watch what people were saying. Now I kinda feel like I am in school and only aloud to be serious. Please bring back the normal chat pls!!! Another thing is that idk if it‚Äôs just me, but after either a dead body report, or a emergency meeting is called I can‚Äôt move. So when the game starts I have to hurry up and get my tasks done, or if I am the imposter I have to go fast and kill people. Also I am sorry but the new map is just dumb and confusing. I know you don‚Äôt have to play on that one, but when I tried I had no clue where I was going, and I felt like I was learning how to play all over again. Probably the only thing I like about this update are the new free hats. Just so the company knows I am being nice on the rating, so please fix this because let‚Äôs be honest no one is going to continue to play unless this gets fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-10T06:42:23-07:00

If your looking to buy this game you should totally get it. Here are my suggestions. When I play games a meet a lot of nice people and we start becoming friends. But when I leave I can‚Äôt see them again, so I want to get a friends list. It would be fun to friend people and it would be more easy to join them. I would also like you to let us have more room for our name. Cause it wont let me make my name long and it make me sad. Cause i have some names that are long, but i cant type it cause i dont have anough room for my name. I think it would be cool to let imposters to see ghost chat or make it a in game purchase, so imposters can see ghost chat. Another suggestion, you dont have to do this,  but i think it wouls be cute if people could adopt pets who's owner's have died. I think it would be fun to have a new role or map. The new role could be detective or what ever your idea is. A new map could be like a new planet or somthing. Last I think we could get more clothing. It would be so fun to dress up your pets too! The ones in the game are amazing but i think adding more would be fun. :3

8035038017,ReviewMaster24,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1196428734,2021.11.10,5,New Update is AWESOME! Huge thanks to the devs!!!,"Okay, so when this game came out, it was fun because it was a new concept, and was extremely fun. But the game got old. After a while, I found myself playing less and less. And the new update only pushed me further away. But the current update drew me back in, and I. AM. HOOKED. The new leveling up system makes the game so much more engaging, and the optional micro transactions are reasonable. The new roles make the game feel fresh and takes away the likelihood that you are just going to be walking around doing tasks as a normal crew mate. The roles also add a bunch of new strategies for impostors and crew mates alike. One annoying thing is that the game doesn‚Äôt play well on cellular data, but that is a reasonable thing that happens. Keep going guys, thanks so much!!!

One last thing for the devs‚Ä¶ I have a suggestion (if you ever read this) for a new role. It would be cool if there was a role where players had walkie talkies, and they had like a 45 second cool down where people could privately chat without a meeting being called. Again, thanks so much for working so hard on this amazingly fun yet simplistic game!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-17T15:56:45-07:00
7172927203,Joe Forkez,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1274796444,2021.3.31.2,3,It was good until the update.,"Among Us was good until the recent update. Now I can't type anything useful along with all of the other players. Nobody talks and it's hard to chat. For something like a gaming console it looks good, but on mobile and PC it is not. I can type A Lot faster than I can navigate through the new chat system. From a strategic standpoint, I used to be able to make a convincing story of someone else doing the killing instead of me. If I was a crewmate, I could defend myself from accusations or take the offense on someone who is sus. Now all I can say is, ""He is sus,"" or, ""Body in Reactor."" It takes a while to go through the new thing and I can't even say which colors, which is what most people say. If this is supposed to keep kids safe from the internet then what about the censor chat feature? It keeps the language out while still letting people actually talk. Anybody under the age of 10 should have Quick Chat. I don't think that teenagers should be stick with this also. Literally as a 16 year old I find it really annoying that I can't chat as easily and fast as I used to be able to. Among Us has already lost some of its popularity; this move will only accelerate the trend. Players can't have anywhere close to as much fun as they used to be able to.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-01T18:22:43-07:00

Why it‚Äôs A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you ‚Äú the among us savers ‚Äú are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can‚Äôt say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this ‚Äúwell we also have it we‚Äôre if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say ‚Äú and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of ‚Äúspeech‚Äù would most likely not like this but then again I‚Äôm not them. If you feel like I‚Äôm wrong then I‚Äôm wrong if you feel like I‚Äôm right then I‚Äôm right but I‚Äôm just shooting out there that this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù might or should I say will effect this games success in a good way or bad way and if it does effect it in a bad way then at least you would know why.

I really do recommend it! It‚Äôs really fun to play with friends and family:) although I do have some recommendations! I feel like we should not pay for pets hats or clothing because I feel like it‚Äôs very unnecessary! Instead of having to buy them I think there should be like a daily mystery wheel where you can win items or maybe every time you win a game you get coins and are able to buy items with them? I also think that there should be a report button for everyone even if they aren‚Äôt dead just in case they are being inappropriate! I also think we shouldn‚Äôt be able to say bad words because some people take advantage of that and start being inappropriate :( I also think there should be a setting where you are able to add friends so you can play with crew mates again! Although this game is amazing! I really do recommend it! Edit: not sure what this is but for some reason some of the hats have been removed for example I was trying to wear the devil hat and it was not there in the inventory and I know the hat wasn‚Äôt removed because someone else was also wearing it so I‚Äôm not sure if this is some type of bug!),https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-29T00:19:44-07:00
