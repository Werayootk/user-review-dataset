The crew mates job is to finish their tasks before the impostor wins. The impostors job is to kill all the crew mates before the crew mates win. You can also report body’s and call emergency meeting to discuss who is sus(suspicious.)  There is a chat box to discuss. If you see someone vent or kill you can report the body if you can go to the body or if you see them vent or kill run to the emergency meeting button.(if they vent or kill they are the impostor, there can be one, two, or three impostors.) you can host a game so you can create a game or you can join a game. But sometimes the game that you choose they may have already started and you may have to join a different one. The one weird thing is the host or if you host a game you can ban some people idk( I don’t know) why though.:/  They just updated the chat box where you can’t chat but you use this button thingy and I don’t really think it’s necessary  when you can just type it your self. So to the people who create this can you please change it back to how it was please and thank you. Thank you too all the people who have read all of this, I hope this helped!❤️bye❤️",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-24T09:55:21-07:00

Whenever I load into free play or online my whole screen turns black, when I’m online it lasts longer but it still bothers me and I am not a patient child 2. QUICKCHAT IS THE WORST. when a meeting is called I just kind of wished I could actually skip it because whenever I want to say something I have to press the wheel go to all of the functions find what I need then out the name in it the place I was in and by 5e time I’m done with that the meeting is over and everyone suspects me it annoys me so much I just hate the quick chat, so please stop the quickchat. From now on anyone I meet who mentions among us I will tell them that I hate it and that they should not play it so until you fix the among us quickchat I will be saying among us is lame and that people should not play it. I used to love this game and played it every day but you will lose me and many of the people that I tell that among us is awful until you turn off quickchat because quickchat destroyed the whole theme of among us.

I have fond memories of playing with my friends and family, and it was always fun and random, so I could play up to an hour and not be bored. But, after the update, it wasn’t fun, and it was even kinda annoying. They created an account system, so if you don’t have an account, too bad. You can’t change your name to what you want, and instead go through random names like MeanCar and so on. That’s not so bad, but it gets worse. If you also don’t have an account, you can only talk with a horrible talk selections, which makes it hard to even talk. That may not be an issue in other games, but communicating with the players in this game is vital to find out whose the imposter, or other things like saying things like “ good game” and so on. Obviously, I wanted to make an account as soon as possible, but after I put in my birthday, it told me to enter my Apple ID, so I did, but it STILL didn’t let me create an account. I’ve heard of some people who are just kids, and when they enter their birthday, it will ask the parents permission, but after that it asks the parent info about themselves, which is very annoying. I tried playing after this horrendous update, but for me, it’s impossible. I understand why Innersloth would do this, but this is as far away from a much better solution as they could get.
Sorry for the long review, I had a lot to say :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-09T10:08:36-07:00

It made the game so much more fun and a lot easier to communicate when we were able to talk freely. I don’t know if that is just me or others but it was a bit frustrating when I was trying to say something and it was not working. I liked the way it was where if you were under a certain age you had to get permission because I have a little sister and sometimes something would happen that shouldn’t happen with her but for people like me, I would like to be able to talk freely again. If you could please fix that it would definitely make the game better. 

Also, I have played with some really fun people and would like to be able to play with them again so like if we could have like a friends thing and maybe you get like a notification when they are playing and what thing they are in. As long as it’s not private. And even like a playing request if it is a private game so that you could still invite them that would also make the game a lot better.

The next thing i'd like to report is that when the imposter leaves in a meeting it won't automatically make the crewmates win, it will wait until the end of the meeting to crash everyone's game. The next thing is sabotaging bugs. The latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged O2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to -11. The next important bug is when you are quick chatting, you might vote someone without knowing. The second to last thing i would like to share is on a mobile device when you first load in it just has part of the o and ng in, probably trying to say among us but it only says ong. Finally, the game is great and all, but i think the quick chat feature kind of got the game to become less popular, because you can't say what you want to say, or people just spam their quick chat thing so even when you say no one will see it or even believe i
t! You can't even say hi or talk about the latest game! Heck you can't even say gg! Are we even going to talk about when you try to join the game it says ""the game is full"" when it only showed 2 people in it!

Any ways I played and like the third meeting they voted the other imposter out and right before they left they said “I am a virus that you can never get rid of, I will alway be here” so obviously that was a little unnerving but I kept playing because I just thought they were trying to freak me out, i ended up winning and when I was waiting for the next game to start the second imposter started talking again about how they are a virus that can’t be fixed. I got freaked out and left the game, mind you I like never get imposter 90% of the time I am crew mate but every game I joined after that I got imposter, and if I stayed in that same game I would repeatedly get imposter, so idk if I actually got a virus or if it is just dumb luck or whatever you want to call that but recently there have been a lot more hackers like that that I think are just trying to freak people out.

But there’s a big issue for people with lower end devices, like iPhone 6 and down, or IPad mini 2-3 and down. It’s the old devices which are struggling to enjoy Among Us. The reason why (which should be fairly obvious), is that it kicks you out whether you want to talk or trying to do a task. It’s very annoying when I try playing on my ipad, which is a IPad mini 2. So this game needs an update so that this game can truly support these old devices so that everyone can have a good time.

Hackers are the reason why people have bad days, they can end meetings quickly so they’re not caught, they can see the ghost chat, they can make people say that they’re impostor even thought they don’t want to. Though the host as the ability to kick, sometimes they just don’t, or the hacker is the host. I know it’s asking a lot from 3 devs who made this game by themselves, but we need a reporting button, so we can report these hackers and bring them to justice

Every day, he would watch it over and over and over again, laughing hysterically each time. He was so obsessed that he couldn't stop watching it, even when he needed to sleep or eat or just take a break. He was constantly glued to the screen, watching the Skibidi toilet with a huge grin on his face. It was the most entertaining thing in the world to him, and he couldn't get enough of it. No one knew why he loved it so much, but it was his favorite thing to do. 

The boy's obsession with the Skibidi toilet eventually lead to him being isolated from his peers. He was constantly mocked and bullied for being so weird and different, and he didn't understand why nobody else seemed to enjoy the Skibidi toilet as much as he did. But despite the ridicule and the isolation, the boy still couldn't shake his love for the Skibidi toilet. He continued to watch it every day, and he didn't care what anyone thought of him. It was more important to him than anything else in the world.

Among us allowed him to find creatures of his own kind and socialize with skibity sigmas around the world.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-11T18:34:46-07:00

Like one of the tasks could be steering the ship...I don’t know but I thought that would be fun. Do whatever! I also love the additional abilities for the impostor! (Venting, Sabotages, still have the ability to Report and call Emergency Meetings) I have no down-hills for this game accept one thing. I do appreciate the censoring on the chat, but it’s kind of hard to communicate with the new update where you have a limited selection of phrases and statements, etc. I’m not asking you to take the update away, (I don’t want to make anything difficult for you!) Just saying it’s a little tough to talk accordingly with others and to discuss our thoughts to locate the impostor. Other than that, I love it! Thank you! (It’s amazing!)

But recently I’ve seen this app having lots of problems. First of all when I tried to play a game it would just say the server is not working. All the time. There is nothing wrong with my WIFI and it has been working on this WIFI before. So it’s a bug in the game. Also, why does the game show servers that are full and have already started? This seems unnecessary and only a major inconvenience. This game shows incorrect number of players too. When I join a game with 4/15 players, it almost is full. Can you guys fix this too. I think this game needs some different mods of the game to make it less boring. 
For example, I think we need a Hide And Seek version of the game to make it more fun, sense a lot of people played this game. I’m almost done, but can you bring back the chats? I think just removing them is not the way to go. I think if someone is using in appropriate language, their account can be removed, so other people that deserve to use the chat can. And can we make our own names too? Again, people with inappropriate names can just have their account removed.

And lobby screen is just a black screen that’s there for like 10 seconds before I can play i do know how to resolve the free typing issue you just sign in but what about people who don’t have an account or the other people who don’t type freely like them just makes logging in a big hassle with no reward so they don’t use the free typing. And don’t get me started on usernames you still have to log in for literally ANY typing things and the nicknames are randomized in 2 half’s but still there’s so many people who can’t type because they don’t know how or do but since no one else is typing it just isn’t worth tooth new update I personally like the old among us.

I’ll start off by saying this is a great game and I have never run into hackers. The second thing is this: sometimes people are wicked SMART so when you try to trick them they see right through the lie. Other times the people are so DUMB that it’s Wicked easy to win. For example one time I was playing and there was this person who said that I was the impsoter (which I wasn’t) and every body’s like ok let’s do what he says but so then somebody asks Proof? And the person is like I saw them in cafeteria. And they’re like “doing WHAT?” And the guys like : nothing. So then everybody votes the guy who said it’s me and he’s the imposter. Then one time I was playing and somebody said vote yellow i saw him vent and then somebody else is like How vote? And then the other person said: how long have you been playing this game and the person says 2 years. It’s like lol HOW can you NOT know how to vote after playing the game for 2 YEARS. But so back to the point, this is the best game ever. I have never seen a game like this and probably never will. I won’t ask you guys to add anything else because I know the game is fragile and adding anything else could break the whole game.

This game has an exiting plot and some bugs are fixed according to the updates👍. It is pretty violent, with the killing and all but if that was changed it wouldn’t be among us anymore. The updates have made the game even better! it is super addicting. But there’s a REALLY big problem... Cyberbullying.😒 I was cyber bullied twice and the first time wasn’t bad but the second one i thought white was sus, and I said it in the chat. and he turned out not to be impostor and in the next game he said to me, “****” “Dumb ***” “Stupid” and of course I reported him, but people with quick chat can easily cyber bully and reporting didn’t REALLY fix it. After that my parents banned me from among us unless I am playing on freeplay. So I think that there should be an option of what type of chat is in the game, like two options where one is to only play online with people who have the chat where you select what you want to say, not type it. The other option could be where you only play with people who have quick chat. Please add this to one of the updates.

That’s why it’s 4 stars. The first thing that was really annoying is that when you enter a game with the new map, I couldn’t say anything in the chat, and that is annoying because when people asked my a question, I couldn’t respond. Another glitch that happened was when I pressed the account button, and I pressed randomized name, when I tried to put a name in the box to to put a name that you wanted, it wouldn’t work so now I can’t change my name. The last glitch that happened was when I was in a room and the game was about to start, but for about a minute it was just a black screen until the game started. This isn’t a big of a deal for me, but before the game actually started, a lot of people would leave and then when the game actually started, there would only be a few people playing and the game would end really fast because there was only a few people playing.

But needs an update,"I love this game, but I also wanted to say that people have been playing a new version within the game that is also fun. They call it the hide and seek version. It’s not an actual update, but I think the creators could make it an update. Like have there be not only the different places, but another setting set up specially for the hide and seek version. Like have there be imposters, seekers, and one hider. The hider goes and hides some where, like in special areas. The seekers goal is to look for the hider, by doing tasks to open different areas around the ship where the hider could be hiding. The hider can transfer hiding spots like venting, but can’t go in the unlocked places that tasks have been done in. The imposters goal is to kill all the seekers. Imposters don’t vent from thing to thing, they vent from room to room. The goal of the imposter is basically the same: kill everyone and sabotage. The goal of the seekers: to find the hider, prevent sabotage, and unlock all the places. The hiders goal: is to hide throughout the entire game not getting caught. The hider can’t kill, but they can sabotage, as there goal is to win.
I hope you consider this idea for an update!

There should also be options for more members to join the game if people disconnect in the being beginning because of connection issues. I love the game and its addictive but these options would help make the game fuller and less crappy for children that play. It would be fun to have a “hidden vote” option for each individual player to choose so no one can see who they vote for. Also there are players that ruin the game for others like hackers, and people who are know it alls there should be a limit to how many times each individual person can call a meeting  in a row besides the limit the creator sets. I would say make it un-hackable but thats not a option there should be a way to report them for hacking that gets them banned or something like that so they know not to do it. A friend system would be cool so like players could play again.

I’m on an iOS device right now (iPad,) and I play Among Us on a regular basis. I used to just play the main map, (I forgot what it’s called 😅) but after some time of watching others playing in the other maps, I took an interest into them. The Polus map though, (I don’t know if that’s the name of it but it got the red, orange, and yellow lava when you vote someone off and such) has a of task bug. It isn’t crazy, but it’s just that some tasks like the red screen task next to the lava near emergency room has a weird glitch where when I press “use” the game wouldn’t register it and the game wouldn’t let me even go into the task. All I’m saying through this review is that you should check that out. It’s that task I mentioned and another one I think near MedBay. It would be deeply appreciated if you could fix those bugs because I love that map and it’s probably my favorite one yet. Other than that, thanks for making such a great game, and as another request, I would love to see the limited hat with the lights for Christmas. Would make my day to see it again. 🙏",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-15T15:56:16-07:00

I have met lots of people and made so many new friends, but there are some things that I think are a nuisance. First off is the glitches and bugs. Yesterday I was playing the game and played a few games with a fellow player, and we really bonded and got to know each other. As I was typing in my personal information for the player I was booted out because of a glitch that said that I am playing Among Us on an older version. I was so sad and frustrated. A friend request would really help with that. I know the help team is currently working on it, and I will try to live with it until that feature comes out. Another thing is that maybe having the ability to private chat someone unless you are dead would be awesome, so that if you are willing to give your phone number or snap to someone they can only see it and not everyone in the whole game. I’m also really happy that there is a censor feature as some players curses can be quite offensive and vulgar at times.

I know there’s probably nothing to do because people can just lie about their age to get free chat but still if there’s anything please fix that i don't even know how much people with that name I’ve reported or tried to before getting kicked or banned from that lobby. But overall its a good game besides that just hate seeing so many lobby's with that name and sorry this was so long but i feel like that just had to come out also i know some people might not have a problem with that but kids might be playing this with free chat and seeing that is just bad for them.

But, there’s just one thing that really annoys me..updates. Like, whenever u update the game, like for example, the new April fools update that’s going on right now, it’s just kinda annoying to me, and I don’t like the updates, at all. I show my friends the new updates bc they haven’t seen it yet, and they r like, “what?! This is just so confusing, I don’t like this new update, it’s annoying!”  So they try the game out and that’s what they say about the all the new crazy updates u do to this game. I mean, some updates I like, but some is annoying to me. I also really think that u should not make really crazy updates to this game. I’m not trying to say that u shouldn’t update the game, I’m just trying to say that u shouldn’t make updates that r annoying. I’m also not trying to be mean, I’m just saying there is a problem.

The game also try’s to prevent this, but people get through this very small obstacle. Also, if you care, they take the lord’s name in vein. A LOT. Otherwise though, this is a great game! I don’t recommend this game for Public play.

New Edit: The new Airship map is huge and amazing, also, they fixed the swearing part of the game, but it’s still a 4 Star Review because of the limited chat options. This really helps with the swearing like I said, but it takes away most of the feel for Among Us. Also, a lot of things I want to say are limited. Like, for example: one of the questions you can ask is if this is an emergency meeting or a dead body, but I haven’t seen a way to answer that question. In order to fix this, I feel that you should update the game to Blank out swear words. You could also expand the options of questions or let the players write their own and have the game allow or block this. As well as having the option to ban a player completely from the game if you could go through a couple games yourself and see who swears and ban them according. Also, I’m stuck with a random name and I can’t change it. I’m stuck with Dullshape now. 🙁",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-06T13:30:50-07:00

Now don’t get me wrong I love your game but that update has to make some changes. I have made a discovery if you want to have free chat then here me out DELETE Among us and then redownlod it and when it asked u your age put the year all the way down to 2004 then do everything else whatever u want then go into a public match and u will be able to type. Ohh also I played a match of Among us before I went to school and I came across a HACKER I was the imposter so that made it worse I’ll set the stage . I was the imposter and there was 10 people everything was going smooth until Somone reported the body that I just murdered . Purple (the hacker) said that it was me without any proof and plus there were nobody on cams and he wasn’t near me at all Every one believed some how and voted me off I got so ANGRY and hear me out I think you should have a report button and not the one with the bodies and stuff like where u can actully report a player who is hacking .Thank you for your time,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-13T09:52:39-07:00

It’s the mix of kinda Detective work with adventure and fun. You can connect with your friends and make some. There are a lot of maps to play in. I did take a break from playing for a few months, when I came back it made me update it and I did. Well, the update needs improvement . I don’t like quick chat it is a lot safer but for me I have screen restrictions and time limits on my device so when it ask me to log in so I can use free chat it’s doesn’t let me my parent tried it still doesn’t work. Since my device is programmed so I might recommend fixing that. One recommendation is maybe doing similar to quick chat but the player can just enter the game make an account and play butttt no quick chat just make it so if anybody entry’s to say something inappropriate make it blocked or blurred like in Roblox which has the little X’s. And I know for most people u enter and make an account and they can sign in, but for people with screen restrictions it doesn’t work. U can’t sign in. And we are forced to used quick chat.

I have a few suggestions though. maybe you could put a button that for a few dollars (ex: 3.99) you would be able to actually do tasks as imposter so your not sus. i feel like the Imposter should also be able to be able to turn invisible instead of venting because everyone sees the vent and what if there not a vent around im just saying like you would be basically a ghost for like 5 seconds then u would hv to wait it would be like u hv to wait to kill. so those were my suggestions and comments. please try to do some of the suggestions. thank you for making this game!!!!!!!!! 😀😀😄😄😜👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

The only problem is: The Players. Well some players are ok, a lot of them of just horrible. One of the most annoying people you will encounter are the emergency meeting people. These people call a meeting for NO reason. They will either call a meeting to accuse someone for no reason or call a meeting at the start of the game to say “hi.” It’s just annoying that people waste time and it’s even worse when they don’t vote and the voting time is so long. Next is the people who don’t believe you even when you have a ridiculous amount of evidence. You see someone kill, vent, or run from a body and report it, it takes one word for people to convince others to vote for you. After then we have the people who leave. As soon as the game starts, as SOON AS THE GAME STARTS, people will leave because they are not the imposter. It’s annoying for the crewmates and the imposters because the game ends immediately. Just wait and you with be the imposter people. Is it that hard to WAIT?! Huh?! Anyway, just because almost EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT PLAYS THIS GAME IS THE ANNOYING, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play this. It is a fun game to play if you ignore all the other people.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-05T19:08:21-07:00

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-11T13:42:11-07:00

I started playing it about a day ago since everyone on the Internet was raving about it. I had to check it out so I downloaded it. When I first entered the game it took about 14 seconds for it to load. It’s kind of annoying because I expect a lot from games that are rated so high. But anyways I joined a game and started playing in a match. The game lasted about five minutes, but then it showed a black screen and kicked me out of the app. This happens multiple times when I join an online match. It’s quite annoying. Whenever I join a game, after about a couple minutes it boots me out and the game says that I “left”. If you could please fix this bug, it’d be very much appreciated because it would help the game a lot more. I hate how it kicks me out and I was never able to finish a match once. Other than that I think that this app is very good and I recommend it to people of all ages. I like that you can censor out the chat, if someone says anything inappropriate.

Another thing, i don’t really get the reason for having to put your card information in because i’m a teenager (old enough to play) but i don’t have a card nor account. i just want to be able to play with my own name as werg (i don’t see a problem with “werg”) and being able to chat without having to look for where every word is. the quick chat is too complex, in my opinion, and my friends agree too. and at times, we can’t call so we need the chat.

They were using racist slurs, and saying racist things like: the imposter is always black or brown, black was trying to rob me. Stuff like that.  I left the game before they could vote me off.

1. You guessed it: Hackers, These people are super annoying and upright disrespectful and just infuriating. I mean there where many games where I would be playing enjoying the game then a hacker decides to bomb the game and cheat making it impossible to play against. Then you have those troll hackers who toy with you before killing everyone in 1 sec. Or change everyone’s name to something weird or inappropriate. Honestly hackers are single handedly killing this game. I suggest making it so that hackers can’t hack into the game, more security, what ever works to get rid of these people.
2. Disconnecting, times where I click a lobby that could have 2 people and it say game full, “game started already”, or just straight up disconnects me. It’s gotten a bit better I will say but still slightly annoying. Or times where I’m in the middle of a task or running then disconnects. This ones a bit more minor then #1 but still an honorable mention. There are some other honorable mentions such as really rude people but honestly I understand that that’s just with any online game.

But that new feature in the update where you have to fill in an entire prompt? Yeah... that’s gotta be fixed. I understand that people have treated this game like a dating site or cyber bullying but there has to be another solution. It takes me forever to find what I want to say, find the name of the potential impostor/imposter (I don’t even know-) and then fill out an entire prompt. This actually happened earlier today and I barely got to finish what I wanted to say, because voting was over. I like the game but it’s honestly kind of getting boring now that I can’t say different things. The suggestions you put in there like “yeet”- like where does that phrase even apply-

The point of the game is to (from a Crewmate’s point of view) catch impostors and win the game, and (from an Impostor’s point of view) to kill as many people as possible and win the game. This is probably why all those voice chat games for Among Us are getting popular, because we can’t even express ourselves, and apparently saying “yeet” randomly is normal and not at all unrelated or unnecessary..?

I don’t know how I’m really supposed to play when all that is said is player names and “lies” or “no” or “idk”. I hope that the devs at least allow for people to change whether or not to have chat wheels in the game, as I could see that helping with the progress of the game even further, with new ideas coming into play like how people thought of hide n seek for it. At the very least, I think that if the devs want the game to come back, because I know a lot of people will leave it because of this, then they should work on ways of allowing people to have they freedom or not with the chat. Inner sloth, if you read this, thanks for all the hard work you have put into among us, and I’m really glad to have played it, but please consider this change that I know others would want along with me.

I would love to see more maps and colors, and hats,  For the season. Their are Halloween hats. But I don’t want those to replace with Christmas hats. There also should be more normal hats that the players can use. And maybe it would be really fun to add new roles, maybe one person is a nurse to help dead body’s but they have a limit that is in the game settings. There also should be new k*ll animations instead of neck twisting, g*n shooting. Also, It isn’t that good to let the parents pay for clothes, and mini crew mates. It isn’t that fair to the other players that are on the game and to the people who do have the stuff that you need to pay for. There should be more colors for people to choose on the computer in the among us game, like navy blue, grey, teal, magenta, violet, peach.

It is a very fun game for kids to play there is just one thing I wish would change! I get how people will curse on this game!!! Although I wish I child keep this game it just makes my parents uncomfortable with a game that allows you to curse. Could you please add to wear if you send a text that has a curse word it won’t send???? I really want to keep this game. Because it is not just that I don’t like curse words, kids will text at least 5 curse words in one chat!!! People are also being mean to there people on the app by cursing. I have had my little sister cry because people just aren’t nice with curse words. Also, I have had a lot of people who are asking you personal information, they would ask you where you live your phone number your name and your age it is just uncomfortable. Also people would be giving out their phone numbers for no reason. I just feel extremely uncomfortable with all the cursing. Please make it wear you can’t curse AT ALL. That would be way for better and then a lot of people wouldn’t be cursed at. Because there tons of people who that. Please respond!!!! This is still my face app!!!❤️",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-07T17:37:42-07:00

I’m always playing it. I thought my mom how to play my home room teacher how to play and some of my friends. I play with my bf and brother and their friends. I play w8th my best friends in our group chat. However there are some suggestions I have. I was reading the other reviews and they came across the point that after killing someone having to Wait another 30 seconds is not needed. Cuz I can kill someone and then another player walks in right after I need to kill them so they don’t rat me out if that makes sense. The report button is another thing people be saying some WEIRD STUFF on that chat Ian even gone lie 😂😂😂🤦‍♀️ but there should really be a report button. Also to make things fair when we play with our friends. All of our friends want to play at once I know this is asking for a lot but I hate to leave people out because there is 10/10 people playing already, I’m just asking for a few more slots. I think that’s it for now but if there is anything else I’ll let you guys know. But thanks for taking your time to read this review. 😇😇😌👌",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-13T03:01:06-07:00

I log on today and when I join a game it tells me “kicked from - server name -” and I can’t play on my account anymore I literally put money on my credit card so I could buy an outfit on among us but instead I can’t play at all, I’m not sure if I’m banned or not but either way it’s not fare what’s so ever whenever I log out of my account I can play the game but when I log into my account I get kicked? Yeah ok buddy I love this game and the fact that I get banned is complete crap and I’m not playing this game ever again I’m glad I didn’t spend my money before getting banned.. I give this once 10/10 game a low rating of 1-5 stars because of the developers lack of understanding I don’t cheat or hack so it’s completely unjust for my account to be banned without my knowledge, I’d love if my account was un-banned so I could play still but I’d rather have the developers leave it banned because it just proves how terrible these people are when it comes to developing a software that’ll prevent hackers from playing,

FYI
whenever I play this game there is a 7-10 chance there will be a hacker in the game and I EXTREMELY DOUBT the developers do anything to ban them, I played this game almost everyday and they just ban my account just because I decided to play this morning.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-10T16:18:46-07:00

Now that this new update is there I am contemplating deleting the app. I don’t like the quick chat thing because it’s hard to find what you want to say, and when you do everyone has already voted. I also don’t like that because of this quick chat you can’t be like funny on the chat. I used to really like this because it would just be so funny to watch what people were saying. Now I kinda feel like I am in school and only aloud to be serious. Please bring back the normal chat pls!!! Another thing is that idk if it’s just me, but after either a dead body report, or a emergency meeting is called I can’t move. So when the game starts I have to hurry up and get my tasks done, or if I am the imposter I have to go fast and kill people. Also I am sorry but the new map is just dumb and confusing. I know you don’t have to play on that one, but when I tried I had no clue where I was going, and I felt like I was learning how to play all over again. Probably the only thing I like about this update are the new free hats. Just so the company knows I am being nice on the rating, so please fix this because let’s be honest no one is going to continue to play unless this gets fixed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-10T06:42:23-07:00

6553386664,XxCheetoxX,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1217001220,2020.9.9,5,Amazing game! Few suggestions,"This is a really amazing game and I love playing with friends. If your looking to buy this game you should totally get it. Here are my suggestions. When I play games a meet a lot of nice people and we start becoming friends. But when I leave I can’t see them again, so I want to get a friends list. It would be fun to friend people and it would be more easy to join them. I would also like you to let us have more room for our name. Cause it wont let me make my name long and it make me sad. Cause i have some names that are long, but i cant type it cause i dont have anough room for my name. I think it would be cool to let imposters to see ghost chat or make it a in game purchase, so imposters can see ghost chat. Another suggestion, you dont have to do this,  but i think it wouls be cute if people could adopt pets who's owner's have died. I think it would be fun to have a new role or map. The new role could be detective or what ever your idea is. A new map could be like a new planet or somthing. Last I think we could get more clothing. It would be so fun to dress up your pets too! The ones in the game are amazing but i think adding more would be fun. :3

Thx bye! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-19T19:00:56-07:00
8035038017,ReviewMaster24,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1196428734,2021.11.10,5,New Update is AWESOME! Huge thanks to the devs!!!,"Okay, so when this game came out, it was fun because it was a new concept, and was extremely fun. But the game got old. After a while, I found myself playing less and less. And the new update only pushed me further away. But the current update drew me back in, and I. AM. HOOKED. The new leveling up system makes the game so much more engaging, and the optional micro transactions are reasonable. The new roles make the game feel fresh and takes away the likelihood that you are just going to be walking around doing tasks as a normal crew mate. The roles also add a bunch of new strategies for impostors and crew mates alike. One annoying thing is that the game doesn’t play well on cellular data, but that is a reasonable thing that happens. Keep going guys, thanks so much!!!

One last thing for the devs… I have a suggestion (if you ever read this) for a new role. It would be cool if there was a role where players had walkie talkies, and they had like a 45 second cool down where people could privately chat without a meeting being called. Again, thanks so much for working so hard on this amazingly fun yet simplistic game!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-17T15:56:45-07:00
7172927203,Joe Forkez,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1274796444,2021.3.31.2,3,It was good until the update.,"Among Us was good until the recent update. Now I can't type anything useful along with all of the other players. Nobody talks and it's hard to chat. For something like a gaming console it looks good, but on mobile and PC it is not. I can type A Lot faster than I can navigate through the new chat system. From a strategic standpoint, I used to be able to make a convincing story of someone else doing the killing instead of me. If I was a crewmate, I could defend myself from accusations or take the offense on someone who is sus. Now all I can say is, ""He is sus,"" or, ""Body in Reactor."" It takes a while to go through the new thing and I can't even say which colors, which is what most people say. If this is supposed to keep kids safe from the internet then what about the censor chat feature? It keeps the language out while still letting people actually talk. Anybody under the age of 10 should have Quick Chat. I don't think that teenagers should be stick with this also. Literally as a 16 year old I find it really annoying that I can't chat as easily and fast as I used to be able to. Among Us has already lost some of its popularity; this move will only accelerate the trend. Players can't have anywhere close to as much fun as they used to be able to.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-01T18:22:43-07:00
7073319942,alexander memto,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id739828557,2021.2.21,1,Why I hate this new update,"Among us, it’s a fun game that people of all ages love but this new update is annoying. Why it’s A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you “ the among us savers “ are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can’t say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this “well we also have it we’re if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say “ and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of “speech” would most likely not like this but then again I’m not them. If you feel like I’m wrong then I’m wrong if you feel like I’m right then I’m right but I’m just shooting out there that this “update” might or should I say will effect this games success in a good way or bad way and if it does effect it in a bad way then at least you would know why. Thank you for reading this and I love the among us community and the people in it and the game I’m just hoping you would listen to what I have to say thank you and good bye.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-06T13:21:49-07:00
6805935905,Debby ryan 😏,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1055838825,2020.11.17,4,This game is amazing but could use some changes,This game is the best game of the year! I really do recommend it! It’s really fun to play with friends and family:) although I do have some recommendations! I feel like we should not pay for pets hats or clothing because I feel like it’s very unnecessary! Instead of having to buy them I think there should be like a daily mystery wheel where you can win items or maybe every time you win a game you get coins and are able to buy items with them? I also think that there should be a report button for everyone even if they aren’t dead just in case they are being inappropriate! I also think we shouldn’t be able to say bad words because some people take advantage of that and start being inappropriate :( I also think there should be a setting where you are able to add friends so you can play with crew mates again! Although this game is amazing! I really do recommend it! Edit: not sure what this is but for some reason some of the hats have been removed for example I was trying to wear the devil hat and it was not there in the inventory and I know the hat wasn’t removed because someone else was also wearing it so I’m not sure if this is some type of bug!),https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-29T00:19:44-07:00
