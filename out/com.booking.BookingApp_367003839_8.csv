The pricing was just right, which is always a plus. The front desk gentleman and the entire staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home. 

As a California native, I appreciated the relaxed and casual vibe throughout my stay. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to unwind and explore the city. The room is a little dated in terms of design, but considering the price, it exceeds expectations in terms of amenities. 

The only other random random observation, there was no fridge or a microwave. It definitely wasn't a big deal sincee I only realized it halfway through my trip and didn't really need them. It didn't make much of a difference to me, but I did notice their absence. 

Overall, this trip has been one of the best I've had in a long time. I’m not sure if I’m supposed to leave a 10 out of 10, a five star, or swipe right but.....you had me at, ""I need your credit card and your ID.""",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-28T08:46:09-07:00

Each time I have had to spend nearly an hour on the phone with booking.com to find out that the message is fraudulent.
