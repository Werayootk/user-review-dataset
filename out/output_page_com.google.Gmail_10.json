Other than the no tone and the reply position, the rest of the app seems to work quite reliably.  \nWhat I really hate is Google's photo library, which digs (snoops) out every picture it can find in every folder even remotely connected to your computer.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-09-15T09:12:42-07:00"},{"id":"10586006338","userName":"jess57493958384","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id525642513","version":"6.0.231029","score":1,"title":"This app is missing basic functionality","text":"I don‚Äôt review very often, but I had to with this one.
