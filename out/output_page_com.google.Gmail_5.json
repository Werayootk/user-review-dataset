You are burning out special education teachers. I know money is involved regarding the amount of students per school but without teachers what would be achieved. The paperwork per student is unbelievable. So a cap for the students per special education teacher is needed. You are allowed 5 days for paperwork but most teachers are not receiving it. You need to rethink about caseload in classes. Sped teachers need help and more training is necessary. State continues to change rules but walk in our shoes for a week. This is anew generation of students.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-23T08:45:45-07:00"}]
