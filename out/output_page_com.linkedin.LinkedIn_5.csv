I just have a few possible bugs to report about this version of the app. I love the LinkedIn app. Great features. Quality user experience and interface. The app mirrors the desktop app very well.

Here are my concerns to report

• The LinkedIn app freezes when I go to my profile page regardless of how I try. I’ve swiped right on the screen and I’ve pressed my profile image in the top left corner to get to my profile. The app then freezes on the LinkedIn feed page.

• I’ve been invited to provide responses as an expert on a few LinkedIn led marketing articles or conversations. The articles mention receiving a “Top Voice in {Insert Industry}” badge when more than a few of these expert sourced articles are responded on. I haven’t received a badge for either of the industry categories I’ve been responding on.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-02T09:40:11-07:00

I would give negative stars if possible now. The big problem is LinkedIn is now censoring things at the request of the chinese communist party. Censoring viewable access on things like the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protest Massacre, as well as other content not approved by the chinese government. With LinkedIn now willing to serve the interest of China over you and me its users, I’d give them negative stars with a negative rating if possible. Sad how a once good app has become another chinese tool against truth and freedom.

I tried login in through a computer and laptop and I was able to get in just fine. I have the latest iphone but for some reason I can’t use the app anymore after the update.
I contacted the developer and they can’t do anything because they don’t know why it’s doing that. 
If they don’t know, and I don’t know now, then I’m basically screwed and can only use it on the web??? This is ridiculous and it’s caused me a massive inconvenience.

1.  Linkedin is not a single developer app where app hang issue could not have been caught in QA cycle before releasing it to public.

2. There are large number of users who use it so such a basic issue in app before releasing to millions of users is unacceptable.

Linkedin app starts fine but as soon as I scroll 2 or 3 pages down, it immediately hangs and never responds back.  This is not some small bug,  it completely makes app unusable.

This kind of basic issue is reflective of Linkedin QA and dev quality or probably because as someone said, with ad based Free service you are not consumer who comes first for company, but you are the product.  This is probably why app was released to general public with such basic issue.  it is not simply your post disappearing or not showing up which I have seen in past which I accepted as part of free service deal, but app simply hanging is not acceptable even for free service.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-01T09:08:20-07:00
