Whatsapp doesn‚Äôt allow you to forward a msg to multiple groups if the msg has already been forwarded multiple times before reaching you.

The reason whatsapp could have done this is to track who sent the msg in the first place and to avoid spreading rumors/misinformation during uncertain times like this. So if you think about doing the below mentioned workarounds, please be aware of what you are forwarding. If you are forwarding something that‚Äôs not right using the below workarounds, whatsapp can find you easily now than ever.

A easy way to get around this is,
1. If it is a msg, copy and paste it and create a new msg Id to it and then you can forward it multiple times.
2. If it is a media, download and forward it to multiple groups. This will create a new msg id.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-02T11:43:58-07:00
