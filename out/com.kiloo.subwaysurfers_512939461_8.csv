It helps me reach for a goal (the goal being to beat my high score.) It definitely has kept me entertained during quarantine, even though I have my moments where I get angry and turn it off, (I have a anger management problem) But I go back and play it even more. I’d love it more if there were more maps you could unlock. Like instead of (Im guessing) a map looking like New York (the current one) How about one on the beach side, Or safari, with golf carts as the “trains”. Or when you unlock a new character there’s a story to tell you more about the character, Like frank, he looks like a business man, maybe a spy. Just something that would be like a backstory to the characters. Love the game, I’m addicted to it!

The characters and hoverboards look cool even though they cost a lot (but only a couple things are actual money). Since this is a game you can play without WiFi, it’s fun to play in the car or another place with no internet. However, my account has a problem. I used to play on another device, but when I switched the account to my new one, some items I had recently bought didn’t make it over (and they were still on the other device). Also, I can only collect coins from runs, none of the prizes I get from mystery boxes count. It’s frustrating and I would very much like that to be fixed. Sorry for the length of this I just wanted to make myself clear. Have a good day and keep making this game better!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-05T08:41:36-07:00

I got out of my mini van and went inside the small town cafe. I then see a sign saying that dixie dimelo would be singing her original song made by her “be happy “that day. I sat down and begin to play the game not focusing on the music playing. I then hear a ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ in the distant i stop for a while and see dixie singing. I then begain crying realizing that the characters in the game are just as her song says. “ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ 🤷sometimes✨i🙁don't😢wanna😱be😼happy🧚don't✋hold😇it🤪against😈me🙆” is the line that made me being crying. The characters are just teenagers who are troublesome because they feel as if they haven’t gotten enough attention in there life.

However, one time I opened the app and it wouldn’t load. I tried countless times to see if it was just that one time but it still wouldn’t load. I tried updating it and even deleting and reloading the app to see if it would load, but it still wouldn’t. I don’t know if this problem is our bad WiFi or my phone or something, or if a bug in the game that won’t allow me to play. 
Don’t get me wrong, I love this app, I just can’t play it because of a glitch that I would like to see fixed. If you have any more suggestions on how I can try to get it to work, please let me know. This could 100% be a problem on my part, I just want it fixed.

But there is one thing wrong it is like they don’t want to let you die. By that I mean they always give you saves like when you fall or die they say you can watch a ad to Keep playing. I mean it’s not bad but I feel it is not good. And they always want to give free stuff for watching a 20 second ad.i think it would make it much better if we could be more independent and for that would be awesome but this game is lit!!!! I love how you can earn characters and new clothes for your new people and you can also compete missions and you can earn Awards and like I said before this game deserves a Oscar award and by all means PLAY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-31T17:30:11-07:00

But for some reason it has asked me to type on the passsword for the old apple. Me not knowing what to do I had deleted the app thinking I would log back in to mine and get my things back three Game Center. But this is not  how it worked the game had restarted my me all the way back to where I only have one character.

The game play is simple and addicting which is why it’s my favorite time-waster. However, I don’t understand having a limit on how many rewards you can redeem in a certain amount of time in the season?! I put the hours in to get the tokens why are you forcing me to wait to redeem them?! That seems scammy to me, almost like you’re forcing people to have to “open” the game again at a later point which leaves a horribly bad taste in my mouth. I understand your whole “existence” is to have people spend as much money and time as possible on a simple mobile game but these types of practices are why mobile developers are looked at as a joke.

I don’t like that. It’s annoying.

The graphics and art for this game is overall outstanding and I think should honestly get a reward. It’s super smooth and looks just really good. 
Second of all this game has so much entertainment. Subway servers is defenitly the best game to play when your bored. Like when your in a long car ride or just want something to do at home. You collect things, do tasks, and unlock new skins!
Lastly, the game updates a lot? And when they update they will add limited skins and change the map. It just makes it more fun to play because you can look at new things. 
So if you haven’t yet, I strongly encourage you to try out this game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-24T11:48:56-07:00

Like, if someone got a new device to play on and wanted to have the same data from before, they couldn’t “move” their progress to a new device. I think if accounts were an option on the game, it would be a lot better. Accounts don't have to be a mandatory thing, but it could be an option for the players in case they wanted to login on another device and have the same progress.
Theres also a bug on the game where sometimes when I move to the right or left lane, its like bumping into something and the cop catches up again. This can make it a lot easier to lose the round and is very frustrating sometimes.
I think those are my biggest complaints.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-07-13T04:52:55-07:00

It’s so funny to se people get angry like when Kai kenti’ a popular YouTuber getting very mad. The main goal in the game is to complete quests while running between trains and the point of doing the quests is to get money, you can see your quest’s if you start your run from the police and click the pause button on the top left corner of your screen and quests will show on your screen or you can see it at the start screen.

Like when I reach the end, I win a massive prize! Even though there is no end, which makes it the more fun! And there are missions, and you earn keys, and you can get a world record of the week! Keys are useful for lives, like the first time you crash, it’s one key or a video for free. The second time it’s one key, the next it’s two, the next is four, then eight, then sixteen, and so on, times 2. You get outfits, like fifteen keys equals one outfit in the character Tracy, so on. There are lots of characters and their outfits, so make sure you check it out by downloading the app! It is super fun, and it’s free!

This game is AMAZING but honestly, why do all the characters have to be so expensive, like, for some characters and outfits you have to collect like, 100 items or over a million coins and some of them you have to ACTUALLY buy? And second of all, why can’t the characters have a pet running beside them? And maybe you can make it to where people can connect and see each other in a race? Also, ALL the FLIPPING boards have to be ACTUALLY BOUGHT. And can’t you put an offline version for people who don’t have internet? Cuz sometimes I have to make three hour drives, BUT I CANNOT WATCH FREAKING ADS TO HEAL MY PERSON BECAUSE I HAVE NO FLIPPING INTERNET?!!!!!!

BUT I would still like to see some more characters for instance a rat or a chef for example. Another thing about this app is the characters are VERY expensive and as a fellow poor member of the game I feel very offended I can’t update my outfit. Another lovely addition that would make this app 10x better is if there were maps. Like at the begging on the game it would give you a choice such as North Pole, Desert, Original, you get the point.

I just started playing but i’m awesome at it. I suggest that you add another game called called Subway Catchers where you are the cop. You could run around and grab the things the guy catches try to outsmart him. You could also make this a multiplayer where one guy is the cop and the other guy is the spray painter. You could also make a cops and painters mode(See what I did there). Where you start of standing there and the cops have to get the painters each round is 10 minutes and you can leave any time.

I just think maybe some improvements here and there could make the game better for example, maybe having custom characters that would be really cool. You can also add a feature where instead of having to use either the magnet or the jump shoes right after u get it, the game saves it in the corner of the screen and then you can click on it when u want to use it. And whenever you get mystery boxes u can chose to save them or open them and once you save about 10 boxes you can keep collecting or you can trade them in for coins maybe like 500 coins per box, or something else idk these are just ideas that I think would be cool for the game.

I play it almost everyday with something in the background to relax. Overall it’s fun, characters are amazingly designed, and I genuinely enjoy it. A few recommendations, maybe do an event where you earn more keys. Like maybe 20 keys each time you finish something, or like an old event where you gave out 800. I understand keys cost money and it may defeat the purpose of making money but it would make the game 10x more enjoyable. I would also recommend bringing back some old characters such as Coco.

I went on subway surfers and this wasn’t my first time playing this. The game asked for my age again I was wondering why since I already put it before and it wasn’t my first time playing this. Yesterday I went and bought a 2 dollar character and today I got SCAMMED. All of my progress wasn’t there it started me off with a tutorial and I had NO coins and my 2 dollar character wasn’t there and I would have to buy it AGAIN, witch I didn’t.I hope it was just a glitch but if they really scam you DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It was really concerning to me because this was my childhood game so I trust it completely but today I JUST found out they took all of my progress away and started me off with JAKE. Pls respond to this because I’m very concerned is they really do scam you or it was just a glitch for me.

A couple years ago I finally decided to install it on my phone and I was so surprised. Compared to when it first started, they have added so much!!! There’s more characters, you travel around the world and move every once in a while, and you can collect new things on the Subway that get you prizes and coins! It works well without Wi-Fi and always saves your progress, so you don’t lose prizes or coins. If you don’t have it, GET IT! Time flies so fast when your playing.

1) you MUST agree to disclose your personal device data to their ad network in order to play.  I applaud them for making that blatantly apparent, but there’s no telling what their ad network partners do with it.  

2) at least one way that they use that data in game to serve WAAAAY too many ads in my opinion.  Show an ad maybe before or after playing a game, no problem.  But this game shows ads while just browsing through menus (of which there are many).  Not only does this make for a poor user experience, it just seems greedy.   

3) several of the video ads I saw had a “false x” in the top right corner.  Those are out there to give the appearance (especially to children) that the user can press the X to close the ad.  You can’t.  Pressing that X is just like clicking the ad.  The times I saw it, the ads were for other games, so it would open the App Store.  I think this is borderline fraudulent and something Apple should be monitoring.   

So yes, the game is very fun.  I just don’t think the way ads are treated here that this game should be considered kid friendly and the age rating should be changed.  At the very least give me an option to pay for the game and remove ads and data tracking.  If that option exists in this game, I did not see it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-30T07:24:21-07:00

Keys can help you “escape” also they can buy power ups,limited edition boards and skins, and power ups. But they are so hard to find!!

I downloaded this game because my bestie came over with there phone and we played each others games. They had Subway Surfers. When I played it I loved it! I was so fast to download it on my phone.

Also you can connect to Facebook to reach your friends who also play subway surfers and play together. Now the gameplay: it’s great! You can jump on top of trains, collect thousands of coins, use hoverboards, use jetpacks, etc. I would say at least 20 character/ outfits. This is that game that you want on your device trust me :)

Whenever I discover a new fun app I always end up deleting it a few days later because it’s riddled with ads. Subway Surf actually is really good about NOT shoving ads down your throat. You’ll hardly even notice them. Plus, i don’t even mind them because Kiloo deserves the revenue.

The animation is top notch! It’s full of beautiful vibrant colors and really fun details. I love going through the subway and noticing small flowers or decorations. The characters are really fun and have lots of personality.

Kiloo does a few things to keep gameplay really fun. First, every month the game in set at a subway in a different city all around the world. It’s really cool to move around like that. Second, you can collect power ups in the game to give you advantages in the run. You can also collect coins that you can use to buy characters and hover boards with.

The game is perfect. Simple enough to understand, and hard enough to stay challenging for years. They don’t shove ads down your face and the design is eye candy.

Another problem I have is that a red notification bubble stays in the top right corner of the “Quests” bubble. I click to see why there is a notification, and the bubble is proclaiming that I have completed 4 achievements. I’ve scrolled up and down and I have no achievement prizes unclaimed.
