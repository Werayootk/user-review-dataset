It is 100% free, NO watermark, and has some really good features! It built-in stickers and filters that are well and good. Also, did I mention, IT HAS MULTIPLE LAYERS!! That‚Äôs friekin incredible!! I tested and it has up to five other layers of video or photo! This is one of the only apps on mobile that actually has multiple layers and is free!
Onto the not so good things...It has most of the basic features you need EXCEPT good Volume, the volume feature is really bad, you can barely turn the volume down it only sounds SLIGHTLY quieter when you‚Äôre almost all the way at the ‚Äú0‚Äù volume thing. Also, in my opinion there should be more options for volume customization maybe such as ‚Äúaudio stabilization‚Äù or something like that. Also the slow-down effects and the voice effects could use work. It has some really useful filters with camcorder and 90‚Äôs effects built into the app which is really cool. The transitions are actually surprisingly un-cheesy. I wanted to say thank you to the person who made this app!

Another bug is when I add an in animation then remove it then add a combo animation it doesn‚Äôt add it. ‚Ä¢I think hue shift should be added, there is the rainbow negative affect but it just looks to chaotic. I think there‚Äôs already a option for hue shift but I‚Äôd rather it be an effect. ‚Ä¢a search option for effects. Im pretty sure there used to be an option where you could search effects but it was removed. Please add it back, it takes forever to look for effects I want to use especially since there are a lot of them. ‚Ä¢I think the motion blur should be fixed, when I add motion blur to my edits there will be random spots on it which I don‚Äôt like. Sometimes it looks good but other times it does not. ‚Ä¢along with a search option for effects I think there should be one for animations also. 
‚Ä¢I think you should be able to overlay animations.

But it wasn‚Äôt really good‚Ä¶ in 4th grade my friend told me about capcut and that she loved how good it was, I was still with iMovie. Me and my friend (not gonna mention her name) are gacha tubers and we like editing so she recommended me capcut, I said no since my mom didn‚Äôt let me have to many apps and I already had 5 apps (games) in the summer of 5th grade I started thinking about downloading capcut. I asked my mom about it and she said ‚Äúok‚Äù and that was weird because she is ridiculously overprotective so I was happy, I immediately called my friend and she told me everything about capcut, the tips and tricks.. Im a fast learner so it took me around 3 months to handle perfectly capcut. Now I‚Äôm in 7th grade and My editing has definitely improved, and all thanks to capcut.

Like gory or scary things. (This app has nothing inappropriate in it, like nothing I‚Äôm glad) so I think that they should put a age restriction for parents to set up on the app so that children can use it carefully and don‚Äôt get involved with things they‚Äôre parents don‚Äôt want for them. Another problem I have is when I click on a template it shows a different template. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my phone or the app, but please fix it. Also, I think there should be more edit resources, like more things to edit with. I think that using the same things over and over again are pretty boring so if you could add new things I‚Äôd be really pleased!

When I started everything was free to use. You could do anything, and it cost nothing. But lately, they‚Äôve added Capcut pro. Which I don‚Äôt mind, they need some way to make a profit. But they‚Äôve been taking some of the old features and made them Capcut pro exclusives. They have also made over half of the features only usable with Capcut pro. And it‚Äôs annoying seeing all of these things that I have to pay for. Whenever I want to add an animation for my text, there is SO many animations with Capcut pro. And some of my old favorites are Capcut pro. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Capcut and will most likely continue to use it, but if this keeps up, and more than 3/4 of the app is Capcut pro, I may find another app to use. I think there are  two things they need to do to fix it. Add new features, but make some free, and some on Capcut pro. And also don‚Äôt mix the Capcut pro stuff with the free stuff, have another section for the paid stuff.

Now my suggestions. I think if there were graphs and making your own transitions would be AMAZING, maybe if there were also motion blur in effects or like mirror like titles in alight motion it would be great and maybe even pass alight motion, and lastly maybe you could add like titles for your project incase you are deleting projects (for storage) so you don‚Äôt delete something you don‚Äôt want to delete.

 This app is already amazing so if you‚Äôre a beginner editor you should use CapCut it‚Äôs amazing it has great transitions, effects etc more things than alight motion has but alight motion is still advance with the graphs etc. So you should start with CapCut honestly before using any other big editing apps like alight motion or AE.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-29T22:32:29-07:00

It‚Äôs good for editing a quick video, or a long AMV. I‚Äôve used it for edits, AMV‚Äôs even a stop motion. There are just a couple of things keeping this app from perfection however.
Like with most editing apps, there is a premium. Like other apps, you can see the cool stuff that you get with premium. You can apply it to your video to see how it works. But sometimes, you can forget that you applied it. When I try to save the video, it tells me that I‚Äôm using pro, and I have to sift through the entire thing to find out what effect I accidentally left on. I think that it would be better if it was not possible to leave the effect on after applying it. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be able to see apply it at all. 
There also seem to be more PRO effects than normal ones. As a teenager without a job, I do not want to have to pay money to make edits for fun, and I think that the majority of the effects and stuff should be free. 
That‚Äôs pretty much all, some of this might just be me, but that‚Äôs what I think about CapCut",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-11T17:31:31-07:00

That‚Äôs not fair.. And it takes so long to progress, That I had to make the video much shorter so it can be faster, I also use this in school, And it took like 10-20 mins just so it can be exported, I hope you fix this problem capcut, it will be really helpful if you do.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-12-24T07:30:50-07:00

    the only thing i don't like about the app is that they update it EVERY. OTHER. DAY. not literally but it certainly feels like it. and i really hate the updates because they take away perfectly good features. there was a feature where if you went to the camera and clicked effects, you could put filters on and it was really fun and i loved that feature so much. and then they took it away. y'all can imagine my complete DEVESTATION. when i went to the camera, clicked on effects. and all that popped up was the green screen. i cried for 2 days. now of course this story is highly exaggerated but i was still pretty upset. other than that i like the app and recommend it, but capcut. if you are reading this. PLEASE DO ANOTHER UPDATE AND ADD THAT FEATURE. PLEASE. I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH MAKEUP FILTERS AGAINüò≠üò≠üò≠

There are little captions under effects and show you what they do before you use them. It‚Äôs honestly pretty easy for new comers, and it really just depends on how you use the app to make your edits. But there are a few problems as well, I‚Äôve seen people take others edits and people are pretty disappointed when they realize they can‚Äôt use the template. Second of all, most of the good texts and effects are in the premium pack. If you really want to make good edits, then I recommend getting it, because it really helps! One thing that I did want to note is that when you make an edit and post it, make sure to add your own watermark so if people steal it, then other people can call them out.

I dislike the fact that sometimes it kicks you out of the app but that might just be my phone. Also with all the people saying that you can't upload videos over fifteen minutes long, have you ever heard of ""Video merging""??? Also I found that if there is something like a background or something like that you can use iMovie for an easier upload (Might just be me but it kept crashing). I also use iMovie for videos over fifteen minutes long so they can be, over fifteen minutes long (XD). But I do have a suggestion with the app creators:

Could you please put in an option to start a template without having a video? It would be a lot easier to record straight from the app then having to do the process of recording, then uploading, then cropping everything and all that jazz. It's just so much easier to record straight from the app! But in total, if it wasn't for the recording thing I give it a solid 4/5 stars.

Although this app is absolutely amazing and helps me edit my other things, I do think the sizing is a little bit too much. I‚Äôm not a good expert at knowing how to change things, but if it could be changed I would like the app size to be a little different. This is pretty cool but I never knew how to use the green screen also. I never saw it anywhere but I‚Äôve seen so many people use the green screen effect on cap cut. If that could be changed everything would be awesome because I‚Äôve been looking for the green screen button for so long. I‚Äôve been using this app for months now and I do think that I‚Äôm getting the hang of it. It is a little confusing which I wish that could change but I mean, it‚Äôs an editing app it takes practice.

The reason why is because you can make so many videos of your own and they can be as long as you want, the app also gives you PLENTY of filters and effects to choose from. You can also use one of the templates other people make and put your own photos and videos in the template you choose! You can also change the text in some videos/templates to make them fit the topic I want. Another cool feature that I like about CapCut is that you can go up to the camera icon and you can make videos from scratch on CapCut. You can make POVs‚Äô/Point of View(s), funny videos, ect. And you can go ahead and add whatever face filter you want or anything really! Heck, you can even save your videos or your can save them so they can go to your photo app :)

on how to make a really cool edit to your video!

So adding videos to edit is really easy but if you want to add photos it‚Äôs going to take a lot of time or you need to go into your Photos app and favorite all of them first and then try and open them one by one from the favorite album but it still sends you to the top after each selection so it‚Äôs very tedious and time-consuming. I originally used InShot for all my video editing and then switched over to CapCut after learning about it on Tiktok but I think I‚Äôll switch back to InShot now. Essentially they feel like they do the same things but InShot never fails me or glitches while CapCut glitches often.

Also, sometimes I‚Äôll make an edit and another day I‚Äôll come back to look at it and see it is no longer there. In times like these I wonder if it glitched or if I deleted it by accident.

I also do not appreciate how a lot of features cost money, For example, every single pride sticker is in the pro version. My friend was upset about this. She said the exact words, ‚Äú Why do I need to pay to be gay?!‚Äù I quite agree with her. Not to mention all of the animations. Half of the good ones are with the pro version!

For example, if I were to type ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äù it would look like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äô t‚Äù. Whether I type it or let auto correct type it out, it still ends up like that. Unsure if it‚Äôs just a problem to me or anyone else, but if you can fix this bug then it would be a lot better. I mean, it just seems weird when text doesn‚Äôt have an apostrophe, especially in words such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve, You‚Äôre, and They‚Äôre‚Äù. So if you can, please fix this bug. Also, in a recent edit I made it added [ and ] to my text. So it would look like, [‚ÄúOh yeah! I went there!‚Äù] *Not what I said in the edit but it is an example*. It happened once I re-entered my edit to continue editing. I deleted the [ ] but once I saved it, it still appeared. So I‚Äôm really unsure if it is just a bug or a problem with my phone.

10144150629,The dragon warrior. üêâ,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1481916065,8.7.1,5,Amazing,"I love the app I am able to screen record songs or TikTok‚Äôs and add them to CapCut and are able to make my own videos. And I enjoy making video it makes me happy tho I do not really post. I enjoy to just do it or share with family or friends. tho as in suggestion to this app I ask that u put in more effects that so much do not include make up because my mom  even tho  she thinks the makeup is pretty she does not like that when I use it it‚Äôs the filter I like most so it would be nice if u could add a few more filters that not just adults but children can also enjoy besides the make up. Also can it also be a option that when u make a video and u put the filter on can u have the option in the editing stage to be able to take the filter off. Other than that I really enjoy the app. 
 

To the creators thank u so much to the wonderful app u created I am thankful I am able to use the app. And I love pretty much everything about it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-15T12:04:45-07:00
9600635866,Fluffy Anny,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1164928357,7.6.3,5,Amazing! And a suggestion!,"Capcut is absolutely amazing, whoever made this deserves a gold medal!! I especially appreciate how when Capcut added the Pro feature, they didn‚Äôt make effects, text animations, or anything like that that was already free a Pro feature. Instead they added new pro features instead of taking the old free features and stuffing them into the pro feature. I‚Äôve seen so many editing apps make things that were already free cost money and it has never gone good for them, Capcut seems to actually care about it‚Äôs users. I also love how it‚Äôs so easy to navigate, nothing is put into unnecessary confusing sections, it‚Äôs all right there and it‚Äôs easy to get used to. 

I do have a suggestion though!! 

Me and My friend would LOVE to make a project together, and I‚Äôm sure many other people would too!! What if there was a way to share projects with others, like adding them based off of their email or capcut account, then both people could edit that specific project. So if one person makes a change to it, it shows up on the other person‚Äôs side and they can edit it together! So both could be on a project at the same time and collaborate. I think this would be so cool and I‚Äôd love if Capcut took it into consideration. 

Overall, Capcut is such a great editing app for both beginners and people who are more advanced, and I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone starting or to any advanced editors who want a simpler editing app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-09T13:14:53-07:00

I almost immediately understood the controls and began making edits. The effects are all amazing, (shakes, transitions, video effects,  animations, etc.) but could be more advanced. While you can export a video after having used one animation then add another in a different project, that is extremely tedious. All I‚Äôm asking for is smoother, more professional looking animations (mainly shake animations that don‚Äôt look choppy üò≠) Still, I have nothing against this app and highly recommend it. The only problem I‚Äôve had is with the smooth slow motion effect making weird, green frames within the video clip your trying to apply the effect to. Otherwise, everything works amazingly. It always blows me away to see what people can create in this app, and what continues to be added. I won‚Äôt switch editing softwares for a LONG time. ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-04T15:40:35-07:00

Not only is it free but it does everything you could possibly imagine. I started using this app when I was about 8 and now I‚Äôm 15 almost 16 and am still using this app today üòÜ. I did. have to learn some things and what they do before I uploaded videos to the internet but it took 5 and not even 5 minutes to figure out were things go and what things do. And I became a very good editor! Not only is this app free and you can upload videos from to U-Tube but, you can also just make videos for you to watch , your family, and friends. I love this. App because it‚Äôs also like Snapchat and it has filters and everything! You can also upload it to capcut and make your own templates to use for start! You can watch other people‚Äôs videos too!

Maybe the next update you can make it go to 10 minutes. Also, for signing into the app, instead of just having Apple, TikTok and Facebook, do you think you can add Google as well? The only reason this app didn‚Äôt get the extra star is because when I record something on the camera, 99% of the time something will come up that says ‚Äúvideo or photo removed from your device. Recover it in your album‚Äù even though I didn‚Äôt delete anything. CapCut has never had something happen like this before and it‚Äôs very irritating. I‚Äôll work on videos the whole day just to realize this happens. I‚Äôm considering using a new app the record things stop and go. I hope you can get this fixed. Thanks for your time!!

The problem I have, is that CapCut is starting to make a lot of stuff ‚ÄúCapCut Pro‚Äù. I know they‚Äôre trying to make a profit but they‚Äôre making the simplest effects pro. Example: Vibration Flash, a simple effect that flashes a second of light and disappears. I‚Äôve used this effect in many of my edits but now that they made this pro. It wouldn‚Äôt feel as simplistic anymore, and I would start having to remake the effect with other effects or overlays. It really wouldn‚Äôt just feel the same anymore as I have used it for so many of my edits. And it wouldn‚Äôt feel as simplistic, and I have a feeling this could be a problem to a lot of beginner editors who are just getting into editing. Because they see an effect they like but can‚Äôt use it because it‚Äôs pro. I‚Äôm just sharing my opinion, because I am a little frustrated on this ‚ÄúCapCut Pro‚Äù subscription. And it really wouldn‚Äôt feel the same or as simplistic (again) as used to.
