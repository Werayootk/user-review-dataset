Sometimes the connection is a bit of an issue. I like how you can do Grwms on it/ dances/basically anything. If you want to you can make an account and post some of your edits but if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. I like how you can share some of your edits on messages, instagram, TikTok, etc. It’s a pretty good app for kids. It’s kinda like CoverStar and YouTube and TikTok to be honest. Just not exactly like it. I also like how there’s different templates for different holidays. For an example, Easter! It has a lot of different templates to choose from. I also like how you can save all of your projects to your space on your device.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2024-04-01T10:49:37-07:00
