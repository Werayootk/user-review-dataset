I reported comments that were sexually harassing a woman on LinkedIn and they refuse to take the comments down. The employees named Savio and Victoria personally ensured the comments stayed up. LinkedIn and its employees fully endorse and support sexual harassment and will go against their own safety guidelines to let it happen. If you are a woman they will not protect you so be wary signing up for this site. This is a factual review based on my experience. I will post it as much as I need to.
