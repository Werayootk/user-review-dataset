In my experience as of April 22, 2020, multi-person editing (one person per paragraph) while on audio is a hysterically productive madhouse of rapid collaboration.  It’s like watching Lionel Messi and the whole Barcelona football team do rapid-fire one-touch triangular volleys ending in a goal. 

However, at the moment, PowerPoint allows only one person at a time per text box (wish it could be one per bullet), and for some reason I can’t edit Visio in Teams(wish I could). Best I can do at the moment is share my screen and watch someone else edit my file while I point out things with my mouse.

By signing into a meeting I already am seeking a full meeting experience.

This is not an added feature, it’s a more inefficient way for the user to get back to the experience we had before last week…and now we’ll be hearing people comment for the first 3 minutes of conference calls or when “they can’t find the mute button” for the next week because they can’t figure out how to unmute. 

If having a reduced feature meeting is necessary, don’t make it the default. Make the setting something I can toggle to if I don’t want the full meeting experience. 

Until a user figures this update out on their own they are stuck with:

- No way to enter full meeting experience without attempting to unmute the first time/cannot make this change via view settings
- No landscape mode
- Distracting reaction emoji animations being on the screen 100% if the time 
- Needing to “slide” the controls card, press the unmute button, press/agree to full meeting experience, press the unmute button to fully unmute the first time

In general this app has been great and a lifesaver during WFH periods that started in 2020, I would otherwise give it a 5 star review…but this latest update is distracting and inefficient.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-25T05:31:28-07:00

A week or two ago, an update to the Teams app changed the order in which messages appear in a channel, so that the newest messages are at the top instead of the bottom.

Maybe this makes sense somewhere. But in the context of all other messaging apps, and in my own brain, it makes no sense. Even the desktop app shows the newest messages at the bottom, making going from one device to another inconsistent. But what annoys me most is that I cannot find any settings to change it. Productivity apps without good settings will only help the people whose brains work the same way as the designer’s.

My opinion is based solely on a few weeks of heavy use of Teams since COVID-19 has forced our crew to rapidly transition to working from home, so there could still be a slight chance that what I say fails to take all circumstances into account.

That being said, I really have enjoyed Teams as a collaborative tool. I’ve organized and participated in meetings with multiple users (usually 3 or 4, up to 10 on a few occasions) and the Teams interface has functioned flawlessly almost every time. 

Screen-sharing with audio communication, video conferencing and group presentations are the features I’ve used the most, and they are all user-friendly and simple to execute. The multi-user meetings with content sharing even worked well on my iPhone (this was something that truly impressed me). Plus there’s a “give control” option that you can use if you need hands-on help trouble shooting an issue on your device (fyi - I’ve only used this feature on our company’s Macs and PC’s, haven’t tried it on a phone or tablet).

My only difficulty with teams is that using it as a company wide platform means I have an abundance of active teams spaces and conversations are hard to manage or even maintain.

At this point it is easier to use text and email for both messages and content.  The only useful thing it has that the PC app and web interface doesn’t is the ability to show if a user has access to Teams or not, but since chat is hobbled already, it’s meaningless.  The only thing I find helpful is the calendar because I don’t sync my work calendar with my phone because of the way it integrates with my personal calendar and this keeps it separate.

1. Call history, voice mail, chats, and other screens perpetually are stuck loading. Restarting, reinstalling, force quit all do nothing to help. 

2. Video feeds are inconsistent/fail for group calls if you try to navigate the ap or switch screens at all. Audio will continue, but the video gets cut. 

3. Multiple notifications for the same events -- if you miss a call, it shows up in the calls (when that works, see previous) and activities, with no logical way to dismiss the notification. Unlike ios call log, where all you need to do is open the screen to acknowledge the missed call, there are multiple menus to navigate for each one to mark as read / seen. 

4. When the call history fails (per #1), the ios call history is also affected, meaning you can't find or make return calls at all from the ap or operating system. Hope you have a backup way to see who called you.
