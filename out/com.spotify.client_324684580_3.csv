Sometimes it gets stuck in that mode or it just switches between regular shuffle and smart shuffle and disable the option to play straight thru , and I personally have certain songs in a certain order on various playlists or sometimes I like to just play an artist selected songs in a specific order so when that smart shuffle is active , it just messes up my whole vibe. Today I had to close the app about 4 times before I could turn it off . It’s really annoying and I never use it . Please add an option to turn it off completely.

Some songs I need to listen to them again and I don’t want to right away add them to a playlist!

It’s the free version!” You are right. However, take this in consideration: 1) Why, why, why would I ever want a bunch of songs that I “might like” show up on my playlist instead of the songs that I actually put on my playlist? 2) There should be a play button for the regular shuffle function, AND a separate play button for when you want to continue the playlist. This goes back to the unwanted songs that are tacked onto a playlist. No matter what, it seems that one cannot reset the playlist unless they desire the unholy wait time of a whole day. 3) 6 skips is pretty skimpy. Now, if the only songs that showed up in your playlists were the ones you put in there, than I would be fine with it. BUT, when I have to skip through 6 suggested songs that I had no intention of listening to, that “I’m fine with it” turns into “I want to swallow straight horse dung for 24 hours.”

Another issue is that sometimes you can add songs to playlists when you click on them - you have to click on them in a playlist instead of straight up clicking which just takes extra time spent to search for a playlist. There are other small similar issues like this which just make the experience a bit worse which builds up to just be bad. 

The computer app is totally great - if the phone app could just have the same basic capabilities this would turn my rating to a 6/5. Please change it!

Another feature I miss is having the ‘Recently played’ this was at the bottom half of the ‘Your Library’ screen.

I know that apple’s push for Apple Music puts y’all in a difficult situation, but if they have a scroll bar why can’t you. I’ve been trying to police myself from updating it and I’ve had to cancel a few close call updates to prevent the features I like from disappearing.

I’m selfish, sure, but SoundCloud does that for me; flowing with my vibe. I have some suggestions, and they go as listed:
1. I know Shazam already exists, but with this company’s massive art library, I think it’ll probably work better, but adding something that can detect songs sung or play would definitely help.
2. Able to listen to a 15 second snippet of a song, why not hear and judge the song if someone would like it. It’s hell when you have to take a risk of opening a song, only to get an ad and then later get another. If it’s too much work going through all music, you could notify a small survey asking listeners which section a song they enjoy the most.

However you can’t listen to a song itself, you have to add that song to a playlist. And you can’t listen to the playlist in order, it’s always in shuffle. There’s also a ridiculous number of ads. You can get rid of these things by paying a monthly payment (which I don’t have the money for). However, that is not what made me write this review. 

Every time, I open the app and start playing a song after a period of thirty minutes to an hour, the app closes and the song stops playing. So I restart the app and the song. However it does this several times in a row. I have done everything to deleting the app and reinstalling it, to making sure enough stuff is deleted off my storage space. I have also searched the internet looking for a solution and found none. At first I just dealt with it, but after so long it becomes really frustrating. And with that plus all the ads, it just isn’t worth the hassle. 

The final straw was today when I kept getting suggested tracks on a playlist that already had over an hour worth of songs. Normally, since this isn’t happening to other people, I would just assume it has something to do with my phone. But it only happens with this app and only this app.

I have to physically go into the app and restart the music. It’s becoming very frustrating to have to go into the app almost every time I pause my music.

Update: the timing out problem has been worse and worse!!! More often than not, when I pause, I have to go back into the app to let it reload. Something else it’s started doing within the last few updates, is sometimes, after it times out a couple times, it will show the time on a song counting up, but the song will not be playing. When I pause it, it jumps back to 0:03, and jumps forward to wherever it was when I hit play again, still with no sound. The only way to fix that is by completely closing out of the app and reopening it.

8102006152,andywarcats,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36826675,8.6.84,1,Doesn’t work,"The constantly changing playlists are still extremely annoying and disrupt the experience if you use downloaded versions (which I always do since I found them streaming and eating my data even on WiFi in the past)

There’s still ads in podcasts even if you pay, sometimes even 3 MINUTES LONG. I understand this is because the creators are paid so little that they need further revenue. Maybe pay them more so they can stop putting garbage up that I paid not to listen to

There’s no option to hide certain artists or podcasters which is very annoying because even though I’ve told the app I don’t like a song and want it to be skipped, but it still plays other music by the artist. I still can’t get it to stop putting Mumford and sons in playlists and their music makes me nauseous. Furthermore I keep getting suggested podcasts by an alt right transphobe who’s name I’d rather not even read, and there’s no way to hide his page or the suggestions. I would also like to hide the Christian music section, unless they will also add a Jewish music section that Christians can’t hide - just another example of Christian ideology being forced onto the world",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-06T09:54:35-07:00

If you add music to your liked songs or playlists, the app will add it’s suggestions in as well. If it’s in the liked songs it’s fine because it will go away once you add about 15+ songs, but in your playlists it’s always there. This would be fine if they just displayed related songs, but not played them. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, in your playlist it will say “you added:” and the songs you actually want to listen to, and then “we added:” and songs that will play if you want them to or not. I don’t know if you can get rid of it by getting premium, but I don’t want to pay for it either way. I absolutely do not want to pay every month just to not listen to songs I DIDN'T ADD in the first place!!! Otherwise the app is fine, it has free music with just a few ads, and a lot of songs not available on other apps.

Please change this feature, I’m sure many others will be disappointed to find out they will waste battery listening to songs they didn’t even want to add.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-31T23:17:15-07:00
9736868417,ddgydkkc,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1265740225,8.8.18,5,Needs UI improvement.,"Good platform that has most content and features you’d expect from a top provider in the  industry. There are a lot of minor issues that have existed for years though and I’m only saying 5 so it will be seen. 

Navigating through podcast episodes to get to the one that you are currently listening to (say so you can queue up an upcoming episode.) Currently the options are to start navigating from either the oldest or newest episode, that’s it. Next, the shuffle is far from being a true shuffle. Often the same handful of songs will be playing in a somewhat random order, but tons of songs will be played repeatedly while others I forget I’ve even downloaded. Honestly I could go on but I’ll stop here. 

That being said I use it everyday and love it. I just wish that the focus of updates would shift away from predicting what users want to hear and fix these nearly 10 year old problems.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-21T07:59:25-07:00

Only If u pay,"I have had my premium account for probably 10 years and just recently I've had to cancel so I can save some money. I am disturbed at how free users are treated. They change the layout of the artist profiles so that you can't even see the cover art. Like the artist's top songs are now just text there's no pictures or anything. Like why??? Is it really necessary to make the app not as user-friendly or cute just because someone isn't paying? We're still using the app regardless and I was a paying customer for many many years..and not even offered a discount or anything when I canceled online. It's just really sorry how these companies will treat you no matter how long you've been a customer. I remember when Pandora was a really great music app and you could use it for free and get a certain amount of skips but everything else worked as the same. Something about free is super restrictive and I'm not enjoying it. Hopefully the economy gets better soon and I can have the benefits back, but I just wanted to say how weird it is to treat the free users so differently for no reason.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-15T12:33:05-07:00

I’ve noticed less annoying pop ups too. And I love the addition of buttons to switch between a music mode and podcast mode at the top of the home page!! It’s annoying to have them all together, in a cluttered mess. Added a star for this. Customization of the home page would make this a five star app. Update 2: podcast playback is still very glitchy. Home page is far too cluttered. Pop up suggestions of podcasts to listen to are annoying, it’s never anything I’m interested in. Update: podcast playback is very glitchy. Sometimes the spot I was at in a podcast doesn’t get saved. Also video playback breaks often. Original review: The service itself is great and worth the money. But the app has been very glitchy lately and will tell me I don’t have an internet connection even when I’m connected to my 600 mb/s WiFi. The interface updates look good but sometimes make the app harder to use.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2022-09-10T05:38:23-07:00
