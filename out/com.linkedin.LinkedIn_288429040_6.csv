I think this might have to do with the fact that the app isn’t truly native to iOS. Instead it’s just framework port of the actual website. The worst aspect of the app is that it randomly dumps the state of the app that you’re working on when LinkedIn forces the “news feed” to update. You end up losing the article that you were reading or the comment that you were drafting. It’s incredibly frustrating and it would be much better if the app were written from the ground up by actual iOS developers.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2018-09-05T12:09:37-07:00

They literally collect what you do outside of the app. :) Especially what others apps you download and how you use/what you type in them.

If you differ from that, and challenge beliefs etc, good luck.
