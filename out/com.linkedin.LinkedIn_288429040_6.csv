10813948502,Essential Workflows,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id323166736,9.1.348,5,LinkedIn: the essential social media,"LinkedIn is a top level networking technology tool that allows the introduction of those working in areas of interest to its audience. It allows its patrons to connect with those who work within their industry from all over the world, gather the newest information to improve their skill set, and keep abreast of where jobs and pay are most plentiful. However, I believe it’s biggest claim to fame is bringing in those generations or individuals who do not participate in standard social media. Those individuals who have something to say from a professional standpoint, but still see the value in getting likes. Discussions on LinkedIn, bring in both an educated and experience level discussion on topics that currently impact society, making it essential when measuring a dynamic group of informed minds.

10803159730,Guyho,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id114705377,9.1.347,3,I’m losing my reading place. Please give us control of feed refreshing,"While I truly value my LinkedIn connections and their insightful posts, I’m growing more frustrated by the app behavior of auto-refreshing my feed causing me to lose my place. Argh! There are two aspects to this problem: 1) When I pause on a post and click a link to read that link’s content, I may step away from my phone for a bit, especially if that content is a long read. When my iPhone or iPad is reopened LinkedIn decides for me that it will refresh the feed and I lose my place. The same happens in the main LinkedIn feed. I don’t personally want that experience. I’d rather manually decide when I want to refresh and keep a static placeholder on where I left off my reading of posts. How can I do that? 2) For linked content via url, it would be best if you opened that content in a browser since the browser app would better allow me to retain the content as a static tab. For the basic LinkedIn feed, I’m not sure what to do. Yes, I know you offer a “save” feature; however I would normally only save something after reading most of the content and determining whether it’s worth saving. Isn’t that the “save” feature design intent? I’m sure LinkedIn developers didn’t mean for me to save everything I read just in case I might truly want to save it, then have to remove most of the saved content after I decide I don’t need to save it. Yes? That’s backwards. What happens is when I’ve just started reading a potentially intriguing LinkedIn post, then distracted by something else outside the app, it causes me to lose an otherwise valuable resource because the app refreshes my feed without my permission when return to the app. PLEASE, just give us control, e.g., let user set an “auto-refresh” toggle preference if they chose to do so, or set it as “manual refresh” wherein we can apply a top of screen pull down gesture to initiate the refresh. What do you say? Can do? I’m certain I’m not the only one frustrated by this happening. If this is an iOS problem I’m happy to also raise this with Apple, but I expect you to work with Apple to resolve it, please, and in the meantime figure out how to work around it to help users retain context to their stream.

10801269887,MikeRules99,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id251624671,9.1.347,1,Eh it’s okay,"LinkedIn is not as good as it once was. It became more like Facebook than a job search site. LinkedIn never found me a job even though I applied for several. LinkedIn does not give much help when it comes to resume building, networking, or help actually landing the job you qualify for. LinkedIn learning certifications are absolutely useless, I found better educational videos on topics using YouTube. The truth is LinkedIn has a reality distortion field, it makes you think you need it but you don’t. There are way too many spam accounts and I really wish people would stop messaging me, unasked by the way, to fix my resume. I really hate this site and it needs to die. Worst job website ever. If you pay for LinkedIn learning you are a sucker.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T22:28:42-07:00
10800504028,gorchimundo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1266078030,9.1.347,4,Good overall but I do wish there were more filtering options,"I’ve gotten a few jobs from indeed over the years, it’s a good site and generally you don’t come across an overwhelming number of fake or outdated job listings like you do other places.

The only improvement I’d wish to see is improved filters for wages. If there were an option to filter out jobs that don’t post the salary themselves or an option to filter out jobs that post salary ranges that would be great.

If you set your filter to something like $40,000 a year let’s say, many jobs will have a pay range listed with the high end within your desired salary, but a low end that’s far lower.

It is also frustrating to look for “Entry level” or “No experience required” jobs and need to scroll through dozens of jobs that require bachelors or masters degrees in specific fields. I understand those can still be entry level, but it would be really convenient to filter out jobs that require specific degrees. Often times the existing options aren’t capable of this. 

Good app tho",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T16:52:40-07:00
