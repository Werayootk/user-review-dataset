Since the individual chat wallpaper feature was introduced back around December 2020, it has yet to be available on my iPhone X, despite it working properly on my old iPhone 6.\n\nI contacted customer support regarding the issue multiple times but they send me unrelated emails referring to internet connection issues and other random stuff before finally replying many emails later, that this will be fixed in a future update; a few months later, the feature is still missing. Very disappointed.\n\nOther than this issue, the sticker packs are nice when texting and the app overall is quick and responsive. 3/5","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-10-01T08:14:05-07:00"},{"id":"7563323575","userName":"Alex or our Chino","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1180025864","version":"2.21.131","score":3,"title":"Scammers on WhatsApp","text":"Yes it’s a good app I like the app very easy to use the only bad part for blind people it is hard to navigate voiceover on iPhones yes but it’s a good app very fun to use and everything like that but the only problem is you have to slide through all the apps or messages that you have the chats but basically once you get through that and you find the chat you want or you swipe down to the notification and you were see the notification from the person you want physically have them send you the message first then you go to the notification and you by law you have it from there and then you can get it fixed and going from there it’s a good app I’ll give it five stars actually give a nine stars or 12 stars or 15 it’s just a good app and you know it’s seen every day","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-10T23:53:54-07:00"},{"id":"9101411349","userName":"alvgalan3","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id629799022","version":"22.19.78","score":2,"title":"No IPad Version Forcing Me Out","text":"I love whatsapp, I use it to connect with all my friends and family around the world. But, as the owner of a design company, the app has hit a brick wall on what I thought was our forever stroll into the sunset.\n\nIm currently digging around to figure out which app to switch to because whatsapp is not at all compatible with my iPad. As a design company, the iPad is the ultimate tool for design communication. For my international team we use WhatsApp to communicate, but it doesn’t work for iPad. I know there’s a clunky third party web version, but Im looking for something smooth and easy.\n\nI know these reviews fall on deaf ears, but in general it seems a little absurd for the biggest messaging app in the world to not have an iPad version. This affects me daily and it’s pushing me away from this app. Looks like it’s gonna be slack or signal for us moving forward…","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=310633997&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-09-19T11:54:12-07:00"}]
