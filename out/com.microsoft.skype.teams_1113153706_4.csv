I have used the other collaboration apps (Google, Zoom, Slack) and none get close to the comprehensive integration that MS has achieved.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-25T15:32:41-07:00
10971065192,k1n9bur93r,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1043656822,5.23.2,5,The Teams experience made spatial. Impressive!,"I am not a power Teams user, so there might be features that others need that I have no insight to. So I will say, from the basic view of DMs, Team chats, and meetings then this is Teams as you know it! 
My only quibble is that I wish the ‘Send Message’ button was not located right in the button corner (where it makes sense for every other platform) I think with gaze tracking I have a harder time ‘focusing’ on that target and some times my eyes dart around nearby controls. It would make the day-to-day usage of the app more comfortable if the send button was made maybe a bit bigger and more central on the window. Could just be me though.

Thank you for the hard work!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-23T07:22:13-07:00
