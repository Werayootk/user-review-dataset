10890029104,RI UXer,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id174470950,6.1.1,2,Super frustrated with recent update,"I use Teams on my phone to take work meetings without needing to sign into a Microsoft account. It used to work great. Since a recent update though, joining a meeting without signing in is a terrible process. When I click the Join link in my email, it no longer puts me directly into the meeting; it makes me enter the Meeting ID and Passcode manually. To do that, I need to copy the ID from my email, switch apps, and paste it into Teams, then switch back to email, copy the passcode‚Ä¶ and AUGH when I switch back to Teams, it has backed out automatically to the Sign In screen, which means my Meeting ID is gone. I literally had to copy the Meeting ID and Passcode into a notes app, put them together as one string of text, copy that text, paste it into the Teams Meeting ID field, then select and cut the Passcode part on its own so that I could paste in both pieces of data that I needed without leaving the Teams app (and losing my progress). Microsoft WHY did you make joining a meeting without signing in so difficult and bad?? I promise you that no matter how annoying you make it, I am not going to sign in on my phone, even though that‚Äôs clearly what you want and what you‚Äôre prioritizing. Please fix this, thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-01T12:21:09-07:00
