I have opened an account, subsequently there was an issue with the verification, so I contacted the customer service of Revolut. 
The Customer service was hacked somehow, and the people who represented themselves as Revolut employees stole 3000 pounds from my account. When I realized, it was too late. The bank said that my money was transferred into Revolut account. I’ve contacted the police they’ve opened an investigation, after that I’ve collected all of the information , including phone calls, messages all of the information needed about this whole fraud, all they needed to do is block the account and refund my lost money, which they didn’t.
I am very disappointed I thought Revolut is reliable online bank for international use but apparently is not the company that claims to be!

It took me a while to get around in Revolut, what is obvious to them isn’t necessarily obvious to a user. Once you know your way around the app and service function as expected. 

Unclear interface and user experience in some important ways, unless you work for Revolut:

For example  I tried to find help about returning funds back to spending from a vault (savings), but they refer to a link that says “withdraw” under the Vault page. But what they don’t tell you is that to get there you must:
1. Click on the menu item Vaults
2. Even though you are already there, you must click on your vault again from a list which isn’t obvious unless you’ve created more than one Vault. 
3. Click on your desired vault, in my case just one. 

Result: after a bit of rabbit holing, you will find the Withdraw link.

Chargebacks are a HUGE pain and takes weeks or even months to resolve and unless the company that you are making a chargeback against literally says they are scamming you, they might not even help you at all.

Whereas if you make a chargeback with any customer caring bank, you usually get the refund immediately, the bank then does their investigation and ONLY if the business that you made a chargeback against can prove they provided you what they claimed. They will charge the money back from you.

I have had 2 chargeback requests in limbo forever now. #1 a flight that got cancelled, you’d think this would be really simple since it’s completely verifiable. But the chargeback has been pending over a month!!!

I tried contacting their support again (which is ONLY possible through chat) and it won’t even let me connect saying there’s higher than usual traffic. It doesn’t put me in a queue or anything, just kicks me back to the Home Screen.

Worst customer experience I’ve ever had with a bank...",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-19T08:28:08-07:00

Put in my phone number and PIN, it sends a verification email, tap the button, sends me to a browser which then sends me to the App Store. Endless circle.

Furthermore, Revolut’s security practices are questionable.  For example, if they want your feedback they will send you a link that requests your account credentials.
