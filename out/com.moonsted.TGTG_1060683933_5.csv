It‚Äôs basically local restaurants and smaller grocery stores putting together surprise bags of their food for super cheap. It can be hit or miss if you‚Äôre a super picky eater but otherwise it‚Äôs a fantastic deal and helps cut down on food waste. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of use out of it in DFW.

Edit after using it for a while. 

This app has still been extremely helpful and most definitely holds its value as far as I an concerned. Especially for people like me who enjoy Indian food and Tiff‚Äôs treats leftovers!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-07T12:46:07-07:00
