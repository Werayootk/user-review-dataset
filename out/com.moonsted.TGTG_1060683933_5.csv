It’s basically local restaurants and smaller grocery stores putting together surprise bags of their food for super cheap. It can be hit or miss if you’re a super picky eater but otherwise it’s a fantastic deal and helps cut down on food waste. I’ve gotten a lot of use out of it in DFW.

Edit after using it for a while. 

This app has still been extremely helpful and most definitely holds its value as far as I an concerned. Especially for people like me who enjoy Indian food and Tiff’s treats leftovers!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-07T12:46:07-07:00

All you can deduce is that if the restaurant isn't highlighted as ""great value"" then it's probably not worth visiting. If it's not 4.5 stars or ideally even higher it's likely not worth it but there's no other info to go on.

I like the overall concept, but it feels a bit greenwashed. If food waste was a bigger goal overall prices would be lower for day old bread. You have to think of it as a help to the small business to feel justified.

Additionally, it's got to be almost impossible if you have food allergies.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-05T12:23:56-07:00
