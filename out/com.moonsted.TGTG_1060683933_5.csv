There is no way to turn these off except for to turn off notifications entirely. But that means you won't get reminders to go pick up your food when you do reserve a bag somewhere else. Very annoying and poor user experience. I should be able to turn notifications on/off per store and per feature (e.g. Pickup reminders, promotions, ""save a bag"", etc.)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-26T07:50:29-07:00

I walked for 30 min in the blistering cold to the location only to find my order was cancelled on the app which I didn’t even know was possible. There was some weird delay in updating my order status and it only cancelled once I got to the location.

Again today I showed up 20 mins into a 2 hour pick up window and they were closed.
