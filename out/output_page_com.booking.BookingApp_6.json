The breakfast was delightful, the hotel itself was charming, and the staff were incredibly welcoming and accommodating.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of aspects that warrant consideration. Firstly, our room, the Bride Room, lacked windows, contributing to an airless atmosphere. While the room had a cozy charm, the absence of ventilation was noticeable.\n\nAdditionally, there was a minor hiccup with the curtains not providing enough privacy, especially given the room's location near the entrance. Despite these considerations, the hotel's positive attributes, such as excellent service and reasonable pricing, overshadowed these concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this hotel for its warmth and hospitality, but potential guests should be aware of the ventilation and privacy aspects, especially if these are crucial to your stay. I hope the management addresses these minor issues to ensure an even more enjoyable experience for future guests.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-11-30T02:31:32-07:00"},{"id":"7771743337","userName":"Tony P Not Happy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id422442083","version":"29.9","score":1,"title":"Don‚Äôt use if there is a chance you might cancel.","text":"I have used booking several times and never had an issue until I had to cancel I room.
