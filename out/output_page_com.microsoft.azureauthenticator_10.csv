People have lost thousands if not millions over Microsoft’s negligence.
Just fix the issue already so people can access their Coinbase funds and remove you from the app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-12T20:15:10-07:00
8605923917,Enkaskal,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id108345447,6.5.94,3,high hopes but restore from backup is buggy,i had high hopes that this would be the best one out there supporting all the hashes others have had trouble with as well as having the easiest backup solution i’ve found. unfortunately restoring from backup is almost entirely useless as the app consistently crashes upon restore. while some entries are restored after multiple attempts i’ve never gotten 100% unfortunately. not sure if it’s a scaling issue (i have around 40+ entries)?,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-25T13:53:02-07:00
8563384160,Alley H,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id20484138,6.5.94,1,Horrible,I can’t access a very important website and of course I can’t call them. This app has zero tech help. My last phone broke so I downloaded the app again but the codes don’t work with what I already had set up on my other phone. I need access to the website and this is so frustrating to say the least..,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-13T09:38:51-07:00
8434545775,daulyp,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id113374960,6.5.88,1,Still broken,"The app tells me to open Authenticator when I’m already in Authenticator and the only option is to authenticate by text which completely defeats them purpose of this stupid app.
Other reviews indicate that I’m not the only person this is happening to and I have already sent multiple bug reports to Microsoft.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-08T11:43:24-07:00

8116347096,LeReyNahjo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id494543902,6.5.85,1,Worst decision ever,We use office 365 for my work which is great!  But when the Authenticator started most people stopped being able to get into their accounts and if the Authenticator glitches it will require you to authenticate from a signed in Authenticator that isn’t signed in anywhere else.  Basically just sending you in circles.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-10T14:16:32-07:00
