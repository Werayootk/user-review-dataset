They hide the real prices from you until you actually hit reserve in an obvious bid to get you to pay more than you intended. They let you filter by price but only price per night and because the fees they add on can be anywhere from 30-150 dollars per night it’s actually useless for getting properties in your price range. If you’re using a price filter doesn’t that probably mean you have a budget for your stay and so you want a filter for the total price? They obviously know that but it’s just a shameless attempt to force you to scroll through overbudget properties to price anchor you higher and tire you out until you give in and pay more than what you intended. Very misleading and manipulative. My guess is that most of their five star ratings are from years ago.

Mostly, our experience has been positive…and much better than VRBO which was a terrible app. But there is something they need to fix before it comes up again for me.

First of all, however, I’m not a fan of the options available when setting up our cancellation policy for our guests. For a full refund, you can set it up for 24 hours out, 5 days, or 30 days. No differentiation between 1-night stays, which aren’t a big deal and week+ stays which are.

But my current frustration is that I recently had a one-night guest cancel 4 days in advance due to a family emergency. I told them if they cancel, I could refund their money. I’d done this for other guests in the past. But after they canceled, I found out this feature had been changed, and I could no longer do what I’d promised. I had to go through the support team, explaining the situation, having the representative misunderstand, explaining it again, and having them do what I should’ve been able to do myself. And oh the joys of a representative telling you how to navigate the app when you already know how to use it well and know what they’re telling you won’t work.

At least the website doesn’t have this same restriction.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T17:28:27-07:00
10800522456,Dfjigbdfjvf,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id915946822,23.50,1,Terrible hosts & Help support,"I had gotten a terrible review from a host during my birthday. There was a heat wave & the house was facing the sun for 4 hours, making us air out the house. Upon being outside, a neighbors dog ran up to us and we took him in for the night. We were kicked out the next morning, even the rep refunded us because they understood how unfair the situation was. This was my first time using the app. Due to that review, I can’t book anything else. Help did absolutely nothing & told me to contact the host. Don’t recommend this app— so many others I’ve heard had no chance to defend themselves against bad hosts, and there are more than you think.

10799295975,liljoeyy88,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id241171451,23.50,1,Has gone downhill!,I use to LOVE this service until I went through my first horrible experience of bedbugs. I had photos of the bites (30+ bites) I woke up with after my first night AND admittance/confirmation of bedbugs by host via Airbnb chat. I guess you need to also provide photos of the actual bedbugs in order to get your money back or a letter of doctor that the bites were from bedbugs. So for anyone else make sure you get all of the above when you go through this experience. Unfortunately the response from customer service on this situation (refund only of cleaning fee and service fee) was enough for me to call it quits with this service and start to use others.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-08T09:07:20-07:00
