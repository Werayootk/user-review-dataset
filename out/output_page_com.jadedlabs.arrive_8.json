I had a USPS tracking number and it showed that it was delivered the day before it was actually delivered.  I had to think then that it was delivered to the wrong address which has happened before.  Most of the time it will remain in the originating state where it first went into the system but stayed there for 5 days, then on the sixth day it was delivered from California to Delaware overnight and no other update.   Other times it will say it is on its way when it doesn't even have a label and then it will say it is waiting then it says out for delivery when it's still in a different state so for me to actually count on this app to track packages it's just as waste of my time.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-09-09T10:51:09-07:00"},{"id":"5609071340","userName":"T.J.
