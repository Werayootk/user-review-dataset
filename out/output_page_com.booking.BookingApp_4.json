Be sure to bring trash bags, dish detergent and a extra fan because the AC unit is not equipped to cool the space when temps are above 80.

There were local food everywhere and multiple restaurants within less the 5 min walking distance. Miss Clara (house keeper) was  absolutely amazing. She was willing to answer any questions we had and was one of the friendliest ladies we have ever met.
