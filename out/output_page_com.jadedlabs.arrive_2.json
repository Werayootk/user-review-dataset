The main reason I say this is it doesn’t give ETA’s on your packages. There isn’t really a excuse for why it isn’t. If you track something through UPS or Fedex they usually have ETA’s posted for you to see when it will arrive. It’s just not as helpful. Plus the interface seems kinda clunky and slow, where as AfterShip is very fast and already has everything loaded and updated when you open the app, and since both of the apps are real time (and they both are) there isn’t any real way to tell who’s shopping is more accurate. I have tested both very extensively, and they both match up. I just feel like AfterShip is a bit faster. Regardless both apps helped me a lot with my personal business. As a streetwear and designer reseller, I want to know where everything is at all times and when it will be arriving to me or to a customer, and this app was able to get that done for me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-02-13T12:54:00-07:00"},{"id":"9761845272","userName":"Blooodyfellow","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1187659276","version":"2.100.0","score":5,"title":"Second to none","text":"Where to start? …  maybe with this,..

So essentially Arrive will refuse to work properly until you let them access all your personal information/as well as if you don’t possess a gmail account at all (which is ridiculous because how many people use yahoo/hotmail etc.). That’s why it’s free with no commercials, because it straight up makes far more money from scanning all your emails and private information & then selling it to various companies than it would by making you pay a set fee to track all you deliveries.\n\nNever trust an app that requires full access to your entire email account just to function properly.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-03-04T17:38:31-07:00"},{"id":"6634469090","userName":"Lilly00777565","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id511744341","version":"2.15.0","score":2,"title":"Convenient, but not very reliable","text":"My experience using shop app has been very on and off.

Anyone can see that you purposely make it impossible for customers to completely delete accounts I have literally tried everything and can’t get any answers the when a consumer deletes the app then it should completely be removed from their phone at least made easy to find out how to get said app out of their phone! Maybe the attorney general’s office consumer protection can help get this off my phone as well as help me find any legal actions I can take! I have tried more than once and I can’t get any help and I can’t get this app out of my phone this can’t be legal!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-12-12T10:42:43-07:00"},{"id":"6567678431","userName":"Gozlarry","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id36674253","version":"2.13.2","score":4,"title":"Unexpected Benefit!  Wish I could give this 10 STARS!","text":"SHOP just saved me a lot of trouble and hassle.  I had mistakenly ordered from a scam website and paid through an online payment service. Shortly after I ordered the products (within minutes) the “seller” put in fake tracking information.  SHOP alerted me that the items I had literally just ordered had been delivered... get this... two hours BEFORE I placed the order.   By having shop alert me to this “delivery” I was able to login to the payment site and stop the scammer who, at that moment, was trying to have funds purchase a gift card.  SHOP saved the day!  THANK YOU!\n\nNOTE:  there are several negative reviews about SHOP, but if you notice they typically deal with problems with the SELLER that are taken out on the developer.  And yes... shipments during COVID and especially those from China may take an inordinate amount of time.  Again, not the fault of the APP or developers.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-10-23T21:23:05-07:00"},{"id":"5932469596","userName":"Aly 74","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id180226936","version":"2.1.0","score":5,"title":"You all are the greatest!!","text":"This is what I call excellent customer service!! I wish I could give them a 10 my transaction for the ACV weight loss supplement wouldn’t go through at first I knew I had money on each card I tried so I called the customer service number provided and I was instantly speechless because it was actually Ms. Marsala’s voice!! Sorry if I spelled her name wrong but she was so sweet she immediately said she would check with her team to see what was going on and asked me to text her number the error message I was receiving she continued to keep in touch and even stayed available until I made my purchase to make sure I was able to. I confirmed I was able to make the purchase I even got 2 bottles after getting such a quick response and such good customer service!!! Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! I will be ordering again and will give an update after my ACV pills start to work! ☺️","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-11T10:45:26-07:00"},{"id":"5723517692","userName":"Oreotaku","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id521822265","version":"1.11.0","score":5,"title":"Extremely Helpful","text":"I typically never leave reviews on Apps, but I had to for this one! I love ordering things online, and especially with COVID-19 and being quarantined to my house, I’ve turned even more to ordering things on the internet. I’m really impatient for things to arrive, and having no idea where my package is most of the time makes it even harder to wait! Most of the time, the estimated delivery day that websites gives is off either by a few days or ENTIRELY off. \n\nI first heard about this app when I decided to order from a Korean beauty store called TONYMOLY. I decided to download it, but I’ve now been using it for everything! It’s super easy to use, all you need is a tracking number and the package carrier and that’s it! \n\nNow I can get a picture of how quickly or slowly my package will come and can keep track of it through this app! I love it, definitely worth the download if you like shopping online.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-03-27T17:26:45-07:00"},{"id":"10807364052","userName":"L3wi547","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id325985897","version":"2.138.0","score":1,"title":"Fraud company","text":"This place is a fraud. They will allow anyone to try to sell on here. I tried purchasing a jump box for my car, the company then when non existent on their site and app. The support I got was to contact the seller, which no longer existed. I tried contacting the email they had given me and didn’t here back. After waiting a week I contacted Shop to give them my order number to check. They tell me there are a lot of orders with the same number, and they don’t have the store I bought my item from. They then tell me that they don’t have access to the sales information and they can’t help me. Do not trust this site, they are just out to steal your money. Please find other places shop and stay as far away from this place as possible. At least with other online shopping they stand behind what they sell. This is not at all the case with Shop. Shop, you may want to figure something out. The response I received from you all is even more suspicious. Apparently you all are not accountable for anything here. I will be sure to report you as a fraudulent company.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2024-01-10T13:21:39-07:00"},{"id":"8303458914","userName":"dianathegreat13","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id211059565","version":"2.42.0","score":3,"title":"Not sure what the use of this app is?","text":"I purchased this from someone and they actually sent me a link to this so I can track my package well so far I haven’t been able to track it!\nWhen you click on the tracking number all it does is send you to the shipper and you have to login with an account and I’m usually doing this with my phone so I have to go back find a laptop or computer to get the darn password. And not a big fan of USPS because even though I know what the password is it often says I’m wrong and I realize you’re saying it’s a computer you’re wrong not the computer   But some sites are just harder to use   Often you can just copy the tracking number or click on it if it’s in an email and it opens up the tracking information but not this guy now see you can also shop on it I don’t think I would shop with us based on the inability to track something but who knows all dogs can be taught new tricks just an unhappy old dog today","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-31T06:07:10-07:00"},{"id":"6290333488","userName":"KirsGoo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id49503864","version":"2.8.0","score":2,"title":"Downhill Since App Changed to Shopify","text":"As mentioned in many other reviews, this app really went downhill after Arrive changed to Shopify. Not only does Shopify want access to your email (invasive!), it doesn’t even read your emails correctly!  What’s the point of invading my privacy like that and NOT get shipping information right???  For example, my package arrived today and the tracking number reflected as such.  But Shopify insisted that my package would arrive 4 days later. Where is Shopify getting this information??? \n\nFurther, the map updates are all wonky. The map says my package was “delivered” but the map shows that it was delivered in “Oakland, California.” I don’t even live in Oakland! Please fix your maps!  It’s incredibly irritating when map updates are not accurate.\n\nOverall I resent the fact that this app forces users to give it access to their email but more than that, the app doesn’t even read your emails correctly!!!  If you’re gonna invade my privacy, the LEAST you can do is provide me accurate information based on the data you’re farming off of me.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-07T03:50:55-07:00"}]
