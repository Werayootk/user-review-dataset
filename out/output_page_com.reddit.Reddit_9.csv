I feel like I still have a soul after I spend some time on Reddit whereas I don’t when I used to use Facebook. 

The micro-transactions for awards is also a very positive experience. Personally I don’t use them, but people are willing to spend their own money in order to recognize others for achievements, humor, or touching personal moments that they’re willing to share.

To top it off, Reddit just killed Apollo. I’m not sure how 1 man can build an app that works so much better than reddits wholes development team, but the Reddit app is just bad.

So you go into notifications, turn them off altogether, and then next time you open the app, they’re back on immediate. So if you want minimal or no notifications on your phone, the only way to use this app is to delete it after using it and then reinstall the next time you want to check Reddit.

Reddit is a great online community, but the official application from ten years ago that just displayed the mobile site of the time was more pleasant than this. The amount and size of advertisements is unacceptable for a site of Reddit’s stature, and the fact that the pricing for ad-free access is only per-account rather than having a cheaper per-device option with no extra features is very frustrating. I’m not paying 100$+ a month for my separate Reddit identities to be accessible with no ads. 

Moderation tools still seem to be undercooked, despite the application being several years in development.

I haven’t figured out how to sort the homepage, which is frankly ridiculous.

I do like some of the new changes to Reddit such as community awards, I think they’re good and they add variety to how we interact with each other on the site.

Not a huge fan on how video content is displayed. If I want to watch the video linked, I’ll watch the video. If I want to read the comments, I expect to be able to ready the comments with have to see the video and manually move the comments section overtop of the video. 

Search on Apollo was also a lot better. It allowed me to easily differentiate between searching for a subreddit, user, or comment. Search on this app is as good as using search on Reddit site which should tell you all you need to know. You might as well go to google and search “xxxxxxx Reddit”.

By charging an exorbitant cost to all 3rd party app developers, they are not only removing the superior ways to view the site, and all of the necessary moderation tools that their own site and app do not provide, but they are also removing accessibility options for disabled users (e.g. Reddit-official does not support screen readers, which are vital for blind users).

They claimed they won’t be charging any 3rd party developers for API access so long as those developers do not charge for the use of their applications or make a profit from it otherwise, but this is a lie. Multiple completely free 3rd party apps with no income have had their developers contacted with the financial costs they will incur once the API restriction is instated in just a few days.

They are spitting in the face of the community that not only made their site what it is today, but who have also kept it that way all this time.

Numerous subreddits with HUGE member counts (1,000,000+ members individually) will be permanently shut down due to the upcoming removal of vital moderation tools. It will become a shell of what it once was unless they roll back these ridiculous demands.

Except people can comment on your post and it can be negative but the reddit community is usually there to help. Advice: even if somebody comment rudely do not worry about them.
