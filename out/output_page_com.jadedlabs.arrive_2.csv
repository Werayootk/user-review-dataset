My brother and I have been Jeep owners for decades and camping all over the country.   One day meeting my brother at a beautiful camp by the Elk River on a cold winter evening as we were getting set up.  He was telling me about this new coffee he found while watching a YouTuber who also did Over-landing made a mushroom coffee.  He pulled a can out of his Jeep handed me the can.  I looked it over and said,…”let’s try it.”  So we heated up some water over a fire and made two cups.  After we was about halfway through we both agreed this was the perfect coffee for us!   It was quick & easy for those of us that want our coffee now not later … lol.  We have been very very happy ever since we met :)     Dr.  Straight’s Coffee is … “Second to None!”

Edit (after developer response): Thanks for the response, but what you said contradicts the design of the app in its current form (which is different than it was prior to the last 2-3 updates).  You say it’s to provide the best mobile tracking app, while also (as in a secondary functionality) helping users to connect with their “favorite” stores.  In reality, the primary function seems to currently be as a shopping app and the secondary functionality is the package tracking ability - the inverse of what you said in your response.

To add to my complaint about the app, I also hate that the app automatically “follows” companies you purchase products from via ShopPay, as if to assume a user will purchase from them again and it isn’t just a one-time purchase. There should at least be a toggle to ask users whether they want to follow companies automatically or not.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-14T14:40:52-07:00

As an impulse buyer, or a last minute shopper, I want to relax while my package just shows up when I expect it to.

I no longer have to remember, “when did I order that thing?” Or what site did I order it from so I can search my inbox with 1272 unread messages for the one with tracking number. To only then have to search the tracking number, tap the link, and hope I have some vague estimate for where it is in the delivery process.

Not only does the app just automatically add tracking numbers to main screen with a feed of deliveries, it shows you a high level progress map to know where exactly your package is.

It’s accuracy in letting my know when a package is gonna arrive by lets me use my day for what I want - without fearing I’m gonna miss a delivery or wonder if it’ll be home when I get there.

I’m ranting now, but this is the ONE app every one needs whether they order a little bit, constantly buying stuff they don’t need, or they just need to make sure all their Christmas packages are on track with enough of a heads up to let you know if you need to come up with a plan B.

I’m not convinced that the bit storage holder is the best design available, but it’s better than nothing, such as Snap-on. I like the orange accent color and wish they had used some inlaid or molded some more softer orange grips in the handle similar to Snap-on’s  “instinct” handle design, to make the tool glow in the dark for a more functional design in a Construction environment. I also prefer the bits to be longer and I would used orange coloring (preferably fluorescent orange) on the bits to make them easier to find when people drop them and can’t see to find them, especially in the dark. It is a great screwdriver and I will use it in my Construction Company as a finish type tool for finish Carpentry work, such as door & hardware installation, fixtures & specialties, etc……… great Job and thanks for the great tool.

The new update involves the app not only promoting shops over tracking orders, but now the organization of my orders are completed messed up now. It used to be that all my in-progress orders would appear at the top of the list and all my delivered orders moved to the bottom (since they were delivered, I don’t have to look at them anymore). This was perfect. 

Now the update has messed up the list and my orders are categorized based on the date I placed the orders, so some of the preorders I have been waiting on that used to sit at the top of my list have been moved so far down the list (literally months and months and MONTHS ago) I have to scroll for a bit of time to find it.

Just send a tracking number that I can look up online. Edit: to add an update based on the developer response… yes, I understand what the point of the app is. It’s worthless. How often are people ordering from multiple Shopify stores that they need to track multiple packages? Honestly, there is no way to justify requiring an app and I deleted it the second my package came. Provide a link to track packages in the email confirmation. Easy. If people want to download a stupid app to track it then they can. Don’t force it on the rest of the population just so some exec at Shopify can say they’ve had a ton of downloads for the app they pushed for. 

Edit 2: since the developer clearly doesn’t know how their own app is used… You place an order on a website that happens to use Shop. If you check out using Shop, you don’t get a tracking number. Instead you get an email with a link that can *only* be opened with the Shop app. This requires you to download the app to track a package.

UPDATE: 
I now know that shop does not assist with order fulfillment if there is an issue, which is disappointing. So I guess it mostly provides shipment tracking and personalized advertising (the latter of which which I don’t want more of). On the plus side, their help after my review, gave me another avenue to resolve my issue of my package fulfillment, so that helps.

Klarna and Afterpay are slightly better because they allow the opportunity to move your due date if you run into an issue with making an a payment. Shop would have gotten a higher rating however there was issue with trying to make my final payment. Shop instructed me to download the Affirm app in order to upload a different form of payment for my last installment. Once downloading Affirm it would not accept the card, a Capital One CC. I went back to the Shop app where they allowed me to add it but would not allow me the option to select it to use for payment. After searching the Q&As section they claim they do not accept prepaid debit cards or Capital One cards, here’s the gag… my original order was accepted and  fulfilled with a Capital One prepaid debit card… all but this final payment of the 4 installments have come from my Capital One debit card.

Original review: I loved the app when it was Arrive. It wasn’t perfect, but it was pretty darn close. Now most of my shipments only show the tracking number, not the item(s) or where bought from. It takes several hours for tracking updates to appear in the app. There are no shortcuts to mark things delivered or archive it (I archive my shipments once a month to clean up the screen), you have to go into each item and mark it.

I do have 1 suggestion though. After I’ve copied the tracking number from the carrier on packages I have to manually put in, it brings up a list of carrier options. Which is great. The issue is once I select whatever carrier it is (which is always the first option provided because it’s smart like that), the list should go away.

Many have completely inaccurate information when it comes to where they are (cross-referencing the information with the actual shipping service), and most don't even have information, and are permanently loading sometimes even months after the order was placed.

I tried purchasing a jump box for my car, the company then when non existent on their site and app. The support I got was to contact the seller, which no longer existed. I tried contacting the email they had given me and didn’t here back. After waiting a week I contacted Shop to give them my order number to check. They tell me there are a lot of orders with the same number, and they don’t have the store I bought my item from. They then tell me that they don’t have access to the sales information and they can’t help me. Do not trust this site, they are just out to steal your money. Please find other places shop and stay as far away from this place as possible. At least with other online shopping they stand behind what they sell. This is not at all the case with Shop. Shop, you may want to figure something out. The response I received from you all is even more suspicious. Apparently you all are not accountable for anything here. I will be sure to report you as a fraudulent company.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-10T13:21:39-07:00

When you click on the tracking number all it does is send you to the shipper and you have to login with an account and I’m usually doing this with my phone so I have to go back find a laptop or computer to get the darn password. And not a big fan of USPS because even though I know what the password is it often says I’m wrong and I realize you’re saying it’s a computer you’re wrong not the computer   But some sites are just harder to use   Often you can just copy the tracking number or click on it if it’s in an email and it opens up the tracking information but not this guy now see you can also shop on it I don’t think I would shop with us based on the inability to track something but who knows all dogs can be taught new tricks just an unhappy old dog today",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-31T06:07:10-07:00
6290333488,KirsGoo,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id49503864,2.8.0,2,Downhill Since App Changed to Shopify,"As mentioned in many other reviews, this app really went downhill after Arrive changed to Shopify. Not only does Shopify want access to your email (invasive!), it doesn’t even read your emails correctly!  What’s the point of invading my privacy like that and NOT get shipping information right???  For example, my package arrived today and the tracking number reflected as such.  But Shopify insisted that my package would arrive 4 days later. Where is Shopify getting this information??? 

Further, the map updates are all wonky. The map says my package was “delivered” but the map shows that it was delivered in “Oakland, California.” I don’t even live in Oakland! Please fix your maps!  It’s incredibly irritating when map updates are not accurate.

Overall I resent the fact that this app forces users to give it access to their email but more than that, the app doesn’t even read your emails correctly!!!  If you’re gonna invade my privacy, the LEAST you can do is provide me accurate information based on the data you’re farming off of me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2020-08-07T03:50:55-07:00

I was originally using USPS, and UPS, and other tracking carrier services. I finally decided to give Arrive a change and honestly I have not been disappointed. As soon as I receive an email with a tracking number, it auto-sorts it into an Arrive group, and pulls the tracking number with some information for you to easily see on the app. It also lets you manually add one if you need to, and gives you the choice of seeing the original email within the app to see exactly what it is that your tracking. You can also rename the tracked item, and it also has great notifications. Let’s you know when an item is out for delivery, or delivered, and more. Overall I am highly impressed with the ease of this application and  it’s functional, and highly recommend it if your not already using it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-30T11:57:21-07:00
