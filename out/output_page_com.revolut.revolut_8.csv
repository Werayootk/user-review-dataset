I could not use my funds for anything, not to pay, not to buy crypto, i could not even put the money back into my own bank account, the account i deposited with. Had to use a bank account in a different country to get my money back. Of the $200 only got $154 while they stated $0 fees for that transfer. A lot of apologies from guest service staff but no solution that would let me get out unscaved.

Since they do not give you access to your wallet, one has to wonder id they really are selling you cryptocurrencies, or just numbers.  IMO they would build more credibility and confidence in their platform if they gave users wallet access.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-16T00:16:18-07:00

Calling doesnt work because they only have robots.

One merchant charged more than what they said they would and after disputing with them and trying to go through revolut's awful support, the money is gone. At other card issuers you have a chance of a chargeback.

However, recent changes have dampened my enthusiasm significantly. Support is distressingly absent when the card fails internationally—a dire situation for any traveler. To add to the dismay, I awoke one day to find my card cancelled without prior notice, a bewildering move linked to a ‘free metal upgrade’ offered months before.

Now for some obscure reason my almost instant international payments ground to a halt. No one at Revolut can tell me why other than I have to wait out a five day timeline.

The problem with Revolut has always been there is no phone number and nobody to talk to. This is a sausage machine.

Do not make a purchase through Revolut thinking they will honor their cashback offer - they won’t. Customer service takes forever to connect with, and they are extremely condescending and belittling.

They have removed all the best functionality and just made it more inconvenient or impossible to find. The watchlist has disappeared and been sort of broken down across multiple sections so there is no more overview. No idea how to manage the watchlist. Watchlist shortcut only shows 2 items and you can select which and selecting it doesn’t take you to a proper overview. 

The converter feature has now been hidden away under a menu in the accounts screen. 

All the other features from the favorites button have been removed or dispersed across the app into hidden places never to be seen again.
