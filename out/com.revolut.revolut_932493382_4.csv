I’m glad it has the option to keep the old interface, but please, Revolut team, take some more time to actually research if the users like it. From the brand perspective, I feel like you’re losing it. All-caps text is now reminiscent of your rival “Wise.” It feels like you’re trying to be like them, but actually you had a great sense of identity before, it stood out. Also :) Why purple all of the sudden? The bank money interface should stay familiar and recognizable, moderately strict; I believe blue is the standard for a reason. You might have been a little too quick, that’s how it feels like. Some interface elements of the new design don’t align and don’t feel cohesive—like action buttons.

10487575166,FredZ0009,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1318360376,10.0.1,1,Better options than Revolut,I use Wise all the time and never have a problem. Revolut on the other hand is a mess. I don’t trust it one bit to get my transactions right. Can’t link my major account and there is no one to help me. Customer service is almost nonexistent. I have withdrawn all my funds and will soon close my account. With Revolut there is no there there. UPDATE: Wow. Just closed my crappy account and even that was a difficult task. It’s not worth it people. If you go with Revolut be prepared for zero customer service. You’re on your own so you better hope you have no problems. UPDATE: Just deleted the app from my phone. Felt good. Just glad I never could transfer funds to Revolut so I didn’t have issues getting my money back.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-18T01:51:32-07:00
10487406658,Nickname094820472,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id470916903,10.0.1,1,"Trash company, trash customer service",I have been trying to get a transfer through to pay my rent for over three weeks now. You cannot get in contact with anyone who knows what they are talking about. All you can do is chat with some frontline dumb worker that has no idea what is going on. They keep dragging me on claiming “someone is working on it” every day with no meaningful updates. I eventually had to take my business elsewhere. NEVER use this company if you want your money in trusted hands.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-18T00:31:33-07:00
