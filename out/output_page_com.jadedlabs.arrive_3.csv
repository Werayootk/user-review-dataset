When I started seeing the option to stay updated with arrive after checkout on online stores I decided to download it and it’s been a go to every day since. Basically you log in with your email you like to make orders with on the app and it will filter out all your emails and will only show your online orders that have tracking information. it will show you a updated tracking status with a transit map status as well, it shows what’s happening with your order as it’s updated without going to your email and searching every time. Very convenient if you're the type who likes to know exactly when your packages are shipped and updated.

You literally connect your email(s) account(s) to it and it pulls info from there (shipment notification, emails) and puts all the information in one spot for you! 
It saves you from having to search for the email that has all the information, from things you ordered, etc. 

⭐️ I only give 4 stars because I wish it would allow other email providers other than just gmail. 
I have Gmail email addresses AND yahoo. I also use Microsoft email from time to time. 
So that’s my BIGGEST problem with this app. Which isn’t huge, but it would be 1000% convenient if you would allow Yahoo(and other email) email accounts to be added so I/everyone could track through those email accounts as well! 

ALSO!! Every now and then, it’s a little behind on the updates from USPS, UPS or FEDEX. 
I have all of those apps and sometimes I’ll get a new shipping notification from one of the above, before Arrive gives me the notification. Or sometimes USPS (for example) will give me a new update on my shipment, long before Arrive ever reports any changes. 
IF this happens, Arrive will eventually update and give me the notification of a change, but it just kind of drags on the notifications/updates from time to time. 
That’s not a huge deal, but I thought y’all might want to know in case it were something you would like to fix!

I can look at status on carrier website and have more updates than this app. Even refreshing the app or the package the updates don’t come through for hours. You can’t edit a carrier either so packages that go from ups to USPS require you to delete the package and re add it under the new carrier. 

Edit: tried to give this app another chance and still not change. To add my list, there’s no estimated arrival date! What is the point of knowing my package is in my state if I don’t know when it will be delivered? Often times packages get held up due to smart post so I can never assume that just because it’s local that it will be delivered in a timely fashion. What’s the point of the app if I have to copy and paste the shipping into the carrier website for an estimated delivery date?

The UI is cluttered. It often missing tracking info from emails. Gives less details than similar apps.

Of course it was not delivered, and today the app tells me it's going to be delivered today. It is not, because there is no post office delivery today.

My app automatically updated without me wanting it to, and now they’re all progress bars. Why? This is horrible and not helpful at all.

So far I am using this for about a week and it’s a good app that gives you visual updates in one place rather than having to go and track your packages in several different apps, websites, shippers, etc. 

Would highly recommend this app. Looking forward to discovery more features as I use it more often. 

Cool feature is you can just copy a tracking number and once you keep into the homepage of the app, a pop-up will show that it detects new tracking information. Simply, hit the pop-up and it will track the carrier for you. 

The only thing I have a problem with is know what to title the item being tracked. I have so many different merchandise that I lose track of what is being shipped per each tracking number. So it is a little difficult unless the merchant you purchase from has Arrive integrated with their site, then it will show you the actual items being shipped.

7060753387,icecoldtears4444,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id76006837,2.19.0,1,Not as amazing as others claim. Better options available.,"At first, this tracking app seemed to do its job well. Then I realized that it doesn’t actually work well for deliveries that aren’t your typical, simple, USPS/FedEx/UPS delivery for a couple of reasons (if you have any international shipment, this app seems pretty useless). They do not provide details as to where your package is, and what is happening with your package along the way. They will simply state that it arrived somewhere or departed somewhere. If, during the shipping process, the shipper says that the package has been ‘delivered’ to one of the shippers intermediate locations, the app will mark the package as delivered to you, when it obviously hasn’t been, and stop tracking the shipment. They obviously have some kind of crappy programming that is set up to say the package is delivered anytime the word ‘delivered’ is used. 

At this point, I downloaded another shipment tracking app to compare experiences. The other app was able to provide me clear details about my shipment at every step along the shipment route. It is clear that this app is just terribly developed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-03T07:23:19-07:00

All of my package shipping info in one place! They Arrive app would “grab” the shipping information from my email for most of my packages. If it didn’t grab the info, I could go into the app and it would search my emails for shipping info. When I looked at the Arrive app I could see the sender and the arrival date. It was seriously so user friendly and easy to use. The Arrive app just updated to Shop and it’s so disappointing! There are multiple notifications for the same package and the notifications don’t show the sender of package. Since the sender can’t be seen on the main screen I need to go into the package notification, find the tracking number and then find the sender from the shipping website. This is no easier or convenient than searching from my email. With the Arrive app, when a package arrived I could swipe left to archive the notification. This is no longer an option with Shop. So disappointed with the “update”. I will be deleting the shop app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-02T14:30:07-07:00

No more  having to switch back and forth between email track package links especially if you have multiple items coming. Brilliant app and works great. 
  The only con I found so far is that sometimes you have to choose the delivery carrier out of a suggested list. If the app knows which carrier it might be by making the suggestion in the first place, I feel like it wouldn’t be too hard to let it finish making the choice for you. 
  Even if they don’t fix that, the app works great and that little con isn’t a deal breaker. Just some creative feedback.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-17T10:43:57-07:00

Per doctors advice I stopped all different kinds of food and drinks, with no avail. Until I decided to go off coffee, and use Teechino. You probably think I am full of what makes the grass grow, but honestly my stomach has stopped hurting, not anywhere as much gas as prior, and my gastrointestinal issues have gone away. I will say every once and awhile I will have a decaf coffee, but I really missed my Teechino. I say give it a try, see what flavors floats your boat, then try drinking that without coffee.

This app is really awesome.  But the name change is bad.  Arrive was an perfect name for the app.  I am not sure if they got bought out or something but they should have stuck w arrive.  Also the GPS map tracking needs some work. After delivery if you open the map it should show each place your package was with a line between each place and the final destination.  Also it should show in real time where the package is at any given time.

Yes, ads are to “help you shop” from websites you’ve already purchased from but that’s a pain. If I wanted advertising I would have gone elsewhere. I sent a message through the Shop contact form to ask about this issue (it is extremely hard to figure out how to contact Shop directly without going through social media) and the server was down.

The idea has so much potential to help small businesses on the Shopify platform, but it feels too much like a walled garden and a money grab.

Both Deliveries and Parcel (Parcel first and Deliveries 2 mins later) tell me they had arrived. This was three hours ago. Arrive has yet to alert me. This isn’t the first time. Since this was a “multi hop” trip for these items the other two tracking apps where always two to four hours ahead of what Arrive would say.

By agreeing to give it access to scan your emails you’re also gifting Arrive the following:
It can change your name and send-from address (ie it can spoof your email). It can change your POP and IMAP settings meaning they can redirect your outgoing mail without you knowing. The POP settings means they can remote scrape your email on their own servers.
Arrive is a great idea but it requires WAY too much access to your gmail account to be worth the risk. All it should require is read access. To give it all the other things is a privacy nightmare. 
The help online says it can be used without being connected to an email account for scanning, but during setup you’ll discover it can’t. You either give it full access to your gmail, or you don’t use it at all. 
If you’re even faintly concerned about your email security, you’d be wise to steer well clear of this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-07T15:11:27-07:00

I paid for 3-5 day shipping. The package didn’t get to post office until the 4th day it was supposed to be on its way. I then contacted this company at least 3 times via email, prob more to find out what was going on cause the tracking kept saying it was still sitting at post office and hadn’t even been shipped yet. I asked the company through email to cancel the order due to the fact that the package wasn’t even taken to a post office until 4th day of shipping on its way to me, which it wasn’t. No word back from company after multiple emails. Package gets to me almost 3 weeks later, guess what??? It wasn’t what I even ordered!!!!! They sent me glitter gray ones!!!!! I ordered plain gray. My son was so let down. Thanks to this company. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Big disappointment for this company and I won’t be purchasing anything else because of how it was handled, which was just to ignore the customer!! Unfair and not right.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-14T08:49:08-07:00
