I previously had simple and did think monzo was similar and a good replacement. I don‚Äôt like that the notifications don‚Äôt tell you your current balance, but ok.  \nHowever, recently I placed an Amazon order for $300, that I then canceled. Amazon does what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúpending authorization‚Äù. Monzo is still holding onto the funds from that transaction, and this was 2 weeks ago. I‚Äôve contacted Amazon, and they confirmed the pending authorization was canceled and it‚Äôs up to the bank to make the funds available. Monzo says it‚Äôs up to Amazon; but I‚Äôve never had this problem before, typically I receive a refund within a day or two. \nI also had a grocery pick up order, where I had accidentally put the wrong billing address, and it showed as declined. However the funds were still removed from my account, even though it says ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù right next to the transaction. I had to order again, essentially paying twice. I really don‚Äôt like not having access to my funds, this isn‚Äôt a problem I‚Äôve ever had before. 2 weeks is too long to be holding onto money. I suppose that‚Äôs what you get for being in the US using a bank that originated in the UK. \nI never write reviews, but I‚Äôm so annoyed I just had to. I‚Äôll be switching banks.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-10T13:00:42-07:00"},{"id":"9778747562","userName":"tack bes","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1147250504","version":"5.17.0","score":4,"title":"Needs better support","text":"This bank is nice. The app itself is pretty nice. I like the features that comes with it. No problems in that department. The main issue is communication with customer service and getting access to your account again. I‚Äôve been having issues logging in because I don‚Äôt have access to my email account. In my opinion that should be a top priority as well as other things. It has taken me since March 23rd (it‚Äôs now April 1st) to get things in motion. The first time I reached out, they never responded back. After repeatedly sending them the information they‚Äôve requested‚Ä¶Finally after going back and forth for 24 hours and being ‚Äútransferred ‚Äú to another specialist, they let me know to contact US support. LOL. So that‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm at. Emailing the ‚ÄúUS‚Äù support team and starting over. So hopefully it doesn‚Äôt take a week for them to update my email address so I can log into my account.\n\n**Update** they closed my account. I jumped through hoops just to have my account closed lol. Hopefully they don‚Äôt take months to give me my funds in my account. \n\nJust a note: add another way to verify your account! Add a pass phrase or give your users another option with using their verified phone number to get the access code! That should help things run more efficiently.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1052238659&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-04-02T05:47:34-07:00"},{"id":"8605290656","userName":"cntmpltvno1","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1395080923","version":"4.28.0","score":1,"title":"DO NOT USE","text":"They froze my account without cause and refuse to give me access to my money.
