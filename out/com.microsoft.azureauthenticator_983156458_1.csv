I have been an avid and strong supporter of Microsoft for several years; first using it in the United States Navy then School and finally in the professional world, but this app and lack of support is ready to have me retract every good thing I have ever said about the company! I am having an issuing authenticating an account at my school. It is most likely the Schools fault. That being said there is no way to verify this as it is impossible to talk to a Microsoft representative over the phone. It is impossible to access support over chat without logging in to your account! I understand there are millions of problems every single day and it would be difficult for the company to address every single one, but don’t scale your company to the level that exceeds the volume of problems you are willing to address. Money hungry tech companies where CEO’s accumulate billions can’t expend the millions to outsource there trouble shooting it’s despicable and for the first time ever I am taking the time to rate an app and boy is this one a doozie.
