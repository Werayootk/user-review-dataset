This wasn‚Äôt the issue few releases back.\nWith the latest release, I had 11 tabs before the installation of latest version, and not I have 2. Rest of them mysteriously disappeared.\nSeems like with each new release, a perfectly ok working app is getting worse n worse.\nI truly believe new version releases are not required all the time just to keep an app going, especially if they are going to introduce bugs and other issues for the users. Let the app be, unless the developer have really something that they want to introduce.\nOtherwise, they‚Äôll start to lose users just because they released a new version with more bugs than the bug-fixes.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-11-01T10:34:01-07:00"},{"id":"7834440371","userName":"CaseyUndercoverAsSarah","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1196098038","version":"178.0","score":2,"title":"It's getting worse tbh","text":"I have used this app for a while instead of safari because I just trust google more. But recently its been hiccuping and I can't stand it. One thing is that it won't let me change my picture. I don't know why and I want it changed because its an old picture of me. I will click on the icon and I will tap the camera on the profile picture and it will say \"you can't change this profile picture from this account\" but the problem is I have before. Also I've had this song stuck in my head so I tried to use the \"find song\" feature on the app and when I tap on it the dots will show up for a few seconds, like its trying to find the song, then it will go back to the home page. It is getting really annoying and I'm about ready to quit using the app (even though I liked using it) if these problems continue.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-09-22T14:52:22-07:00"},{"id":"8505066594","userName":"NovaWolf18","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1276961824","version":"204.1","score":1,"title":"Stay Away From Google","text":"They‚Äôre growing too big for their own good. They act like they have a right to shove all of their content and whatever else they decide is a good idea into your face. And no, you can‚Äôt manage what they notify you about easily. You dared to search for a sports team? Clearly you want to receive game recap scores all the time about them, with no way to turn them off! There used to be a simple way, but they updated that out. It‚Äôs no longer there. Clearly, just holding on the notifications you don‚Äôt want and turning them off that way was too convenient for users, and led to too much getting turned off that google didn‚Äôt want. Now I‚Äôm stuck choosing between getting notifications I actually want to hear about while also getting something I literally never asked for, or no notifications at all. Such a great system, fantastic evidence that the company cares about your interests, and not theirs.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-28T06:53:56-07:00"},{"id":"8873852417","userName":"Niccimo","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id23576577","version":"219.0","score":2,"title":"Issues with tabs","text":"I‚Äôve been using this app for years as my primary search engine. I even recently noticed a feature where you can save recipes to ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù, which is nice. The feature I use the most, however, has been an increasing source of frustration: tabs.\n\nI keep tabs open so I can return to them at a later date. The delete tabs setting is on ‚Äònever‚Äô so that my tabs never disappear. Yet today, when I opened the app, all of my tabs were gone. And there‚Äôs no easy way to restore them. I‚Äôd have to comb through my search history and go off of memory. I‚Äôm ready to discard this app in favor of the chrome app, since it turns out restoring tabs is pretty simple for that one. Or maybe I‚Äôll just stick to Safari, which allows for a search of tabs. I don‚Äôt see that same option in this Google app. Another reason for me to stop using it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-14T10:32:22-07:00"},{"id":"8788244949","userName":"Sdhtevhssjgfx","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id500341332","version":"216.0","score":2,"title":"I‚Äôm switching to safari because of the June updates","text":"Before this month the app was fairly good for a search app but now it‚Äôs useless. At first it was hacking trouble just saving what tabs I wanted open and would delete whatever tab I just opened once I left the tab. This applies to both new tabs where I wanted to compare results and tabs I had open for a few days that I went back to frequently. Then it made the layout of websites go into a weird zoomed out format that made it so you could accidentally swipe out mid read. Lastly the reason I‚Äôve given up is because you can no longer save images. When you hold down an image now it just shows ‚Äúimage source‚Äù and ‚Äúsearch within image‚Äù neither of which I would ever use. On the off chance that you manage to go through image sources and find a saveable image it‚Äôs grainy and awful quality.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-18T21:04:06-07:00"},{"id":"10598754968","userName":"RJK_Senior","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id398389558","version":"290.0","score":1,"title":"You totally destroyed this app overnight","text":"When my wife and I woke up this morning and overnight Google totally destroyed this app for what we use it for.
