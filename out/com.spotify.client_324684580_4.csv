I can't use it there's no way to get off of the picture it showed me the only way you can get off of it is if you sign it or get a account.

One of, if not the best music app I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of using. I‚Äôve had no ads.

Now, I have a singular issue. When I‚Äôm making a playlist and I accidentally add one and I want to rearrange it, I‚Äôm better off just making a new playlist entirely. You can‚Äôt take a song and move it down, or up the list to my knowledge. Leaving me having to remove the song entirely and then add it back later, which is annoying, time consuming, and just overall a pain. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôd be hard to fix.

The pros of this app are that the large variety of songs and artist, which is spectacular! I also enjoy listening the fact that you can save as many songs as you'd like.

Then, there's also the fact that unsaved songs of yours can randomly start playing, which is great for discovering some new songs and artist, but gets irritating when I want to listen to my songs.

Worse then that, occasionally it will recommend songs that I‚Äôd rather the crowd I‚Äôm with currently not hear for a variety of reasons. Ultimately, you can no longer use the playlist- possibly until you get another set of skips. While I understand there has to be some motive for app users to buy premium and spend money, but I feel this makes it so those who are unable to get that experience will deter future costumers.

The ONLY reason I am not giving this app 5 stars is the fact that that application has gotten political recently, especially since the Joe Rogan podcasts were added.

I don‚Äôt know for how long, but I hope it never, ever, EVER comes back because ain‚Äôt NOBODY needs that in their life. I‚Äôll let my review of that travesty stay up‚Ä¶

Is awful. Soooo bad. It‚Äôs like they took the positive notes of every focus group and did the exact opposite. It‚Äôs a giant wall of user-hating blah that refuses to be intuitive or helpful or anything that even remotely resembles an app I would ever willingly use EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WHAT I USE FOR ALL OF MY MUSIC LISTENING ACTIVITIES!!! It would have cost them so much less to just have a hand flipping me off where the tip of the finger stays in place as the rest of the finger stretches endlessly as you hopelessly scroll for ANYTHING that‚Äôs better than this grotesque display of user interface incompetence. This is bad and all the devs behind it should feel bad. Because they ruined it. Like a bunch of ruiners. ‚Ä¶blink twice if the execs made you do this, devs! IT WOULD EXPLAIN SO MUCH!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-07T13:58:52-07:00

Songs are no longer organized to their own section, and gone is the alphabet scroll bar. I used to enjoy scrolling through and finding whatever struck my fancy, but the new update forces liked songs into a playlist which, understandably, functions as a playlist. This makes it difficult to get to the lower sections, and either forces the user to just shuffle it, know all the songs by heart, or settle for playing the upper most songs without considerable effort.

A second gripe- no longer able to search my artists or albums. Artists are only the ones followed, but if I want to play songs only by a certain artist, I‚Äôve yet to find a way to be able to short of making another playlist. Album‚Äôs too are no longer listed, it seems to be only the ones where the user follows the artist who made the album in question.

The new podcast look is no problem, and the division of music and podcasts into two adjacent sections is a pretty good play. However, not if it forces the music section to be less user friendly and in turn force it to be less functional.

If the new and old versions could be married somehow, where music is just as navigable, that‚Äôd be great. But as it currently stands, this new update seems to have forced up a new feature and the expense of some very practical features, and it‚Äôs a bummer the app is no longer quite as user friendly.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-06-25T08:01:13-07:00

So I can't play whatever I want on an app on my phone without paying premium?? It'd be tight if I can play whatever I want on my phone. Least let me play my playlists without discovering ""new"" songs that I don't give a crap about. If you force me to shuffle my music and play songs I don't want at least don't make the app free. It's a huge turn off to get a free app only to not really enjoy the app unless you pay premium which is a lot for a mobile app when I can with the same app play whatever I like on my iPad and computer so why can't it be the same for mobile. I recommend it for computer and iPad but for mobile I'd pass unless there is a way for me to play my music even if it's just shuffling without playing music I don't want. Why do this to us who don't want to pay for premium for mobile. I don't really care for music that's ""discovering"". I just want the music in my library. I don't even mind the ads. I'll stick to pandora for discovering new music.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-16T19:11:28-07:00

Some changes were annoying but quickly adapted to. But all this extra stuff with the UI- not cool. Nowhere close to convenient. Pls stop trying to fix what isn‚Äôt broken. Who wants to take extra steps to add to their Liked list and playlists in general? The simple swipe to like and add to Liked Playlist was just fine. Ugh whatever I‚Äôm just annoyed with all of this unnecessary stuff. Also‚Ä¶ This whole new or suggestive algorithm thing or whatever it is- is insanely random, inconsistent, not even close to my tastes (after giving it a few tries). Usually not even what I last listened to; nor the same or close genre; nor what I‚Äôm in the mood for. Like ever. Also searching for music playlist categories is nothing like it used to be. Most of the playlists have the same songs and catered to a much younger demographic. Discovering new music and/or just letting the app do its thing was never this off.
