Spotify also took down one of my favorite podcasts with no warning and wouldn’t tell them why until a bunch of angry people started calling them out on social media. Then the podcast was put back up, and they were never told why it was taken down. A multi-year catalog of episodes was gone and they never accepted responsibility. Some episodes are still missing, but no copyright issue was ever revealed or any other answer.
