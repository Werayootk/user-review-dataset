11109802007,William Ross Alexander,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id119364198,8.9.19,4,Please allow people to remove content,"I have used the Spotify app for years now, and I mostly love it, except for the fact that I cannot remove something from my home screen or podcast section. For example, if I listen to a podcast for even 5 minutes and decide it isn’t for me, that podcast shows up under podcasts forever. There is no way to permanently purge it from ever showing anywhere on Spotify, which is incredibly annoying to me. If I know I’m not interested, I don’t want to keep seeing it. The same is true for music. I understand there are limited ways that someone can keep listened-to content from appearing in specific places on Spotify, but that isn't enough. I think that as a paying member, I should have control over what I see. The fact that Spotify continues to show content that I’ve listened to that I don’t want to get back in and doesn’t let me start from a clean slate or even remove the content I don’t want to see has me seriously debating whether I press play on things I’m unsure or about. Sometimes, I even go into Apple Podcasts to listen instead because there is that level of control. Someone at Spotify, please hear my feedback and make some tweaks so we can have the ability to adjust what appears on our home tabs and anywhere else!  🙏",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-04-01T07:26:28-07:00
