I listen to this song frequently and still, every single time, my music STOPS so YT can alert me, 20yo, that what I'm listening to pertains to self harm and depression. It comes down to a safety issue when used with car play, as it cannot be bypassed until the phone is turned on and the ""continue"" option is chosen.

The arrow does not always signify if it is removed or added to a playlist. It sometimes won't even be in a playlist it says the video was in.

Before, the comment section was an extra section at the bottom of the page, and it now is a openable “pop up” at the top of the recommended videos. It is much more unportable to use this way. 

The recommended videos have also become much bigger and more difficult to slide through, and as a person that tends to know right away what kind of videos I want to watch based by the title, the enlarged preview short clips and the reduced title size has become more uncomfortable to use.

When I’m trying to use a sound for a short it will only let me have a certain amount of seconds to use, and I cannot change the amount of time it gives me.

Tobacco recipes—food made with tobacco—clearly unhealthy it should not be advocated or even ambiguously exposed. 
i don’t want to go down the list, but your concerns are not clear aside from money, same as regular television, and for that you must receive less than 4stars. 
But you do have lots of otherwise unavailable content, if you had a different approach, maybe a filtered version, or a way to enter into only learning and documentaries, not by thumbnail, but a way to avoid trolling and views/subscribes fishermen/women, you know, Wikipedia went through its years where controversial and shocking content was overwhelming serious contributors, they adddressed it, i expect you can do it that way, they now have “locked”pages to avoid this—we needn’t continue the US customary tradition of profiting from an unneeded, instigated controversy.
