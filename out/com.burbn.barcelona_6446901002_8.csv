--

Its like Twitter... only its called Threads. The problem is that I dont see what void its trying to fill, or what problem its trying to solve, other than being another Twitter ""killer"" that is going to solve all the perceived non existent problems of Twitter (Remember when everyone was all excited over the Facebook Killers known as either Google Plus or Diaspora?). I also don't really see how it heightens or enhances instagram, either. Instagram is for all intents well laid out despite the fact that you cant have a chronological feed that shows you everyone you follow (which it would be nice to scroll through my followers, and not my top interactions + whatever else instagram's algorithm tosses up). Btw, thanks for not allowing me to delete Threads unless I delete my Insta, there is simply no reason for that much tie-in. Regardless now I have a silly @ like symbol on my profile that redirects to a defunct threads link, so good job for useless features. Lastly, in regards to people complaining about toxicity on Twitter as a reason for this app to exist, I would suggest that Twitter is neither toxic or pure, but that most have no clue how go actually use it, as all algorithms are a result of what you, the user, put into it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-22T19:47:35-07:00
