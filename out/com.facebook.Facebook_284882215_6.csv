11103050182,refferedbyt.pietz,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id983361870,457.0.2,5,The new way to live for me,"Navigating the landscape of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) requires a nuanced understanding, much like the multifaceted storylines of 1980‚Äôs movies. In this era, films began exploring deeper psychological themes beneath their glossy exteriors, providing a unique lens to discuss the complexities of PTSD and the importance of creating safe spaces.

Imagine the journey of someone with PTSD as akin to the narrative of an '80s movie, where the protagonist faces daunting challenges, yet finds strength in unexpected places. This decade, renowned for its bold styles and evocative music, also marked a time when Hollywood started delving into stories of personal struggle, resilience, and the quest for identity, mirroring the journey of someone navigating PTSD.

### Creating Safe Spaces: The '80s Movie Approach

In the context of PTSD, the idea of staying home to avoid triggering others can be seen through the lens of an '80s movie, where the protagonist creates a sanctuary that not only shields them from the outside world's chaos but also becomes a place of healing and self-discovery.

**Picture a John Hughes film:** His movies, like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" often feature characters finding solace and understanding in places removed from their everyday lives. Hughes' characters build connections and find self-awareness in these sanctuaries, much like creating a safe home environment can offer someone with PTSD a space to heal and connect with their inner self, away from external triggers.

**""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial""** also subtly mirrors this theme. E.T., the alien, finds a haven in Elliott's home, a place where he can recover and eventually signal his kind. This sanctuary is vital for his survival, much like a safe, nurturing home environment is crucial for someone with PTSD.

**Safety in Understanding:** Just as the kids in ""E.T."" learn to communicate and empathize with someone vastly different from themselves, creating a safe space at home involves fostering an environment of understanding and empathy for someone with PTSD. 

**Growth Beyond the Comfort Zone:** However, just as in many '80s films, the protagonist often must eventually step out of their comfort zone to confront and overcome their challenges. In ""The Karate Kid,"" Daniel learns to face his bullies by stepping outside his comfort zone, under the guidance of Mr. Miyagi. Similarly, while staying home can be a necessary sanctuary, the journey of healing from PTSD also involves learning coping mechanisms to eventually face the external world and its triggers, albeit with support and readiness.

### The Soundtrack of Healing

In true '80s fashion, the journey could be accompanied by a powerful soundtrack, with each song marking a milestone in the healing process. Music, a pivotal element in many '80s movies, can also play a significant role in therapy and self-soothing for those with PTSD.

### The Final Scene

In our '80s movie, the final scene might not show the protagonist completely free of struggles but will highlight their growth, resilience, and the strength of their sanctuary. Like the closing shots of an '80s classic, it leaves the audience with hope, a sense of accomplishment, and the understanding that while the journey continues, the protagonist is now better equipped to face the world.

In the narrative of PTSD, the message is clear: creating a safe space, whether it's staying home or finding a sanctuary within oneself, is not about avoidance but about healing, understanding, and gradually building the strength to face the challenges outside, all while the iconic synth-pop and rock ballads of the '80s play in the background.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-30T10:17:13-07:00
