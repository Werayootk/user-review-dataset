On an off day I will get a random quick add from different strangers. (Maybe like 7 times in all) they would send a picture of an attractive girl and ask that you send money to them.

First know internet safety. If it‚Äôs too good to be true there‚Äôs probably a reason. If you are unsure about an identity ask for a selfie of them with 3 fingers up. This will weed out the real and the fakes.

But the point of my concern, is that for the past 4 times I have caught them in their own game both Snapchat and the catfish. First the catfish will do anything to remain on script, even if you catch them in a lie, (Maybe ai generated) Second, when I report these accounts through Snapchat, for more times then not there is ‚Äúthere is nothing wrong with the profile‚Äù. Okay use ai to match all 3 photos, identical person, extensive scammers.

Just a reminder; be safe out there. If things do not change I will make a YouTube video to document and share my findings with not only Snapchat but the world.

11056158200,Jesse Clutter,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id363120405,12.77.0.42,1,Societies Downfall,"I tried this app again 3-4 years after I initially deleted it. I wanted to use it for my business and I also did a social experiment for myself.

Keep in mind if you let your kids raise themselves on the phone, you‚Äôre letting them easy access to drug dealers, weapon dealers, OnlyFans girls, hookups etc. It takes no effort whatsoever to hit add on quick add and find hundreds of people like that. I thought they were bots. It isn‚Äôt as friendly as it might appear. For parents this is an issue for you. I‚Äôm stating the obvious of the internet itself. You will encounter this regardless of what you do. 

So if you see this let your child have a normal childhood. 4 year olds with Snap is not NORMAL!!!

There‚Äôs no setting to disable being put in a groupchat so if you have a bunch of these people added they will gather a lot of people and force content you don‚Äôt want to see.

There is no age filter where you can auto deny requests from a certain age group and since sending pictures is normalized (I don‚Äôt do it) but most people do is opening a door to potential predators easily.

I‚Äôm assuming screenshots and screen-recording was moved to Snapchat Plus, if I‚Äôm wrong please correct me. If I‚Äôm correct this used to be a free feature. Who would support that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£ I genuinely don‚Äôt see the appeal of this app

Our generation (Z) let this app ruin some part of the population due to instant gratification and stimulation. I remember deleting it and in school everybody looks sucked into it. YOU‚ÄôRE MOST LIKELY NOT GOING TO SEE 99% OF THESE PEOPLE EVER AGAIN!

The average ‚Äòwyll‚Äô warrior has been trained to ask people what they look like without providing anything whatsoever and it‚Äôs normalized. Even if I don‚Äôt care what they look like it‚Äôs creepy that they have developed the pride to do that. Most of your daughters have lists of guys and since they have no intentions to probably be with them it‚Äôs to soothe their ego. 

Since I‚Äôm relatively good looking (so I‚Äôve been told) I‚Äôve been just getting access to what most of y‚Äôall‚Äôs daughters are doing and I want no piece of it ü§£ I want a wife

It‚Äôs also a problem in society on the guys side as well because they let them have that and devalue themselves to such a degree they‚Äôre willing to sell their soul for a one night stands. Multiplying the mentality.

You‚Äôll find other ‚Äúmen‚Äù on here hating on each-other like it‚Äôs some girl gossip party. We‚Äôre supposed to uplift each-other however you will most likely not find it. They realize life is a competition but instead of surpassing your own limits you must limit others to make it easier for yourself. Bunch of clowns.

The biggest ones are the ones with Snapchat Plus, not only can they be a hater they have stalker privileges too and act is if they‚Äôre better for it üò≠

It screams look at me I paid extra for no reason for a company that does nothing for me. It‚Äôs not like a blue checkmark so I don‚Äôt see any appeal to it.

Has everybody gotten to the point where it‚Äôs a chore to type ‚ÄúWyd‚Äù? Like come on, you guys treat it as a chore and genuinely don‚Äôt care. What you doing? Is a real sentence. If you don‚Äôt genuinely care, just don‚Äôt say anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

People pleasing as it‚Äôs best and instant information has ruined the expectations of daily life because they‚Äôre completely clueless.
