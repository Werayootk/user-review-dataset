Like everyone else in this world this app is how everyone on the planet communicates. Nobody uses text messages anymore. This is the app used to communicate. In fact, if you don’t have it people look at you as if you’re an alien of some sort. Everyone from young to old has this app nowadays. But where it goes wrong is with the permanent bans. I have never ever posted anything bad or illegal in my entire life. Not once. I posted CBD which is totally legal. And it wasn’t even me selling the CBD or anything like that. And I was permanently banned. Without warnings or strikes or anything. My entire account that had my entire life on it. Pictures. People I’ve known forever. Gone. Without cause or explanation. No support team to help me. Nobody to talk to. No appeal to be made. It’s unfair that people can post nude pictures of themselves. Or pictures of their body and not have anything happen. Or post illegal substances that they’re selling and not get into trouble. But me, with a clean slate. Never had a strike. Never did anything wrong on the app in my life gets banned. Fix it.

Every time the light fades from your phone, the voice clip you’re currently recording is completely lost even if it was 5 min long. Countless times I have given up trying to record something because of it. Been going on for years and I’m surprised Snapchat doesn’t even care to fix the issue. Also, when you upload several posts, many times it stops uploading the rest of your story and you lose the entire story. Imagine being an influencer and all your snaps get lost because it won’t upload and it won’t let you save them either. Just says “uploading 0%” for each snap that it didn’t feel like uploading and you will never ever get them back if you hadn’t saved them prior.

When the app first came to the attention of teenagers my granddaughters installed it on my phone. We snap EVERY day. Multiple times a day. It has been our medium for conversations since jr high and they are adults now with families of their own. Snap is still the medium for our conversations. Our streaks have been a big deal. I had a stroke several years ago. The girls were at the hospital with me. They took my phone and maintained my streaks until I was able to do it again. One granddaughter lived in an area for a time with no cell service or internet. Every day she drove to an area of service to maintain her streaks. Three times now snap has ended our streak and charged us money to restore it. Once we just let it go. It has happened a couple of times over the years. But again we talk via snap every day. The last three times they have ended our streak we have record of the number of back and forth snaps for each day. This is typical bait and switch marketing. I hate it. I had such faith in this medium. It had let me feel safe about the kids lives for years. It’s not that anymore. We need an honest medium again.

I don’t appreciate having an AI that automatically has access to my stories and my information - I think it’s bizarre and makes me wonder why Snapchat wants to monitor me in that way? I honestly don’t understand not being able to remove it, at the very least please allow all users to fully disable the AI feature. I also feel like adding the AI feature is highly irresponsible. Whether it’s intended for kids or not, there are TONS of children that use Snapchat. It’s dangerous and invasive and just might be the reason I delete Snapchat after using it for over ten years.

I do love the basic features they offer: sending photos to friends, filters, best friends list , stories, etc.  although within the past couple years it seems like every new update is just unnecessary. The only one have actually enjoyed is the front facing flash selection. But imo there’s no need for maps or a discover page, spotlight page of people I don’t even know, and seriously why did they make exporting photos and videos so much harder now? Pleaseee make it simpler. For the past few months I’ve had to click edit, share/export, then save to camera roll. It just shouldn’t be under edit, why did we take away the export button on the first screen showing the photo. Another request I have is to make the subscriptions and discover page smaller or further down and have the friends stories larger because that’s who we’re actually in the app for.

another problem i have w snap is that they took the mini games away (old news ik im js still mad 😔) the mini games were also one of my favorite things ab the app since i could play competitive, fun games with my friends on my favorite app. but, ofc snapchats developers dont want people to use their app, so they took it away.

A current trend the app is doing since they can’t admit to their foolish mistakes. This app does not care about you but would rather kick you off due to a new update. This past week thousands of users were permanently blocked off Snapchat. All users explaining how they did nothing wrong and everything is gone as well their friends. I’m going to cut to the chase. Tiktok is a great app to call people out and spread awareness. Two good things, Snapchat is on tiktok and most people have tiktok. So what I'm saying is everyone who got booted needs to make a video stating their case of what happened to them and use the hashtag #snapchatban in the description as well as tagging Snapchat. With enough posts there is bound to be one that goes viral therefore making the hashtag viral. With thousands of people who are angry, Snapchat will have to respond or else they face being cancelled.

There are a couple things that i dont like about snapchat is how there are these predators on there looking for children to do nudes and bad things on the internet and i like how you can report the photos and chats its just i really want the kids and teens on snap to be careful and talk to the people you know cause some people arent what you think. There is another thing i wanted to mention that i dont like is when you want to post a vid in your story but the time limit is only 1 minute. I think the limit should be around 3-5 minutes because some people like to post tiktoks on their story and tiktoks can be longer than a minute sometimes so its very tricky to add something like that.

Who can’t forget the pretty cool filters of course :) I do think that a feature where we can “airdrop” memories to someone near by or just to a person you select would be cool. Instead of it going on our phone camera roll it would instead go into one’s Snapchat memories! I think this would be an awesome update because there’s people out there who #1 have 2 accounts such as me, and would like to transfer memories to the other account.

I don’t understand why snapchat doesn’t take action to this, locking, deleting, logging people out, etc; on people who didn’t do anything, when they should be doing this on bots. other than that I don’t really have other problems w this app, I just think yall should take it slow with the updates. so goodbye",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-06T06:01:33-07:00

I use it to chat with my friends, and often to just use the funny filters. But what I don’t like is the Ai. No one asked for it and it gives off a bad start. I asked it if it had a mom and it said “yes she’s great!” Or something similar to that response. And I asked “what’s your moms name?” And it said “I’m sorry i don’t have a mom, is there anything else you’d like to chat about?” Or something. That’s a bit creepy considering it’s supposed to be honest. I also went on a vacation and posted it on my statues/story  and it said “how’d the vacation go” when i only posted a picture of the place not even saying “I’m on vacation!”. It also doesn’t remember past conversations. It re fresh’s every 10 minutes (i don’t remember but maybe not 10 minutes i don’t know) but it definitely doesn’t remember my past conversations i had with it.

I’ve never bothered to rate snapchat before because I use like .5% of the features - I just send snaps and chats, I don’t really use filters or watch whatever it is they call their tiktoks, or share on the map or whatever else it does. I don’t feel comfortable reviewing things I haven’t experienced. But I’m irrationally angry about this AI nonsense. 

It’s not just that it’s up there all the time, it also pops up every time I type “my” in any OTHER chat. As if I’m trying to tag “MyAI” when I’m talking to people? For anyone trying to solve this, it seems like changing the name of it has helped. I picked “dumbest thing” as its new name. 

Who thought this was a good idea? I never would have agreed to allow it access if I knew I couldn’t go back. Id serenely forget about whatever new data it’s collecting just being there if it wasn’t at the top of my feed…but it is, and I can’t ignore it.

That could be grounds for not only a major lawsuit, but could and potentially should have the company shut down. It’s a complete invasion of privacy and is almost set up in a harrassing/menacing way with it being automatically pinned to the top with no way to either remove it or unpin it. It should have been an option for those who wanted it and not forced onto everyone in the app. Not to mention there are multiple screenshots of it talking about extremely innapropriate stuff, even telling one user that if he’s into kinks, he should try necrophilia.

It’s very easy to access explicit content on snapchat without having to request to follow anyone or subscribe. Another one is sex bots. In my experience in snapchat I have blocked and reported many accounts that have deemed as sexual predators, these accounts still exist and it seems snapchat lacks the discipline to take care of these issues. I know another user name that has its data stolen from snapchat and when a email was sent to the support team about this issue they insistent on keeping the compromised data.

I recently got over the fact that I can’t do anything anymore and it will never change, nothing will be the same anymore and the smile I would have every day designing it will be over from now on. Yesterday I opened the app to something even more horrible and trenching, my bitmoji looked like Kim Kardashian with 100x botox face plastic surgery. It seems like Snapchat keeps setting themselves up and making their platform worse, AND WORSE by the second. What is it next? What will it take for you guys to stop this disgrace! Don’t do this to yourselves and bring back the old Snapchat because right now this is just a bad look on you! SHAME ON YOU!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-06T17:30:37-07:00
9939934126,Sonexeral,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1444764457,12.34.0.28,4,Confusion.,"Snapchat was my favorite app for the past 5 years, and I had some of my BEST memories on the app. Not only that, but all of my first messages with various friends, and my girlfriend were on there. I consecutively used the app everyday, and had never even had an offense before. But I woke up one day a few months ago to my account being permanently locked, without any real reasoning. I tried contacting support, and sending forms, and emails. Without any replies, but that evening I had received an email.  The email stated that my account had been permanently terminated and deleted, and that there was no chance for recovery. I’ve gotten over the fact that my account is gone, but I would like to at least make a new account. Snapchat is the best app in my opinion, and I would love to have a chance to use it again. I wanted to leave this review to see if I could get any answers. Please let me know if there’s any way to fix this.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-18T07:24:40-07:00

The AI was designed to be HIDEOUS to make us mad in hopes we would open our wallets. Instead, I deleted the app. I have been using Snapchat for TWELVE YEARS, but you can no longer count my household because of your stupid greed- we all deleted the app. I will NOT accept the terms of that ugly robot. I will NEVER EVER use some stupid thing like that, all you’re trying to do is trick more children and it’s DISGUSTING. Snapchat has given themselves such a bad name I don’t even know if I’ll be able to come back once they realize their mistake and finally listen to the MILLIONS of angry users because I’m so off-put by the company. I’m thinking about going back to school for programming just to delete a direct competitor app to give the people what the ACTUALLY WANT, which was the Snapchat we had before he sold out to such a terrible corporation. Remove the nasty media, remove the dots trying to make people watch strangers spotlights (WHEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND PEOPLE DON’T USE SNAPCHAT FOR RANDOM STRANGERS), and remove the ugly and intrusive AI. In the meantime I’ll be watching out for privacy lawsuits to join.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-14T13:22:31-07:00

Some argue that considering a lower age rating, perhaps to 10, could have its merits for the following reasons:
Creative Expression: Snapchat encourages creativity through its multimedia features. Allowing younger users to join at the age of 10 might foster early exploration and expression in a creative digital space.
Family Connectivity: Snapchat offers a platform for families to stay connected through multimedia messages. Lowering the age rating could enhance family engagement, allowing younger members to share moments in a controlled environment.
Digital Literacy: A lower age rating could prompt a focus on digital literacy education for younger users. Snapchat could implement educational tools to help children understand online etiquette, privacy, and responsible use of multimedia messaging.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-01-07T00:33:34-07:00

First off Snapchat is a great concept. The creators just LOVE to clog it up & make you have a million things to accidentally click on that you DONT want to click on. So the set up of the app is UGLY & NO ONE asked for all these ridiculous extra changes it makes trying to ""update"" like no, Snapchat creators you're not updating anything you're just making its function more clogged up & ugly every single ""update"" someone invents up.
Then, their support is actually impossible to contact. If there's anything wrong with your account & you need to contact support. You would have better luck FaceTiming Betty White & her answering you from Heaven.
Oh & who cares if you pay for Snapchat plus because they still won't let you contact them to appeal anything they'll just ban you right off their little clogged up, spammy, ugly looking app.
Paying for Snapchat plus is like that DoorDash you didn't need to order. Now you're just sitting there with a bellyache, food & money gone. & you're not even happy.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-07T02:30:30-07:00
