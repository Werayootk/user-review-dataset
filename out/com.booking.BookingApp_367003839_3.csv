Although, we were here only one night, prior to a flight to Newfoundland, we could have all spent a week. The restaurants in the area are great & so reasonably priced. We ate at Di‚ÄôParma, 2 blocks away. Fantastic fresh swordfish & risotto. Great house bottles of vino for $17 USD.

The initial booking travel was mostly easy. However, every issue or communication after that was a nightmare. 
It took several attempts to address/resolve any concerns or inquiries about our upcoming trip. A lot of back n forth (most of it me sending multiple messages to get a real response-not automated) with minimal answers, that which took several days to finally get a conclusion/resolution. 
Two times we were even charged for things that we still have not received a reason or reimbursement for, even after multiple inquiries thru messages within app and emails.
First one, upon booking we were charged more than the agreed (and authorized) amount. Booking denied the additional amount charged, but my bank statement reflected otherwise. 
Second one, came after our trip. No emails or messages, but a charge to my bank account (even tho I had previously removed it from the app due to the previous charge issue). No one could give us a reason, and when I requested a refund since there was no reason, the lines of communication stopped each time we‚Äôd reach that point. I went thru this multiple times, each hitting the same dead end.

Staff is very accommodating and kind-
You're within a five minute walk of the Times Square mall which is a great place to go for food on the lower level.
also if you want to cross over where the monorail is a few blocks up there's a night Street market with tons of food and also the fancier Fahrenheit 88 mall and promenade.
Personally I like the hotel but the street that it was on was off the beaten path and it could be a little scary for women traveling alone I would not recommend it.  However I was always with my husband and never felt unsafe at any time.
they have some fun theme rooms like the Beatles room in Marilyn Monroe room or the Elvis Presley room we actually stayed in the Beatles room for the first night and it was adorable.  
Breakfast was included but I'm not much of a breakfast person so I only saw one time and it was limited.
Our favorite place was as you approach the Fahrenheit 88 mall there are some Japanese and Chinese letterings we found it on the last night and it's a massive food court with everything from Japan or Hong Kong.

One suggestion, if Bookings had its own rewards program, it would likely gain more market share as many of the chains have their own rewards programs that incentivize using their app instead.

I was also happy with how easy the app was to use. Notice I said WAS. 
Now, not so much. For some reason, I am unable to do a general city search; it wants to only search for what is closest to me. 
Most importantly, many user reviews of properties state peoples personal experiences and not specific to the amenities, facilities, staff and services. And I suspect someone has been editing out the negative comments. 
We stayed at a property three years ago with a high star rating and glowing reviews, but when we got there, it was a run down motel 50 yards from a freeway. They required a $200 deposit - even with a credit card, worn out carpeting, an AC unit that had to be beaten before it would cough out coolish air, if it blew any air at all, no hot water and spotty wi-fi. 
I have been reading reviews online and comparing those to reviews on Booking and they are not even close: 2 weeks ago people have began complaining about bedbugs and roaches at one property, while no mention of such nastiness is made on Booking where the reviews are still all positive.

Imagine arriving at the airport with 5 people for a flight that did not exist. Flight was from Rochester NY to San Diego. In order to actually get a flight I had to rent a car and drive to DC, 6 hours. Airline worked with me. Booking told me there was nothing they could do. I had the receipt, flight times‚Ä¶etc. Booking messed up. 2nd - they will not refund me for a rental car that was not picked up. We arrived late due to flight delays. Car company at the airport closed at 11:00pm. We arrived after 11:00pm. Nowhere was this made known to me and booking thought that I could just call while I was in the air. Had to rent from a different company and Booking will not refund me for the first rental when nobody from the rental company was even at the airport. Booking expected me to wait around the airport until 7:00am the following day to get the rental.

I recommend getting a train to Sevelen instead of Buchs SG which is a little further however you can always take the N400 bus to take you to Buelin at Sevelen which is a 5 min walk to the house. The bus cost us over 4 CHF to or from Buchs SG and over 2CHF to or from Sevelen.

I guess we had to either be Arab or Caucasian for him to even greet us in his Resturant. Horrible experience never would I recommend this resort to anyone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2018-02-09T03:23:44-07:00

1814878993,Solo Vagabond,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id535822289,15.2,2,Less than expected,"Location proximity to Oktoberfest was only good thing. Well the check-in staff were friendly enough. The place was dark and grungy with several lights out. My first room was okay, but missing furniture.
There were not adequate outlets either. I had to change rooms for my two night stay. This made me quite upset, as I was traveling for business and it meant leaving everything in luggage storage all the time. The luggage storage did not seem secure as it was in in an outside building and not monitored. It was also a ransacked mess. The breakfast, that I thought was included, was not. It was an okay assortment, but the breads did not seem fresh.
My second room was worse than the first. But at least it had all furniture. The bed was about the least comfortable I've been on in a while. All night long people were knocking on doors and making loud noises. Broken beer bottles in the hallway. It was just a mess.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=367003839&type=Purple%20Software,2017-09-28T06:15:27-07:00

I arrived at ~10pm family vacation driving all day. They say nkt in system it happens all the time with all 3rd party sites and sometimes gets booked under other names etc. turned us away  to find another room late night‚Ä¶meanwhile i try to contact booking both phone calls which said technical glitch and disconnected and through chat which says will be responded to within ‚Äú24 hrs‚Äù. Which i never got a response. I emailed and tried to chat 2 more times no response. I then get a charge from marriott from that site. Not happy with booking their inability to provide customer service as they say they do ‚Äú24 hrs a day‚Äù made a nightmare of a night for my family. I understand Marriott's part as well and will be contacting them also. The 1 star is for terrible actually ZERO support for me. Very unhappy. .
