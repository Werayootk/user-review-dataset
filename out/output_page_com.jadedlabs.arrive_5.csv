No more tabs in safari. 1 place to view all my tracked packages. Not only does it bring it one place but it updates just as the tracking information is update on the actual carriers website. You can also opt to be notified of updates to your tracked packages so you always know immediately when the status of your package/s change.

One feedback: the map feature is a bit useless. It takes up a lot of real estate and right now shows me what I already know: the location of where it is going to.

Shop is a middle man in these scamming events. They provide a sense of legality for scammers. Shop will never own up to being a hoarding home for scams, and will always deflect fault to scammers;  and scammers will either never respond or will have shady policies upheld by Shop. I say upheld because they allow such practices to occur extremely commonly on their site. 

Also, many have tried getting refunds through their banks. ( as suggested by shop; the only thing they suggest besides making a pointless report on their site) STAY AWAY. Keep your money. In this economy loosing money to scams is something I wish upon no one.

As far as a Review of my merchandise it was WORSE THAN THE DELIVERY!!! THE FOUR ITEMS IN MY ORDER WERE OF A VERY POOR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP!!! THE LARGE PURSE HAD ONE VERTICAL ZIPPER ON THE LEFT SIDE AND ONE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THAT WERE NONFUNCTIONAL. A ZIPPER THAT WORKED BUT NO OPENINGS.
