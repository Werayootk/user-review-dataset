I suspect this latest update furthers the work of AI, which I don‚Äôt need at all. I want Outlook to do what it has so far failed to do - improve my EMAIL service. No more junk mail, scams, phishing, and offers for dates or overseas brides. No more links with 6 lines of coding to webpages that don‚Äôt work or exist. No more video ads that block showing the content of my emails until after it‚Äôs downloaded. By the way, has anyone ever bothered to read much less purchase anything from those ads? How does unsolicited offers get my email address Microsoft after you have forced us to adopt MFA and other annoying security measures?
