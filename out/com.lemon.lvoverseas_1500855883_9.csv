1: graphs
i‚Äôve been doing some edits on the app. safe to say, its really easy to make edits and super fun with all the effects, filters, keyframes, etc. but, making an edit with only keyframes is way too hard. a simple transition can take up to an hour to succeed with no graphs. please, add graphs.

2: overlay limit
when i make edits or try animating with characters, the overlay limit can make me miss a leg or any other body part. i recommend to make the overlay limit unlimited since its way too hard having to keep exporting and all that and eventually having to use another program.

3: the lag
there‚Äôs an intense amount of lag if you add a few effects, overlays, or simple texts. and i‚Äôd really love if you fix the issue

4: off timing
i‚Äôve had this issue editing for someone a video with only subtitles, the subtitles would be on time in the app but out of the app its off time (slightly) and its very confusing. please fix this.

that‚Äôs all, thank you!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-24T09:11:29-07:00

When I went on there, the app was okay, and showed me the steps I needed to make my videos really fun/epic.

All the transitions are very cool and the stickers are amazing! You can even extract an audio FROM your video, which I like, and it‚Äôs a great app overall!

All though it is a great app, here are a few suggestions:
For audio editing, I feel like you guys can make it even better by creating a little icon that lets you create 8D audio, which makes the audio echo in a smooth and a clear way. What you can also do is add ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù sound effects. When I say that, I mean like in audio edits, it has a little sound effect that makes noises such as an echo laughter, etc.(Sorry if that doesn‚Äôt make sense) :‚Äô)

For transitions, you can add a different icon that says ‚ÄúTransition Effects‚Äù. This icon can have things such as oscillate! And with that, I feel like CapCut can be an even greater app!

Now, one last suggestion: 
For the text, maybe try and make text fonts that are much more unique.

Anyways, those are some of the suggestions I would like for your next update in the future. That is, of course if you get a new update.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-04-23T22:02:54-07:00

Is it possible that in a future update we could have a more powerful green screen filter with the chrome key? The current one is not that advanced and I still see some green and some glitches. I would even pay to have a premium version of it. I feel that this is the main thing that the app lacks. Also if there could be equalizing and white noise cancellation for audio. These things would make me love the app even more. But overall very good and thanks to the CapCut team for working hard on their updates.
