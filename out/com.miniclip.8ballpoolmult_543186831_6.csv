There are just way too many shots that have sunk the white or 8 ball when I know for a fact they shouldn’t have. I’m also confused about the “cash”, it’s pretty much pointless along with buying coins- both just used to take your money. You’re forced to up your cue AND buy new ones (even tho they were won in the boxes-which is another pointless aspect). My biggest complaint tho is that there are a few positions on the board that you simply can not make a shot within 10 seconds because your finger moves the slightest and the cue spins in circles or the like. Totally unfair, I’m sure you guys could’ve done better than that! Point is- if you like another pool game don’t waste your time with this one.

I’ve even put money in it here and there. What made me stop playing is that I’m constantly getting connection issues when there is no issue with my connection. And it happens in the middle of a game where the stakes are high. I can be shooting the last ball and oops connection issue or the game freezes and then when the game comes back I’ve lost my turn. Or after i win the game, it freezes and goes back to the last shot as if I didn’t win and then the time runs out causing me to lose. So frustrating!

However, I have hit shots that have been negated, with the turn being given over to the opponent, causing me to lose games. Also, while believing I am playing an opponent, I was really playing the computer, under a opponents name. With this, the opponent's shot time is always wound down to the last seconds. Moreover, time has run punt on an opponent's shot, but his late shot will still count. While, if I run the clock-shot down to the limit, my shot is forfeited. When I am winning a game, the app always unnecessarily delays my shots. With these defects, it makes this game very unpleasant & stressful. However, I've seen no other pool app as realistic as this one. It's a shame such a virtually dynamic champion of an app/game, is ruined by the obvious disadvantages set-forth by the producers.
    Cheats on shots. Places balls u pot, back on table, & when u pot 8-ball on breaks, places it back on table.

I have it both on my phone and my IPad. Sometimes it is frustrating but that's only when I shoot like crap but when I'm on it's great as with anything. When you play 1 on 1 it matches you with someone who is very close, if not the same level as yourself. In a tournament it pits you against people of all different levels which is fine. Overall I am addicted. I have been playing this game since it came out. Anyone who tries to compare this game to real life pool is out of their mind but for learning a few basics it’s fine. Playing with English on this game gives you a good indication of what it would do on a real table. I play this and real pool on leagues and tournaments.

So I think it would help if u put maybe about 4 buttons on your screen, the first button saying “easy” the second one saying “medium”the third one saying “hard” and the last one saying “INSANE” and all of the buttons appear on your screen right b4 (before) the round starts or something like that so ima rate this 4 stars!

There are a few things i hate about this game! if you are playing a million dollar table it does not have “call the pockets” so players just hit the cue ball where ever and it goes in the pocket that they weren’t even aiming for! I lost a lot of games that way and it should be fix! Second thing is they should have more tables to where your rank should be equally ranks with your opponent. I shouldn’t be playing a player that is a 100x better than me and I don’t even get a chance to shoot! Third is if its like pool make it like pool, if you break and the 8 ball gores in the pocket you should automatically win just like 9 ball! 

The tournament win streak game’s especially the ones when you have to win multiple games in a row to get your points up. I do not understand how players have hundred of thousand of points when the tournament just starts. That gives no average player a chance to win! You should have different ranks for that tournament just saying!

The last thing is the pool sticks. You should either be able to trade in your pool sticks for cash, more points to upgrade, or a gift box that is equal to your sticks grade. Any stick at “MAX LEVEL” should be trade able! 

I am giving it 3 stars for this reason. Fix the glitches thats the worst when you millions of coins on the line!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-02T13:43:25-07:00

Then the “glitch” happens. To explain it best, the glitch symptoms causes the game to act as if I never took the shot at all. I watch the 8 ball go into the pocket and wait from my congratulations and coins, only to find that it was as if the shot never happened and my opponent now has “ball-in-hand” and he wins the game. I can understand if these things happen once in awhile, but it was almost every game. I had plenty of time on my shot clock too, so don’t try to blame it on that.

The wheel spins and scratches never win anything significant. The boxes also rarely give you anything of value. I think some games may give you unfortunate rolls to cause you to lose more games. I say this because even the best players only have a little over a 50% win rate.  The game also constantly crashes... makes me wonder if is because I win a lot and they have to have a way to keep me from playing since I don’t buy anything.

If you have the coins it sometimes won’t let you play because it says you’re out of coins. Then sometimes it just forgets all your coins and gives you zero. This last one got me to quit because you can’t play any good tables without some coin.

It also has tons of random bugs. Often you can’t aim properly. It cue will move right then left all while trying to move the same way. The direction you need to shoot isn’t possible. Even when it’s an open table with nothing blocking. Other times it aims just fine. The shot power is totally random because it will release the shot while sliding down the power bar. Often just tapping the cue and losing your shot without shooting.  Sometimes it just shoots randomly while you are aiming.  If they fixed these things it would be a good game.

Now if you want to do anything you have to pay real money. Also I am quite sure that they use an algorithm that attempts to deplete the coin balances of players that have bought coins because as soon as you start getting a decent amount of coins, you all of a sudden can’t join a game unless it is against someone 100+ levels higher than you and with a 75% win percentage. Also thinks like breaking... I have used he same break in this game forever, but as soon as I paid, this break stopped potting balls. There have also been violations of the games physics, and bounces that just do not make sense and end up costing me a turn or even the game. Coincidentally, once this happens you start getting bombarded even more with the “Here’s a new deal! Buy more coins to level up!” 

So long story short, either don’t get the game or do not buy any coins. Because as soon as your name is in their system as someone who is willing to pay, your games will be rigged.

Secondly, the currency itself is an issue, the game is stingy, in order to make more chips you must play for higher stakes, sounds normal at first until you realize that people are practically unbeatable if you’re fairly new to the game. 
My third issue with the game is the fact that if you aren’t breaking the rack there’s a good chance you won’t get a turn during your game, you’ll just be sitting there watching while some bot or skillful player beats you without you even having a chance to do anything whatsoever.

Without her knight her life has no light. Yet, lonely in a sea of knights, a single James awaits his wife. He has searched every castle, every cave, every room, looking for thy bride to accompany thy groom. They search for each other, each and every day, to reunite their lives. Each day he prays that he will find thy wife. What is a maiden to do without her knight? Without her knight her life has no light. Yet, lonely in a sea of knights, a single James awaits his wife.”

Lost 1 Million in coins that I fortunately did not pay for, but had won in gameplay. To replace it would be one hundred US dollars. Pass. Tech support is involved and they are reviewing the issue.

It was fun because I always believed I had a chance to win. All of a sudden I started missing shots I could easily make before and my opponents were making shots that were almost impossible. It’s like I was playing a bot that was designed to be just good enough to almost always win. And the funny thing was it started happening once I made an in app purchase. To me the game is designed to go after people that it thinks will fork over money. And that’s when the game was absolutely ruined for me. Im a capitalist and I believe everybody needs to make money but when you get the feeling your being cheated that’s not good. Too bad because this could be such a fun game.

Often the opponents playing levels are set so high that you can never win for stretches.   Especially if you have been playing well or decide to bet a lot.    It’s nearly impossible to average over 65% wins overall also.

The match play is great as you can play w friends from Facebook or online against people from around the world. 

The developers have added lots of unlockable gear that keep the game interesting, like cues, chatpacks, and skins. These can be purchased with ingame currency or real money. 

The only real downside and area i would ask developers to improve on is to make more features available without having to use real money. I have been playing for several years now and my in-game coins/cash accumulation is slow because i refuse to spend real cash on the game.

Unfortunately this game has two serious problems which combine to make one fatal flaw. The first problem is that the player matching system acts way too quickly often providing literally zero opportunity to back out of a game and matching a player with someone of dramatically higher rank, sometimes multiple times higher. The second is that clicking away the pop ups often has you accidentally start a match which sets you up with the most expensive possible game. Combined with the first problem you will occasionally be forced to play someone for nearly all your in-game money who may be significantly more skilled and experienced than you. This has happened to me about 7 times in a couple months, and twice I effectively lost all my money.

I’ve played against almost 200 level players as a level 30! There are more than often games where you will only get one turn.

It seems they just don’t care about how bad the game has become because of these cheaters and hackers. there are apps and programs out there, that allow players to making possible shots, three bank shots with double kiss on the 8 ball, 2-3 bank shots on every single shot of a game, getting ball in hand after every single shot, turn all the balls into black squares, auto aiming to never miss a shot, etc. etc. Mini clip did add three dots on everybody’s profile pic so that you can report cheaters, but it seems every day there’s more and more out there. we noticed a club name that’s ranked number two, and their name contains the word hackers, and miniclip allows them to stay. And looking at the members of that club, at the beginning of the week they already had billions of coins won.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-09T06:53:07-07:00

However, the “slow connection” hoax has more effect on the game than a given players skill or that of their opponent; assuming you’re not playing some bot which is always possible too. 

It’s been my experience that somewhere between 8-13% of the games have the “slow connection” manufactured interruptions built in that causes, at a minimum, player to loose their turn or replay a shot you’ve already made; the latter usually occurs when you come back and have no time left. Same result, you loose your turn. I’ve actually tracked it and that’s the numbers… 8-13% depending on how close you may be to “leveling up”, extending winning streak or value of table stakes being played for. 

The end result is a bad experience, especially when one has purchased coins and gets cheated by the program. It must be made for idiots that would keep buying coins while getting blatantly robbed by built in “glitches”.  

Fortunately, I’ve not bought coins. Any reasonably good player can win more than they’re being robbed of;  but hey, the game is free so you’re getting what you pay for. I’d not bet a penny of real money on a program filled with built in ways to perpetuate fraud! 

Seems as if the poker games are similar, with respect to “slow connection” issues causing players to magically disconnect during critical hands, usually when you’ve got the nuts!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-25T11:44:32-07:00

Anyhow, overall this is a good pool game. No forced videos to watch which is a huge plus. There is an obvious push to buy coin but you do not have to. The mini games to earn coin are completely rigged, but I’m not playing for those anyhow. Been playing for a while, I have made some serious coin and lost it all and come back a bit all while not paying one cent of real money! No one likes to lose, but I don’t think the game is cheating as some suggest. Learn to accept a loss people even to those with incredibly dumb luck. Just keep spamming the “unlucky” option and not doing the rematch—you will be fine. 

I do recommend this game: only real change I think they should make is the need to recharge your cue...I can lose coin on my own thanks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-27T08:25:33-07:00
