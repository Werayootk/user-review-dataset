Which leads me into my second issue , there is absolutely no ranking in this game , you can be paired with literally any and every level , I played a tournament and I was the only low level there (I’ve never seen a person hit a 4 cusion pocket accurately until this tournament) . And I didn’t even make it past the quarterfinals due to playing with people wayyyyyyyy out of my skill level , I feel they need to implement some kind of ranking system so the matches are more fairly based and more entertaining",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=543186831&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-16T01:17:22-07:00
