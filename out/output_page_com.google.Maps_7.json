After the insurance company came and assessed the work they estimates just over $17,000 to complete the work. Because of Mark‚Äôs help we ended up paying only $2,500 out of pocket. I give Alta Builders 5 Stars and would recommend them to anyone! Thanks for your great and complete work Alta Builders!

Hahah ITS ACTUALLY WORSE Hahah this couldn't Plot the correct route 4mins, down the Road, Haha Yes Seriously. Deleted it went with WAZE. \n\nGoogle is Officially done, on Apple Devices. \n\nAbout a year later, the bugs and glitches; what Google calls features, are fixed, I still don't use the bugs and glitches. I only need a map app that works. This one doesn't. Not anymore. Goggle maps is now worse than Apple maps. I never thought that possible, until today, when Google maps, tried send me through Boston to get to Shirley from Milford. Kept directing me further and further from where I wanted to go. I pulled over downloaded Apple Maps and my trip time dropped from well over and Hour to 26 mins. Never thought I'd see the day Apple maps Destroyed Google Maps. Never thought Apple could be that good and Google that bad, at the same time.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-13T13:37:32-07:00"},{"id":"8729757653","userName":"Michael-Forrest Mohler-C","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id542728212","version":"6.20","score":5,"title":"Great Legal Representation.","text":"It is my privilege to recommend Bryan Rayburn,\nESQ., an excellent lawyer who will without a doubt\nmeet your expectations. I know his skill set serves\nall areas of his practice well and in a stellar\nmanner. Bryan has excellent analytical skills, which\nresulted in a very effective strategy for my case.\nBryan is very personable and easily, as with me, he\ngained my trust and I'm certain this has been the\ncase with the clients with whom he works with. I\nwould exclusively hire Bryan again for any future\nneeds. Bryan's exceptional verbal and writing skills\nhave served him well with my case. He researched\nall facets of my case thoroughly and furnished me\nwith an excellent logical strategy. Additionally,\nBryan is a gifted public speaker. He has not only\nrepresented me in court with skill and\nprofessionalism, and has represented his firm like an\nambassador. Bryan Rayburn constantly strives to\nfurther educate himself and improve his research,\npreparation and court room techniques. My case\nwas expeditiously managed with a positive\noutcome.\nAgain, allow me to reiterate and aver that I\nrecommend Bryan as lawyer. I believe his work\nwould, not only meet, but exceed your\nexpectations should you choose to hire him.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-06-01T05:04:40-07:00"},{"id":"8409372080","userName":"Auge47","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1304007260","version":"6.7","score":4,"title":"Decent Navigation","text":"I don‚Äòt typically write reviews. Especially not for a monopoly corporation such as Google. However, I was genuinely impressed with this app.\n9/10 it always points me in the right direction and is the only application I know of that allows you to navigate your way through military bases, which was very helpful when I first arrived at Fort Riley.\nIt does have occasional hiccups. Sometimes it would direct me to an old or disused road instead of a main route. While I understand the initial reasoning is for shorter travel time, this can be very disorienting - especially with someone that may already have anxiety behind the wheel.\nOverall I would recommend this app to anyone that needs swift and accurate navigational assistance. It is definitely worth having it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-01T07:43:45-07:00"},{"id":"8226389738","userName":"blaqmare","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id32492842","version":"5.88","score":1,"title":"Arrogant. Ignores the little guy.","text":"Google maps has achieved great levels of acceptance and success and they are letting it go to their head. Here is my problem with the Google maps app and why I have given it a 1 star.  I have submitted 5-6 times over the course of several months through the app for a correction of our street name. The issue is the Google maps voice on the app saying the last part of the street name ONLY.\n\nDue to this issue, delivery drivers and visitors have gotten lost and driven on to the other side of town, wasting gas and minutes (up to an hour at times) on the road due to this mishandling. \n\nI am sure I am not the only one who has submitted this error but still Google maps continues to ignore / dismiss the request possibly deeming it unimportant or irrelevant since no one famous or high profile lives here.  There are decent respectable people who live here and this is not an issue about being nit-picky but about being treated correctly.\n\nI leave reviews and am a ‚Äúlocal scout‚Äù or whatever  and still use the app due to the fact that Google maps does a few things better than other map apps I have used but I am starting to think about shutting down my Google reviews profile and email account and getting into another emailing, ID, maps system since I and my street name are deemed irrelevant by Google maps.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-10T12:49:36-07:00"}]
