OneNote and Teams on Mac are both pretty miserable for example. But this Outlook app is among the best apps on my phone. Fast, intuitive, super reliable. Seems to use standard iOS conventions where possible, but also has creative (and again, intuitive) solutions to accomplishing feature-parity with the desktop app. One specific example is the calendar invite / scheduling functionality. It's brilliant. 

I wish more Microsoft apps on Apple platforms were done by the team responsible for this one. And no, I'm not a part of that team or know anything about it. I'm saying this genuinely.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-20T00:29:51-07:00
