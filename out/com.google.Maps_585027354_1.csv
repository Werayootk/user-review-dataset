I can’t even think about getting directions without complete loss of control of my phone which leads me to my next point. Almost EVERY single time I need the directions and am forced into Google Maps the application needs an update. When I need directions, I need directions because I have somewhere I need to be. For instance, today my job was to pick someone up from a location.

I’m not. 

Previous review:
Why can’t I simply copy an address? I get the special coordinates, or if it’s a location I get the location name. Furthermore, what’s the point of multiple stops on my journey, if after the first stop I lose the route because my closed for 5min?

11059230246,HDR3356742,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id417182821,6.107.3,3,Not Reliable,I think it is mind boggling as much as Google invests in AI and how long Google maps have existed that Google maps cannot do a simple reroute without bringing me through a one street school zone with one lane for a red light. It turned my route into an extra 30 minutes for no reason. Sometimes I think this company just gets money from oil execs because it wants to waste your gas. Good lord get it together,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T12:22:26-07:00

When forced to give the quickest route by adding stops Google Maps confirms there are much quicker ways. Quickly becoming  useless app.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T12:00:01-07:00
