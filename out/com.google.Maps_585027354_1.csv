Whenever I need to find information about a business or restaurant, all I need to do is enter the name or approximation into the search bar and G Maps provides me with all the details I need. The best feature I think is that it syncs my searches across devices so I can locate a place using G Maps on my iPad and then find it again quickly on my Android phone when I need to start navigating there. I also love the pinpoint precision and accuracy of Google Maps navigation. It’s like the perfect app to navigate the way to where you want to go and play around with it when you’re bored.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-30T18:43:50-07:00
