I just want to clarify that but several other things have bothered me for years and need to be addressed. For one, the application is very controlling when you try to search an address without the app open. If I even start to Google an address it will take over my phone and force me into the application or the application store to update for use. I can’t even think about getting directions without complete loss of control of my phone which leads me to my next point. Almost EVERY single time I need the directions and am forced into Google Maps the application needs an update. When I need directions, I need directions because I have somewhere I need to be. For instance, today my job was to pick someone up from a location. I got lost and when I googled the directions it immediately took me to google maps without a choice and I had a FIFTEEN MINUTE update (only option) I would have never made it to the customer if it wasn’t for a third party application.

I’m not. 

Previous review:
Why can’t I simply copy an address? I get the special coordinates, or if it’s a location I get the location name. Furthermore, what’s the point of multiple stops on my journey, if after the first stop I lose the route because my closed for 5min? This is after stepping out on my first stop for gas, rest station, or store. That defeats the whole purpose of this feature.

It is quite annoying to have (as the person from TorontoOH coined it) “Miss Yip-Yap” in the middle of emptying the bladder shout out where you should be going and multiple times, is enough to switch to a different app. 
   The second button that needs to be placed on this app is a “REROUTE” button or a “take me a different way” option.  Too many people willing to cause too many crashes added to the ever increasing traffic jams mix in some construction and you’ve got a severe need to find a different path.  Right now if I take that open lane to the off ramp Miss Yip-Yap is more than happy to guide me right back into the thick of the traffic jam.
