When, like most Americans, I'm striving to be both local & environmentally conscientious & have to zoom in excessively, visit other sites online, download yet another app, or research to see what's actually there, it's an extremely time consuming process. I'm supporting local & legitimate business owners that live here. Example: When I need to find someone to mow a lawn, install a security system, etc., I don't want want to speak to someone that lives 800 plus miles away. How can Americans help small local business entrepreneurs grow and be successful, when to do so, it's next to impossible to even obtain a valid phone number ?
