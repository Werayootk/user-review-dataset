11055714185,Bellasings,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id152363674,2024.11.1,5,Kate,"I think that Kate had several children quickly and maintained a very active life as a princess and now has to have female surgery to rectify things that she’s been through in childbirth.   I don’t know why people have to make such a big deal out of it and exaggerate and why can’t they leave her alone and let her be a princess needing privacy. I think Kate & William are sick of being seen through a microscope and after all that was done to Lady Di, I think they’re trying to prevent any of that chaos for their own personal future’s. 
This is a highly dignified and educated family and couple with lives to run and jobs to do and the people of the world need to understand that they would like some privacy to do it. Put yourselves into their shoes and see if you would like to be living in a glass palace!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T12:13:12-07:00
