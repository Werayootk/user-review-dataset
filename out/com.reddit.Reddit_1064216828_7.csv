I mean licks the bowl clean. The food is high quality and has been a total solution for his sensitive stomach. The issue I have with The Farmers Dog centers around their delivery service. When I started I was on a subscription plan with automatic deliveries. That didn‚Äôt work well as the company seemed to ship every 5 days overwhelming my freezer capacity and charging my credit card repeatedly. I asked to be placed on a call in basis and that has become exasperating. Some times you get the food 3 or 4  days after placing the order. Other times it has taken as long as 7 days. Because of these inconsistencies I have run out of food on numerous occasions . That is my only complaint and the reason they only get 3 stars. This company has a quality product but they really need to get their act together on service",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1064216828&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T11:53:39-07:00

This is a highly dignified and educated family and couple with lives to run and jobs to do and the people of the world need to understand that they would like some privacy to do it.
