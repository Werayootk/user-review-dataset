It’s annoying to sit there in my car or wherever I am and scroll over and over to get to the bottom. If you just put a scroll feature on the side, it would make things so much easier. Also, it’s weird how when you search an artist, you can really only go to for that artist or click on all of their discography but there isn’t a way to pull up every single song they’ve made.

My biggest complaint, however, is even when I’m in great Wi-Fi with all of my bars and 5G activated it takes sometimes minutes, or multiple tries of closing the app and restarting it. One of my playlists has a around 5000 songs. But if the playlists aren’t able to handle that much, they shouldn’t allow you to create such big playlists.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T22:35:00-07:00

It has so many good qualities like AMAZING sound quality, ALL of the songs I could even hope for, it even tells you if the artist you follow has any events near you or coming soon!!! 
And there is SO many more things to Spotify that me and my family loves that I can’t think of at this moment…. Buuuuuut there is one itty bitty thing I don’t really like about it.. you can’t play the song you want without it shuffling multiple songs and not the one you want. Which is very annoying sometimes when your trying to show someone a song you like or something like that…… But other than that little inconvenience it really really TRULY an AMAZING app. Also, the premium is a good option too they have many options and plans to fit you or your family’s needs ( I can’t really say that much about it tho because I don’t have premium because I am poor, but from what I’ve heard it’s grater than the free version) Anyway I 100% recommend getting Spotify!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-19T20:18:31-07:00
