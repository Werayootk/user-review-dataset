When I try to set up my account, it asks for me to verify my account on the authenticator app. THIS *IS* THE AUTHENTICATOR APP. Absolutely frustrating. I resent my infrastructure that forces us to have Outlook accounts. All IT people hate it for a reason. So far removed from being user-friendly.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-05T14:25:20-07:00"},{"id":"8319051657","userName":"Brentstr2001","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id112358736","version":"6.5.87","score":5,"title":"Easy","text":"Works great when you have several accounts that require authentication.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-02-04T12:20:59-07:00"},{"id":"10125513522","userName":"bennygato","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id172612402","version":"6.7.12","score":2,"title":"Need to unlock 3 times to make it work?!","text":"Need to unlock 3 times before I can authenticate.
