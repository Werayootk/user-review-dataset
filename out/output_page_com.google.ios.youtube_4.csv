However, many videos I try to watch will be restricted, I‚Äôll then go to watch it on the tv or my brother‚Äôs computer and I‚Äôll find that the videos aren‚Äôt really that inappropriate.

I would like to watch French videos for my class without the ‚Äúthis video is restricted‚Äù showing up to block my view. 

I also can‚Äôt turn off restricted mode even when my network admin does, it‚Äôs annoying.

As for the comments, children learn inappropriate things from both the internet and real life. Removing the comments for child content is ridiculous and absurd; remove the harmful comments, not the entirety.
A child-friendly content maker I know lost the ability to receive comments simply because she put her videos as kid-friendly. She loved viewing those comments.

-Commenting has issues. Sometimes a comment infinitely processes with the ‚Äúloading‚Äù symbol. Other times, it‚Äôs an issue to click out of writing a comment. You usually are able to tap on the screen away from the comment typing box at any time to close it and return to the main interface, but sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work and you must close the app in itself.

-Every video has a ‚ÄúNot interested‚Äù you can select. While watching a video, there is a recommendations bar at the right of the screen. The video at the very top of this bar does not have a Not interested selection, so if you do not like the video at all you will still get it recommended to you.
-The app randomly crashes often
-When scrolling through the play bar, most videos show you a small screenshot of what displays at that point in time of the video. Other videos do not have this.

I absolutely love that change and it would be super amazing if you could implement the old pull-down card version with that addition.

I really prefer swiping to the left to dismiss those video cards instead of down with the new style as well.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2018-01-03T07:06:23-07:00
2020899423,Avi Avalos,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id559106009,12.47.16,3,Needs a little improvement,I like the app it just has a few glitches that need to be fixed. When I start watching a video it takes forever to load than when it starts playing it stops about 10 seconds into the video and it says it‚Äôs loading when it‚Äôs not. I restart the video a few times and it stops at the same place so I close out of the video and try again. Sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn‚Äôt so I have to repeat the process multiple times. Another thing is that when there is an add it takes a really long time to load or it doesn‚Äôt load. I‚Äôm the middle of a video I close out then I have to repeat the process I do at the beginning. Than when it finally starts working correctly I have to find my place and that takes even longer to load. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling but that doesn‚Äôt fix the problem.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-23T08:31:43-07:00
