My husband, daughter and son-in-law, have all tried (all very technical) and can't delete it!!  I've tried to get in touch with Microsoft and, you can only chat online!  But, only thing is, they say someone will help you soon...but no one ever comes online to help me!!  And I've tried several times!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-27T14:00:40-07:00"},{"id":"3328795115","userName":"Mikeradu","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id172272875","version":"6.0.5","score":2,"title":"Solid.

My company makes me use it in combination with office 365, otherwise I don’t think I’d voluntarily use it. \n\nHowever, I would be significantly happier with this product if it allowed iOS12 to pass through the OTP and automatically paste it into the app without me having to type it up. Most other apps can do that - surely it’s not that hard to implement. \n\nThank you","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-10-21T16:51:48-07:00"},{"id":"7076042074","userName":"beanie144","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id220498993","version":"6.5.38","score":5,"title":"Version history not helpful","text":"The version history info doesn’t provide anything about the actual bug fixes.
