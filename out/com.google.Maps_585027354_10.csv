Google maps is one of those. 2 things maps got rid of recently that were nice features or worked better. 1. 3D buildings in navigation mode. When in nav mode on my phone I used to see the 3D buildings and now they are gone no matter which map filters I apply. And 2. The new routes is clunky and buggy and doesn‚Äôt work. I liked just seeing the routes available on the map and tapping the one I want to take.

Their whole team was very friendly, very polite, very prompt, and very helpful.
They did exactly what they said they were going to do and promised to help me, which they did.
I received the parts I needed in a timely fashion, but more important I feel I received good old fashioned customer service.
