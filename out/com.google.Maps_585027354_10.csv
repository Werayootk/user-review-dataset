If you wish to keep your chosen route, you have to take your eyes off the road, hands off the wheel, open the phone, navigate to the app, then press the Dismiss button. Dangerous. If you’re on a motorcycle, impossible. Searching online, I see that this is an EXTREMELY common complaint.

My big suggestion to make this widget even better would be to have the ability 'pin' your most used transit options so it's not necessarily location based. For example, my closest subway station is 3 blocks away, so my phone doesn't list it as an option for me.

Typically, when someone writes a one star review, they tend to exaggerate problematic aspects of the app to suit a narrative. However, here, no exaggeration is needed.

When driving in New York, google maps is unable to distinguish between driving on overpasses vs the streets underneath. If I’m going 40+mph, would I be going in the local streets with stop signs? 

What happened to all the machine learning? Wouldn’t you be able to distinguish, with the vast amount of data that you have collected, the difference between someone driving in a local vs high speed overpass?

In Berlin, the app has consistently failed to map out correctly where to take public transportation. It creates fantasy routes, going through buildings and towers, impossible to follow and to use.

So, this brings me to the question: who is working on this? What are these “engineers” doing? Engineers: if your natural inclination is to “solve problems”, know that you have solved few and created many. Congratulations on being able to do minimal spanning trees or topological sorts, but know that in reality this is utterly useless.

The loading speed of this app while connected to Apple CarPlay is unbelievable. It takes 30+ seconds to switch between apps because of this app (it wasn’t a problem before when I was using Apple maps). It slows down all of the other apps in the background and caused some of them to shut down. 

2. The map navigation kept talking while I was using the phone app to make a call through the car. The other person kept hearing my directions in their ear. 

3. I was driving on the freeway through downtown LA when the app shut down on me. I was on a junction between three freeways when it suddenly closed itself and I had to guess which freeway to take. I’m lucky that I know the area, but if a tourist was using this app, they’d be lost and late. A detour in downtown can result in 20+ minutes of lost time. Also, the app kept trying to navigate me to a new location every time it shut it self down. When I reopen the app, it would take me to a different place than the most recent location. 

I love google maps for traveling on vacation or just whenever it’s not plugged into my car, but it’s just unusable for me when I drive, which is 95% of the time when I use the app. I really hope fixes are made because it’s a good app and I’d like to move back from Apple maps.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-16T16:21:23-07:00

4. Walking in public transit. I’m not sure why but I can’t figure out how it wants me to figure out how to walk to stations. I always have to do live view, then cancel that, to get walking instructions for a leg of the trip.
