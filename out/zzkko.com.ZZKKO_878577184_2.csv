I wish I had been ordering my clothes and stuff from Shein a long time ago. The order came much faster than expected which was great because I‚Äôm in Florida . Then I opened the package and everything I ordered was beautiful and was very true to size and surprisingly good quality especially for the price and it looked just liked the picture. I had even bought a lace open back shirt that looked like you could buy it in a department store store for easily 4 times what I paid at Shein and the quality is just great . The App is very user friendly I had to make a return of one of the items because I ordered one size to small and the return process was very very easy and you can track it the whole time and then have the option to put it to a credit or your Shein Account. And Shein gives you points to buy stuff with as well . I would say as some advice read reviews first as some stuff runs  a little smaller that others . But definitely don‚Äôt hesitate ordering from Shein. It‚Äôs great !!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-02-06T07:28:33-07:00

I love the concept of cheaper things and who doesn't, we live in a society of money. i do have many concerns for this app, one of them being the packaging that they use. they use horrible non eco friendly packaging, and a ridiculous amount of plastic that it is honestly shocking, plus the audacity to make a #shiencares trend protecting wildlife animals, when their packaging is not, is ridiculous. yes its cheap, but at the success this app has im pretty sure they could spend some money making their packaging more eco friendly, therefore bringing in more costumers to buy on their site. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fast fashion and non sustainable packaging, everyone would shop here, they definitely could be making more. another concern i have is the fast fashion problem. Shien isnt ethical. they continue to steal designs from small brands, and we dont know how much money their workers are paid, but im not confident it‚Äôs enough. this company wont probably see this but make a change. for the good of the world and your workers.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-16T17:20:03-07:00

However, sometimes when I order a package it doesn‚Äôt give me my updates. I usually copy the tracking number and put it into Safari and go onto US PS so that I can get updates on where my packages. So it will text me when there‚Äôs new updates. And I get way more texts about where my packages and What‚Äôs the next steps are for my package but I‚Äôm Shein all it says is that it‚Äôs shipped.

For instants I bought a little bear decorative item but I thought it would be a stuffed animal but turned out to be very very small and was hard and not like the material I thought it would be. Also ordered a little bear keychain and I had ordered one for my friend but it came with a book bag and it was a bear stuff animal but mine was so so so tiny and it was for a keys chain not a keychain . I also ordered clothes off of SHEIN and it said true to size but when I put my size in and ordered them they were too small so I had to order two sizes over my original size. SHIEN is a really good app but maybe change the pictures of what I‚Äôm going to order more realistic. One more thing when I ordered over 20 items off of Shein I expected to be more boxes or bags but they were all stuffed in one bag and most of the things I got that were soft were flattened.

Look at the description for the materials, it will help you decide the quality and how the clothing will hold up. Read the reviews, look at the pics!

Their products are of OK quality depending on what you get. Clothing wise they have been great. Their sizes vary and it‚Äôs hit and miss.

Also make sure you can return what you purchase. I just found out they have some things that are not returnable. My issue is I bought hats that were totally smashed upon packaging or whatever so they don‚Äôt look like expected And they say you cannot return hats.

But my Internet has been acting weird & slow and seemed somebody put a virus on my system. I click on websites and keep getting warning from Hackers. But those are the Hackers.
Never trust Popup errors and call the number on your phone or email that‚Äôs sent to you.
Just recently Norton sent me an email that Shein was tracked for a security breach. Also Spectrum my Internet company keeps alerting me that Shein is a Secutity Threat or breaching my Internet. Someone in Shein is hacking or someone who works for the company itself is trying to get into our IP Address or Hack something from our systems. 
I‚Äôm at a loss because I love Shein and can‚Äôt believe they are not protecting their company. Please Shein have a better security system to protect your faithful customers. I probably won‚Äôt use them again. It shows at several times or three different times Shein was attempting to Hack or threat our personal internet or phone security.
The same thing happened with Haute Look website. A year later I got Norton saying Securiy was breached there. And they never contacted me or customers stating their was hacking in their system, please be careful with any internet company, App, or Out of Country Business since they don‚Äôt have same security measures!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-22T13:57:51-07:00

First let me begin by saying the measurements for the clothes are completely wrong, when you order something that should fit you it won‚Äôt. They will have you ship it back for free, but you won‚Äôt get your original shipping back in the refund. Secondly, the customer service is AWFUL. They do not give a crap about any inconveniences you experience due to their many screw ups. I ordered a robe and chemise set for my birthday, a 1X should have fit by the measurements. It didn‚Äôt. I sent it back and told them I wanted a refund. I ordered a size up because it was a just a tiny bit too small and the measurements said the 2XL was 2 inches bigger so the 2X should have fit perfect. Iwas wrong it was about .5 inches bigger. Measurements were definitely wrong. Barely a difference. They don‚Äôt care. Finally they receive my first return and instead of refunding my money they ship me a replacement? I chatted them and told them I requested a refund not a replacement and they said it was too late it had already been shipped I have to ship it back. So now I have to wait ANOTHER 2-3 weeks for my money because of their screw up. This website is a literal joke. Also, I left a honest review about the measurements of the robe and they hid it from the item. They only post reviews that benefit them. Total trash.

I didn‚Äôt believe her at first, but I decided to give it a try anyway as soon as I got the app, I begin to search up things that I like. A bunch of things all in the style. I liked popped up after I searched a few words. I think the only downfall to the variety is that there aren‚Äôt very many movie/TV shows/anime clothes and  costumes, (you can always buy those on Amazon.)One of the things I was disappointed about was that the prices were more expensive then I had previously thought on clothes, (shortly after I realized you get a bunch of coupons) but then I thought, ‚Äúwhy not look at jewelry considering I don‚Äôt have a lot of it‚Äù I was SHOCKED at the prices of the jewelry items and accessories.

They have a broad variety of clothing, shoes, jewelry, accessories, etc. The items that are sold on SHEIN are in excellent condition. The quality is fabulous. The prices are unbelievable. They are always running sales, and you can snag amazing outfits and accessories at an absolute STEAL! 

There are many ways to save on SHEIN. You can accumulate points by participating in outfit contests, joining in on their live-streams, participating in mini games, and creating your own ‚Äúfashion show‚Äù. There is also a Free Trial Center where you are able to submit applications for specific products for a chance to be selected to try out those products FOR FREE and leave reviews for them, and as you leave reviews for products, you rack up points. 

I highly recommend this app. If you are a bargain shopper, like I am, and you like to find amazing, high-quality products at a reasonable price, then SHEIN is for you!

So I placed a order of several hundred dollars not knowing what I was going to receive. It took several weeks for my order to arrive. It was coming from overseas so I expected it to take some time. Each item came individually package in a Shein plastic bag. The material was good quality and some were soft to the touch. All my items were true to size so I didn't have to size up or down. I liked most of the items I purchased and others were a bit too much for me so I gave away to my younger nieces. They seemed to suit her age bracket. All in all I was satisfied with my order.

My advice is the make sure you look at the reviews and any added pictures before you buy a product, since some things run small and large. The reason for the 3 stars and not 5 is because of their customer service. They got rid of their custom service chat with an actual person on their app and now it is just an automated chat which has been proven to be very unhelpful. I have had to Facebook message them to get ahold of someone and even then, it takes over a day just to get a response. I also advise y‚Äôall to pay for the expedited shipping because your package will take multiple weeks and the shipping information will not be updated as fast if you use their free shipping method. I placed an order on April 3, 2020 and I placed another one a few weeks later and paid for expedited shipping. I received the expedited shipping order within a week and a half, but I have yet to receive my original order that was placed on April 30. Just pay for expedited shipping and look at the clothing reviews and y‚Äôall will receive some awesome clothes for really cheap!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2020-06-04T09:55:42-07:00
10450862998,Lemm.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1386172361,9.7.9,3,Age restriction,"SHEIN has been amazing to me and my family for the past few months. It has very good products and clothes, and they have been very affordable. There‚Äôs just one thing that bothers me. SHEIN has added ‚ÄúSexual Wellness‚Äù products and there is no age restriction for it. I really think that none of that should show up if you don‚Äôt have an account registered. There are many kids that go to SHEIN to look for clothes, and I‚Äôm afraid that they might come across the products on accident. It can be very tempting to not want to know what that is about, kids can be very curious. I have a sister who uses SHEIN every day to look for clothes. I wouldn‚Äôt want for her to look at any of those products. The only thing that it asks you when click on that category is if your over the age of 18 and that‚Äôs it. It doesn‚Äôt make you confirm/ prove your real age. The worst part is that the category shows in the ‚ÄúBeauty‚Äù area. Please change it so that adults can only see it. That can either be by signing in with SHEIN or making it confirm your age, or just taking off those products from the app, which I doubt SHEIN will do. Please fix this problem.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-07T20:52:29-07:00

Though it can be a little complicated finding just what you want, and the right sizes, I think it‚Äôs so reasonable! The prices are amazing, and not to mention the coupons!!! Also, there‚Äôs flash sales a lot of the time which is so nice. I got a sweater in a flash sale and it was over 50% off!! The clothes are good quality for the prices, and the experience on the app is amazing! I love getting such variation of things to choose from at the touch of a button. Shein really has helped me find some clothes I never would have found or tried in an actual store. I love how you can customize your information so it can automatically give you a size range to choose from. I love how easy it is to check out, and add things to your cart. I also really appreciate how you can see how much everything adds up to be in your cart, and that you can select and deselect to see that too. Overall, I definitely recommend this app. It‚Äôs just an amazing decision.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-10T19:35:59-07:00

9760951849,Vulpecula9,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1486234907,9.0.6,1,Long-time customer finally driven away for good,"Shein‚Äôs product quality, shipping times, and value vs. cost have steadily been getting worse and worse over the years.  Their customer service is absolutely terrible, and will ask your preference for things then intentionally do the exact opposite.  They have several items listed for sale that aren‚Äôt in stock (with no plans to restock) so they can force you to accept store credit instead of getting the items you actually purchased.  It‚Äôs also nearly impossible for me to find anything that fits my measurements.  I‚Äôm naturally long and lean, and Shein doesn‚Äôt carry my size at all - the smallest they carry is 2 sizes above in petites (which isn‚Äôt anywhere near long enough for my legs) or 3 sizes above in regular - and their clothing is already cut very large.  It‚Äôs especially frustrating with all the ‚ÄúShein for all‚Äù advertising making false claims about inclusivity.  Clearly, Shein is NOT for all, and doesn‚Äôt even TRY to be.  After dealing with their drastically declining quality, horrible customer service, and complete and utter lack of sizing options to fit me, Shein has finally driven me away for good, losing a long-time customer in the process.  I used to love Shein, but now it just disgusts me.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-28T06:23:57-07:00

This was not a surprise as it is made in China and when I was a kid I had a teacher tell us that China was using chemical warfare such as lead to poison our products to slowly kill people. That made complete sense to me as everything is mostly made in China. So please handle your Shein items with gloves or plastic bags wrapped around your hands and throw in the washer immediately without other clothing, wash them with a second rinse cycle and then do a rinse cycle in the machine after removing the clothing to remove residual lead. Lead is highly toxic and causes many diseases such as cancer and others. Buyers be careful! I still shop at Shein because they have the best outfits for the best prices. But that is the process I use to rid them of lead! Hope this helps all who shop at Shein.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-21T05:21:24-07:00

Also I had no problem getting a shipping label for my return. I know you‚Äôre suppose to size up a little but I sized up 2 sizes from my US size 4, and I was still way off on the size. 
I‚Äôve bought other things from the app and I really like their lashes and makeup. They have really cute indoor and outdoor decor.
My Daughter absolutely loves Shein and the clothes as well as the accessories she‚Äôs purchased were all things she could use. 
I gave them a 5 star review because they have a huge variety of items for a very affordable price, it may not always be exactly what you think it should be, but for the price it‚Äôs definitely worth a try‚Ä¶ and if it‚Äôs not what you thought it would be, you can ship it back to them for an exchange or a refund.

I placed an order weeks ago .. Im a plus size woman so this sites usually don‚Äôt have items that fit or favor plus size body types so I purchased some things I felt like would fit. 2 dresses, a two piece short set and another item that slipped my mind. One of the dresses was too small and the top to the short set didn‚Äôt fit but overall, I was still pleased because you get what you pay for and because I lived the other items so much that I didn‚Äôt care about the couple of bucks I spent on the items that can‚Äôt fit.. the shorts on the short set fit so I decided to use it as my running errand outfit and pair it with a T-shirt lol. The other dress that couldn‚Äôt fit is still in my closet. I love it still and I‚Äôm losing weight so I‚Äôm keeping it. I plan to order again and this time I‚Äôm going to buy a few shirts for work and some kind pants. This way I can give a compete rating on how everything fits from them. Until then, they‚Äôre are exceeding expectations already.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2018-07-12T06:24:41-07:00

I‚Äôve also ordered many things off of this app and everything has been fairly good quality and overall I‚Äôve been very happy about the clothes, accessories, etc. Then I saw a video on social media where this girl was talking about how someone had logged into her email, instagram, etc. she checked her email and the login had come from Shein. I checked the comments of this video and many people said they were experiencing the same thing. I was very surprised so I went to go check my email and saw that someone had tried to login to my email/other socials so I deleted this app. If you look up Shein you will see multiple articles on this subject. If you have Shein, Romwe, or Zaful, delete them!! They are all run under the same company. I deleted all 3 apps and I haven‚Äôt gotten a single hack alert in weeks. My sister also got an alert about these clothing apps then deleted them after and she also hasn‚Äôt gotten the alerts sent to her account. If you need fairly cheap stuff look on apps like Depop and AliExpress, they have cute cheap stuff that doesn‚Äôt try to scam you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-21T00:15:23-07:00

When I like an item but not enough to purchase it, Shein shows an outstanding ‚Äúitems like this‚Äù list underneath the original listing. This feature provides variety for a picky person like me. I especially appreciate the reviews section. Each item is modeled on a wide variety of body styles of women, with body measurements shown. I‚Äôm able to easily tell what size would fit on me best which is crucial in online shopping. This is my first attempt at not shopping in person, as the drastically proportioned person I am, and I am dumbfounded. The consistent updates on the package arrival through the app is wonderful too. It tweaks delivery time all the way up until the package shows up, so I know when to take it inside to avoid getting stolen, or so that I can schedule being home when it arrives.
