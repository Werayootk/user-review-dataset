I haven't used many of the free AI tools they now have or played much with all the other free accessible photo editing, AI text-to-video, or all the template features yet. Overall, Capcut most definitely has way more editing tools with many more various features available (with the majority of them accessible with the free versions) and with their newer platform, they also have cloud storage (which 5GB are available free but you can purchase how many you may need for your projects or business).  The downset, with most apps and platforms, are the download speed of some of the tools but that may just be my experiences on my devices being remotely controlled or malware hacking clogging up my device or connection speed (like local law enforcements and unentitled 'slackers' are notorious for, right!?!
