The new update came around and they made things cost money and took out a bunch of things. Let‚Äôs take effect for example. Last update you didn‚Äôt have to search for 30 minutes to find one effect because of the new update. They also took out the best effects making it so much worse to people. They also made ‚Äúpro‚Äù effects which are not very useful. The ‚Äúpro‚Äù effects, transitions and animations literally are such a rip off to buy. Capcut only had a fan base or people using it because it was FULLY FREE but because they took things out and made it money they are going to lose most of their user base.

Im Dan, I‚Äôve been using CapCut as my editing software for a couple months and I‚Äôve even=n used it for some school projects! I love your app, I love the fact that you can edit sounds, add text, do voiceovers, and the fact that it is free and easy to use! However, I do have some simple suggestions. 

1. The spaces when you put apostrophes are to long, it looks as if there are a couple spaces between the characters whenever an apostrophe is added.
2. Sometimes, the background of a photo isn‚Äôt a png whenever you try to make it a png, and blends in with the object you‚Äôre trying to keep (EX: Like an emoji blending in with the background and some of the emoji falling out or some of the background blending in with the emoji and not getting removed.)
3. Sometimes, the voiceovers aren‚Äôt able to be slowed down and sometimes you can‚Äôt hear them. This is really rare though and has only happened one time.

I love your app and I love almost everything in it. However, i think these suggestions need to be added in game. Thanks!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-11T22:53:13-07:00

Until an update came and screwed up the centering and sizing thing. If I try to move it after the overlay was added, the thing on the main track moves out of the centering and I have to do the centering all over again. Not to mention the sizing messed up as well, when the blue bar on the side of the image is supposed to turn white and snap to the edge, it doesn‚Äôt do that. Instead, what it does is snap to random parts without the edge of the image on the edge of the format. I hope you fix this soon, cause I have a video I‚Äôd like to finish without any of these issues.

I aslo recommend more 'Party' effects. And more opitions for 'Mask'. For example, you can have a 'Mask the person' button which cuts the main thing in the video or picture all by itself. I know theres a low possibility of you seeing this, but if you do I would definitely use the app even more than I do. I also recommend getting more 'Basic' effects and 'Animations' for transitions.

I‚Äôve been using capcut for almost a year now and I definitely would recommend it to someone that are novice to editing. I know that u creators are working really hard on capcut to give us the best and let us experience a great time with capcut. The reason why I‚Äôm giving this a 1 star is because of a glitch or bug when changing the speed ‚Äúnormal section‚Äù. Whenever I try to change the speed using the ‚Äúcircle‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt let me. Whenever I drag the circle to a certain speed, it just gives me a different and totally random speed. This is really really annoying, at first I thought maybe I should delete the app and reinstall but I did multiple times and it‚Äôs still the same. Please, fix this bug. I use an IPad 8th generation. 
I would give this a 5 star as soon as it‚Äôs fixed. Otherwise, I‚Äôm moving to another editing app.
Thank, 
Ryan.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software,2021-12-03T15:40:10-07:00

Honestly the key frames are pretty annoying but they work. The motion blur is more of a direction blurry but they do have a transition called then and now which is sort of motion blur. The slomo is awful and there is no good shake‚Ä¶ the text is fine, but I wish you could use a loop animation and a in and out one at the same time. A lot of the issues would be small fixes/changes to the app but would make a HUGE difference. Over all the app is very good for a free app with NO watermark.

Why is this? I tried editing my video, making it shorter and then longer, deleting my other projects, etc but nothing seemed to fix the problem that when exported into my camera roll it slowed my video down by one second, therefore the transitions were slowed.
