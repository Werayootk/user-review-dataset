Ive been using it since 2018-2019 and still use it Filters are great and I like it because on Imessage you can text whoever and get the message and sometimes that’s not always good but on snap you have to add the person which I personally like because you can choose who you have and ik you can too on iMessage but at least you can add them and half swipe to see what it is instead of having to actually o-en the message. Not sure if what I said makes sense but whatever. Great app, don’t regret using like ever",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-15T16:37:59-07:00
