The app used to be a fun way to keep up with friends and share your day. Recently they rolled out a My AI chatbot feature that has undisclosed access to your snaps (photos you send on the app) and chats (private and group messaging). I took a photo of my face and sent to a friend and the same instant I did that the AI chat bot sent me a message about ""having a nice hair day"" even though I never sent the AI bot a photo neither did I post a photo to a public or private story. The app just reeks blatant creepy and makes no effort to hide the fact they are tracking and analyzing you. At least other platforms try to act like they care about privacy. Snap does not.

There is also no way to not share your location with the AI. The company claims the bot does not have access to geolocation services but a simple prompt for it to find restaurants near you shows that it can indeed access location. That's not to mention the companies evasive answers when asked about what data the bot has access to. They claim that no new data is accessed by the bot. Which is true but amounts to nothing as users share camera, audio, location and more with the app AND THERE'S NO WAY TO HIDE THIS DATA FROM THE AI. 

Adding to the underhanded feature is the fact that you are not able to unsubscribe from the AI bot unless you pay for snap chat plus. You should not need to pay to have a feature removed.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-22T16:14:13-07:00

(1) my account has been hacked/locked many times. (2) the app doesn‚Äôt run smoothly, and sometimes glitches (3) there are many bots that send inappropriate content to your account. That is just some flaws I have seen. 
   Im not sure if this is just a one time thing or something, but as of today, Snapchat has added a ai bot feature to everyone‚Äôs accounts. I find this ai very annoying because not only is this bot pinned to the top of your chat feed, it‚Äôs also something some can‚Äôt ignore. I tested the feature out a little and I found that it slowly pressures you into telling it things. For example, the bot will ask ‚Äúcan I help with something‚Äù then if you reply ‚Äúnope bye‚Äù the bot will say ‚Äúsomething seems wrong you can tell me‚Äù which is kinda creepy because it seems like I‚Äôm giving snapchat my information‚Ä¶ snapchat! Please remove this feature!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-22T08:33:42-07:00

Without a warning or anything and that‚Äôs where I contact all my friends and family. So I was late to school. And I had over 200 streaks with people and most of them where in the 500s. All gone then when I trying to make another account or login to my second account I couldn‚Äôt do either because it wouldn‚Äôt let me. So I did the appeal and it said to wait 30 days for an email back or some information but it has been 2 months and I‚Äôm still waiting and I still can‚Äôt make another account or login to my second account because it won‚Äôt let me I had trying delete the app for a little bit and more thing and I still can‚Äôt login at all.

So I, like any normal person, was watching a good old classic horror movie(Barney), when I heard a weird gurgling noise coming from somewhere. I look down and realize it my phone üòü. So I check what‚Äôs up, Snapchat sent me a snap. I open the app, and i look in the corner to see my hot, fit, and fine self in the corner, No. That is not what I see, I see a little demon, foaming from the mouth, who looked like Rick from big mouth gurgling in the corner. As I see this my first thought isn‚Äôt what happened to this poor thing? Does it need a gofundme to get its face back to normal? NO. THAT WAS NOT MY FIRST THOUGHT. I don‚Äôt remember my first thought actually, because I past out right on the spot. I woke up later in the hospital bed, when I see it staring at me, the bitmoji that looks like it got its face sat on by a sumo wrestler.

However it has sunk to a particular kind of low by forcing a new algorithm onto its users. The ‚ÄúMy AI‚Äù bot is structured as if you are chatting with an old friend, but there‚Äôs nothing familiar or friendly about this synthetic representative. It‚Äôs scary enough that human contact was controlled so elaborately during the Covid shut down, but this version of technology is replacing our man to man fellowship altogether. The idea behind chatting apps was to be able to connect with people from far away. Snapchat mixed reality with fun by bringing into it a visual experience, then adding the silly filters we No and love. However, it‚Äôs gone completely off the deep end by prioritizing our interactions with legitimate robots rather than our loved ones. When robots become our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù we might as well resign from our work places and let them do the thinking for us.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-25T15:30:11-07:00

Love the streaks, I finally hit 1000 with my fianc√© a few months ago and was so excited. Then yesterday. 
Snapchat updated and brought the worst spam with it that CANNOT be removed unless you decide to pay for Snapchat+. This stupid AI has messed up my experience and makes me want to delete the app. Something that is in bata testing for the paywall portion of Snapchat should not be on the free side of it. As many others have said, get rid of it before you lose a whole bunch of users. 
Bring more free options back into Snapchat - like the games that have been removed, a better search function for bitmojis. I can‚Äôt find the one I want to use ever anymore. 
Just please from all us broke people out there REMOVE AI‚ÄôS PAY WALL. Make it so we can remove it if we want. There are probably some out there that love that feature but the majority of us don‚Äôt it seems like.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-21T09:24:59-07:00
