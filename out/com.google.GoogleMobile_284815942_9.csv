I frequently rely on your service for hotel searches, but I‚Äôve encountered some persistent issues that need addressing. Firstly, the filter functionality seems to be malfunctioning. For instance, when I set specific dates for my hotel stay, the system unexpectedly changes them as I browse through different hotel options. This inconsistency is quite frustrating.

Additionally, there‚Äôs a problem with the rating filter. When I specify a minimum rating of 4.0, I expect to see only hotels that meet this criterion. However, the results often include hotels with lower ratings. This not only wastes my time but also forces me to contact third-party services, which usually results in unproductive and time-consuming discussions with customer service representatives who often seem indifferent to my concerns.

I hope these issues can be resolved promptly to ensure a more efficient and user-friendly experience. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284815942&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-11T22:01:09-07:00

Page and Brin deserve everyone‚Äôs thanks everyday.  I wish there were a way like the MLB All-Star voting that the public all over the world could cast votes for Nobel Prizes for both Page and Brin.  

Under Science, the Nobel Jury needs to come up with a new category for the Cyber World.  IOW, the Nobel Prize needs to join the 21st century.  

Page and Brin deserve the first prizes.  Their innovation and inventive tools, especially Google, has probably saved lives and plenty of term papers.
