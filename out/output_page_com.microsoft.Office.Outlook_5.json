Forwarding and replying should not be a problem in a Microsoft Outlook client for mail hosted in Office365, but it is a problem and fails if the message had a signature.  You have to remove the attachment (emails with S/MIME digital signatures treat the signatures as attachments, and replying or forwarding will fail unless you remove the attachment).  Another huge problem is that this app too often it will not even show attachments let alone open them (have to use webmail OWA to properly view attachments, and may need the Okta app to do that), and the app doesn‚Äôt support S/MIME for signing and optionally encrypting new emails.  Failing with basic functionality, and missing S/MIME security options is why I rate this so low.\nNote: the desktop version of Outlook on Windows 10 will do what this mobile client fails to do.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2018-09-19T09:37:05-07:00"}]
