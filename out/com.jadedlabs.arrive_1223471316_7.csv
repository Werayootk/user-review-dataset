It‚Äôs unfortunate that Shop has decided to push this update to the user experience with no settings to allow incomplete (yet to be shipped) orders to stay at the top.

For many reasons‚Äîincluding that I have a large number of email addresses‚ÄîI can‚Äôt simply give it access to my email account. And if I did, it would only pick up emails to one address. Providing the app with my primary email address only goes so far; while that address gets more shipping notifications than any other address, it‚Äôs far from a majority.

The app would be much better if it could do two things: (1) provide each user with a unique email to which the user can forward relevant emails (compare to Evernote or Todoist) and (2) pick out multiple tracking numbers from a single, copy-pasted block of text.
