Either they leave all players dead instantly as soon as you get in to the dropship/launchpad/cafeteria. Or they hack the Host‚Äôs account and say vulgar/off the wall things without the host even typing said things out. (This happened to me when I was Host.) Another issue with a hacked game that I‚Äôve run into is the task bar being COMPLETELY FULL when I know for a fact I‚Äôve only done one or two tasks.. and so have the other Crewmates... because the game has only been going for 20 seconds. It is so frustrating and it makes me want to throw my phone out of the window when I encounter it.  I understand this may be a hard issue to fix. I don‚Äôt play any videos games besides my old Guitar Hero & Rock Band on XBox but I‚Äôm sure people hack in to all the popular games nowadays. Is there any steps we can take to prevent this from happening??? Why do people do this?? It takes all of the fun out of this amazing game.

If only Among Us had followed this philosophy. Before the update, Among Us was constantly discussed and multiple of my friends suggested that I download it. Once downloaded, I quickly realized that the game was amazing! It was a mystery game that you play with REAL PEOPLE!! It was interesting, fun and entertaining. Now, after the update, it‚Äôs hard to navigate, frustrating and way less fun. The ‚Äúaccount‚Äù rule is glitchy as my Apple ID won‚Äôt let me create an account and without an account you can‚Äôt choose your name. The other thing is the chat. Although people were able to say inappropriate things on the chat before the update, you have the option to filter out curse words. Now, the chat is hard to work with and you aren‚Äôt able to communicate what you want to by the time the clock has run out. And, now that there is only a number of things you can say, it‚Äôs very likely that you‚Äôre playing with bots. The social interaction was probably the best part of the game. It used to be a five star game, now it‚Äôs probably a two or three. I will give it three stars because it used to be amazing. Honestly, Among Us creators, you should just undo the changes.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-05T17:42:00-07:00

Quick chat just makes the game even more confusing it limits what you get to say. I know the editors of this game probably thought it was a smart idea because people were being mean and saying swearwords to each other but it‚Äôs a really bad idea because, it is more confusing than when I first got this game. I would love it if they removed the quick chat. And plus people are entering the game with their name as ‚Äúme‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù to beat the System. So you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there‚Äôs a new player in the game that doesn‚Äôt even know how to chat. When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn‚Äôt want to see swearwords or if they wanted to. How about you add an account feature where you can make an account to have friends maybe a while-playing chat feature. Please take some of these ideas into consideration because the game is so big.

If I search by number of imposter I shouldn't have to sit there and monitor if that changes or risk getting punished. Why bother having that filter if it does essentially nothing for you? Also to report players it will only let you push confirm if you don‚Äôt select why you‚Äôre reporting them. Another problem if the room owner leaves the room and you become the owner of the room it leaves the settings which is usually fine until next time you want to make your own room and now all your settings are changed even if you didn‚Äôt play a round as room owner.

Among Us is overall a great game. I love the concept and how you go about doing your tasks. But, there are a few things that need help. I would have given this game a 5 star review, but the new chat feature is strait out AWFUL. I get why they were doing this, but I don‚Äôt this was the best way to do it. We already know for a fact that Among Us can detect when someone has said an inappropriate word, because of the censored chat feature. Yes, I know the censored chat has a few bugs, like censoring things that shouldn‚Äôt be censored, but with a little bit more work, it could work flawlessly. Now, take that censored chat, and instead of just censoring it, kick out the person who would have been censored, that way, if someone says something bad, they get kicked out of the game. I like the time out feature, which also comes into play. With enough times of getting kicked for saying bad things, they get into a time out. Now, everyone can play with the regular chat and only the ones who say inappropriate things will get kicked.

Sorry for the really long review, but I think that this would really work! Please read this, Innersloth!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-03-31T07:16:47-07:00

The limitations on chat are frustrating and take all the fun out of gameplay. Might as well not talk at all! I used to play for at least an hour a day and maybe longer on weekends, but now I find myself quitting after a game or two because I‚Äôm so frustrated with the new gameplay. With multiple imposters, the game is almost impossible without a conversational chat function. My favorite feature ( connecting with other players socially) has been nerfed. I guess I‚Äôll go back to playing solitaire ü•≤

I‚Äôm also having an issue where the joystick feature/movement function gets stuck after meetings, and I have to toggle touch on and off to be able to move again. Super annoying and another great reason to just play something else, I suppose. It‚Äôs a shame, because the developers really had lightning in a bottle before. 

I just don‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind making the game less fun. Create better AI to monitor in-game chats and automatically eject bad actors from the game. Force people to connect the game to their Google or Facebook account to play to track them. I think other games have found some ways around this. Or have 12 and under rooms and adult rooms.

This defeats the whole purpose of the game if I‚Äôm not able to defend myself. It just takes the fun out of playing. If anything it‚Äôs just irritating. Instead,  would suggest that we sensor harmful words instead of just doing away with the option to chat. Not to mention that just because i‚Äôm not the age or over the age of 18, means that I‚Äôm being punished for someone else‚Äôs doing and abuse of power. I didn‚Äôt do anything. A lot of people didn‚Äôt do anything. Not only that but people over the age of 18 could abuse the fact of the chat as well. If that‚Äôs the case then we might as well just get rid of the chat all together. But again, that defeats the whole purpose of the game. In my opinion I think that the most reasonable thing to do is to sensor harmful phrases or sentences all together so people under the age of 18 can have the experience of actually being able to contribute and play the game as well.

Okay, so if I love the game so much, what are these complaints I speak of?
Well friend, I happen to have iOS 12.4 installed, and I can‚Äôt play the Airship. And EVERYONE is playing the Airship. Now, this may seem like a petty statement, but hear me out. Everyone is focused on the exciting new map, which I totally get. I‚Äôve watched too many Airship live-streams to be healthy. But this means not enough attention will be focused on the games hosted on other maps. Especially inappropriate games. The vast amount of games given sexual names is astounding and horrifying.

Also, it could be really cool if you made a chat just fir the imposters, because one time in a game, I had a secret ally who never reported, and then the other imposter killed them. So maybe it would be cool if you could chat to other imposters privately. However, if you are looking to install this game, then you should do it! It‚Äôs really fun!

It‚Äôs a lot like Murder Mystery, however instead of running around trying to find the murderer, the innocents have other stuff to do as well, like tasks and fixing sabotages. And the murderers (impostors) have more stuff they can do then kill. They close doors on you, and sabotage the ship. You can also join friends online and chat through a chat box that DOES have a sensor chat option. 
My only problems are that the usernames don‚Äôt have much restrictions, and many people join with inappropriate usernames. You also have online predators or people giving their number out. And one of the main problems are hackers. They join games and mess it up for everyone, killing people easily, controlling people, or shutting down the game so we have to find a different server. 
Otherwise, it‚Äôs a very fun game. You can‚Äôt trust anyone, not even your own friends. Some people FaceTime each other, or use discord to talk, which can be annoying because people go ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs blue, cuz my friend died, we‚Äôre talking in rl.‚Äù And then everyone gets upset because he‚Äôs ruining the game.

After school, I open the game and it‚Äôs a great stress reliever for me. I invite friends to play with me, and make new friends in some games. 

To the designers (if you‚Äôre reading this): I just have one problem. When you become a ghost, you can no longer vote. I agree that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to vote if you die because you know who the imposter is. However, I think it would be nice to be able to vote if you get voted out, because you still don‚Äôt know who the imposter is. If you get voted out, I think you should still be able to chat, but up to a limit. For example, you can only type 10 messages in the chat each meeting when you get voted out.

As a crewmate, you really get the feeling someone could kill you at any interval, and as an imposter, it‚Äôs fun to try staying undercover, and amusing to see how badly the crewmates screw up.

Idea #1, so I‚Äôve noticed that all the roles that will be coming out are all crew mate roles, maybe you could add a few imposter roles (but still keep the max amount of imposters 3) like an imposter who could drag the bodies around the map or an imposter on the side of the crew mate (it‚Äôs a crew mate role yet it has the same abilities as an imposter but it doesn‚Äôt know who the imposters are). Idea #2, maybe there could be a crew mate role like a mechanic that can fix a sabotage instantly but can only do it once per game/meeting, or a crew mate that could block the vents so the imposters can‚Äôt go to/go in the vent but it resets after every meeting and they can only do it once per meeting. Idea #3 Maybe you could add onto the skeld and Mira Hq maps because they can‚Äôt hold the new 15 players but the polus map most likely could be able to do the 15 players.

Please fix this issue. It‚Äôs not fair to penalize players from playing the game because either the game lagged and kicked them or their wifi crashed. Intentionally okay, but maybe give more than 1 warning before blocking a player from playing incase it was a wifi or system issue and not intentional or a smaller timed penalty for the first warning.

And they kill people during meetings. They gameplay over the past month has gotten mind numbingly repetitive. I wish there was a story mode where you could learn about how the impostors threatened the crewmates, and how you explore the maps doing missions. I also wish there was infinite mode, where you had to survive as a crewmate as long as possible in any map. And, finally, I would LOVE if there was currency, which could get you bonus outfits. You earn the currency by completing missions and tasks in story and infinite.

At first I didn‚Äôt really get it because I never did the ‚Äòhow to play‚Äô thing, but I caught on fast. Basically their is the crew and the imposter. The imposter is trying to kill everyone on the crew to win. The crew is trying to fix the ship while trying to find the imposter and kick him of the ship. Once they do that, the imposter is dead and they win. But along the way, they have to report bodies which activate meetings so in a chat box they can discuss who is suspicious and who they think they should vote for. Or they could skip the vote if they don‚Äôt know who to vote for. They can also activate emergency meetings if they think they know who the imposter is. If the majority votes for any person, imposter or not imposter, that person is killed. If it‚Äôs the imposter, obviously they win. But if it‚Äôs a crew member that crew member can stay on the ship as a ghost and do tasks to fix the ship, or they can leave the game. That‚Äôs the game and I find it really fun and I don‚Äôt really have any complaints.

(Edit)
so there is a new map but it‚Äôs not fair that you have to pay to play it. you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to play a map it‚Äôs not fair for those who can‚Äôt afford or can‚Äôt buy the bundle. letting only people who pay play the new map isn‚Äôt fair for the rest because we want to experience it too. i didn‚Äôt wait for a new map just to find out i can‚Äôt play it. the pay thing really brings the quality of the game down too. you don‚Äôt see good games like Breath of the Wild making you pay to access a part of the map. it‚Äôs a really scummy way to make money like i get you need to make a profit but don‚Äôt just ruin the game for the majority. please change this. it really isn‚Äôt fair.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-24T19:47:34-07:00

But there are some things that I think should be added just to improve the experience. 1. We need more maps. The map that is currently in the game is great, but there is no variety. It gets kind of stale when you are playing on the same map for an hour or two. 2. Add more jobs or stuff for the crew mates to do. The jobs are fine the way they are, but as a crewmate there seems to be nothing to do while playing. I would recommend added more jobs, making the jobs seem more minigame like,  or adding something else for the crew mates to do. 3. Add more cosmetics. It seems a bit weird to be asking for more cosmetics, but the cosmetics we have now don‚Äôt excite me. I want to see more fun and creative costumes in the game just to spice up the experience. 4. There should also be a friend system so you know when your friends are on and can join there game. 5. There needs to be a separate imposter chat so both imposters can communicate with each other. But anyways this game is great, and would definitely recommend :)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-09T23:42:25-07:00

Sadly this game doesn‚Äôt allow me to take away the feature of ‚Äúquick chat‚Äù, honestly I don‚Äôt see the point of this feature, and since it doesn‚Äôt solve any problems and ends up making more‚Ä¶ why should Among us have it. Truly all of my friends and youtubers play Among Us and it looks like a fun game but‚Ä¶(here‚Äôs a big but) I can‚Äôt chat with the people in game nor can I change my name and many more, (that I can‚Äôt think of because I never got to play the game.) I‚Äôve played this game before and I could chat and all in all it was fun (I played like 3 times‚Ä¶ but still fun,) but when I decided I wanted to give it a shot again I found out that I couldn‚Äôt chat! It was very alarming, you see I‚Äôve tried searching up reasons and answers of why that was happening but, I only found out it was impossible to delete this major issue. So I ultimately gave up on the game in general. Having a new update in a game is cool but, if it makes a problem why have the new feature. I think this game would be much better, would attract many more people, (and maybe I might have even liked the game,) if this feature were removed, and because of this feature I wish I could rate this game a 0.

7219383301,MidnightCanine89,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id684558721,2021.4.12,2,Amazing game....but the update needs fixes immediately,"Among us was one of my favorite games to play with friends before the update. We would play it all the time online, but because the creator did not allow the game to connect with most Apple ID, especially iPad, you could not make an account. I could not play unless my friends were right next to me and we played local, but that was a rare occurrence. I understand they make ‚Äòguest‚Äô mode on it now, but even then, it would not let you customize your name or type in the chat. You could only use the chat button update on the side, and that was super annoying too. It was like you had a limited dialogue. So in summary, I miss playing, and I tried to fix it for TWO HOURS, and looked it up several times, but apparently it is the developers issue, because over hundreds of people have written online on multiple websites that pop up right away on search, and even the people who know everything about computers admitted it‚Äôs not the Apple device‚Äôs or the Apple owner‚Äôs fault the game was made not so friendly for Apple ID. I wish they would fix this, but developers don‚Äôt usually care, so ya. For anyone who can make an account, the game is very fun though and I bet you‚Äôre allowed to type.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-13T17:32:51-07:00

If and when a hacker has been recognized by the game ban them from the server and give them a warning, if they hack again, shut their game down COMPLETELY I mean don‚Äôt let them use the app at all, like if they open it it won‚Äôt even work. I also suggest more than a 100 character chat limit, it‚Äôs kinda long I know but it‚Äôs useful to talk with more than 100 characters per 2 minutes. The last thing I suggest is the ability to search for games with a certain name instead of having to scroll, this can cause friendships by being able to find a server with similar interests, it can have the same refresh type organization to it except the fact that you can look up certain names to find servers with similar names. This is a great game and this is just my opinion on what would make the game a lot more fun and active, this isn‚Äôt a need, or must, it‚Äôs just a friendly suggestion, meaning I don‚Äôt really plan on seeing these added since there are so many reviews.

I faked my age so I could chat freely, because my sister said it asked for her age. I hate this new update. Please take it away. Its now obvious to see who is over 18 or who had faked their age. The new feature is annoying because it takes so long to find what you need in all the categories. Everyone is so used to saying each others colors, But now you dont have that option. Please take the feature away. Its more boring and less fun to play. Ive spent money on this game and now I might quit. Please read this review and TAKE THE FEATURE AWAY. The polis map is really weird looking and annoying now. Also the glitching of when I try to sabotage or look at the map. I play on mobile so its really bad. Also it is harder to say ‚ÄúWhere was the body‚Äù and all that because of the chat feature. The polis map looks so different. Ive never been a fan of the maps. Also when you click ‚Äúlocation‚Äù in the lobby(chat feature) It said Mira and Laptop... What map is Mira? And what Map is Laptop? Please fix this. Also because of your bad update more people are quitting so it is harder to start a full game. Thank you bye

1.The cussing...I know there‚Äôs a lot of adults but I‚Äôm a kid,and their might be other kids to. And have you ever thought that the among us players could cuss or say inappropriate stuff in front of CHILDREN!? 2.No reason banning
Okay so,sometimes when I‚Äôm in a game I literally do nothing. Then in a 1.2 seconds (sometimes) I get banned,for no reason!!!! I think you should add this thing before they ban or kick someone,I think it should be said ‚ÄúYou have no reason to ban this person.‚Äù At least,make a server for kids and teens and adults. :( Overall this game is pretty good. I hope you make these updates in the future. Oh and also every time I join a game it like says that the game already started...even if it said its 2 players!!! Or it says the room is full. That‚Äôs the most annoying thing!

Okay I just came back from playing your game and I was waiting for poeple to join I was just changing my games settings when it said stop hacking your banned from the server please i did not do anything but if that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt know about hacking by changing settings please tell me (btw you lied about age 9 swearing not for lil children!)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-12T20:08:10-07:00
