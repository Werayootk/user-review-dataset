I love shein and I’ve probably spent thousands of dollars on shein through this account and my parents. My family is not one that is in the position that they can only afford certain things but if ur family is this will def help, u can buy so much stuff and the more u spent the more u save, my orders would sometimes be around 400 give or take and I could get an easy 90-80 dollars off making much of the items free. Most of it is good quality just make sure I read the reviews and look at the review pictures to make sure u still like it. OH also, very important, LEARN UR MEASUREMENTS!!! It’s very important def when using a website importing cloths from their country to yours, sometimes sizes are different than the sizes in ur area so just remember to check. Most of my stuff was good, a recent order didn’t send one of my skirts but I think the chance of this happening is low since it’s only happened once last week.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-04T20:17:57-07:00"},{"id":"6284101422","userName":"Malia J.","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1188580077","version":"7.2.1","score":2,"title":"Cute clothes but everything else is frustrating","text":"I love the items there. However, the shipping is unreasonable. It costs a lot, first off. And if you don't pay like $15 for express shipping, you'll be waiting a while for your items(s). As far as the app itself, its easy to navigate but some features are useless. For example, I don't get the points feature. We earn points but can't even use them all at check out, we can only use a portion. That's stupid, it's like you want us to come out of our pocket every check out, despite us being loyal app members and earning our points to be able to use them to purchase our order solely with our points. Also, another thing that ticks me off is the whole trial report. It's impossible to get picked if you don't have a higher level, yet they don't even explain how to get a higher membership level. I've spent hundreds with Shein, and I'm not a higher level. Something tells me you'd have to pay to be a higher level, and if that's the case, that's ridiculous. \n\nSo in conclusion, the items are great and worth the money.

Absurd and frustrating.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-05T12:51:50-07:00"},{"id":"3051122662","userName":"Lle-prom","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id701576466","version":"6.2.5","score":2,"title":"Customer Service","text":"SHEIN overall has pretty good merchandise, good options, great prices. The down side is that it doesn’t specify that this is an international web based only store and as you can imagine customer service is pretty much inexistent... if you have a question, a concern or simply need help, it is all handled through chat (calling doesn’t really do much neither) which always has long wait times, and lately after waiting ur turn in line for a representative to be available the chat will kick you out their wait data base, in other words you have to wait all over again... I for instance experienced this chat issue 3 times last night and have yet to be connected with an associate.. Another down side is if you have items in your cart and are in the process of checking out you go back to the cart or exit out of the checkout process to review the items, your cart items will be completely removed, losing your entire merchandise.

Easy return process if needed, first return label is free per order, so make sure to try on everything in that order, before you request any returns. I hadn’t needed to contact customer service yet, all questions are answered on the site. They also offer four interest free payments which is yet another great thing I love!!! Shipment is taking a little longer due to these times, my coworker said it normally takes up to two weeks. I can say that the shipment notification is ny more than a 2-3 days after ordering, so that is great also! There are so many styles of clothes, dressy and casual, as well as items for the home!!!

I chose resend, they then notified me that my items were out of stock and I would have to select other items at a different price.

No customer service over the phone only through a chat which is super inconvenient in my opinion. The person or whoever I spoke to was absolutely rude. They didn’t care that the product was damaged and she insisted I return it which I have no problem with if they provided a label for it in the package or mailed to me as many other companies do. So at this point I have a shirt that is trash and they kept my money. They offer products for a lower price because they pay their employees very low wages. I really wish I would have done my research before. Do your research and google them! Don’t listen to people who promote them on social media because they get paid.

My favorite part about the app is other purchasers will review items and post pictures so you can really see what the quality is like and how it will fit before you order.

It also gives me confidence in my purchase and shows the company isn’t afraid for their potential customers to see what other customers are saying about their products.\nI also love that I have all the coupon options available for you to see at the check out. With other brands I end up doing so much searching to try and find the best deal and this makes it so much more simple.

The only reason I give it one star is how the models and the sizes are. Almost the models are photoshopped and airbrushed to this unrealistic, unachievable body standard that is toxic and misleading. As someone who sees the effects that unreasonable body standards can have on people practically every day, it can cause severe depression, among other more serious things. Almost all models have a skinny waste, Kim Kardashian-like behind, and a huge chest. A lot of people don’t have these traits so stop making it look like it’s the norm. Furthermore, the Curve + Plus category is often wrongly categorized. The models here are often more like the average woman, so stop making the normal people (pretty much everybody) feel bad about themselves.

They didn’t have any dents, or discoloration, or even and chipping. I was extremely impressed. My only complaint is the shipping time, which usually takes anywhere from a week to a month to get to you (if you live in the US). I received everything in immaculate condition, no smushed box/bag, no holes or anything. I love the format of the website too it makes shopping for specific things such a breeze. You will find out though, even with those premade categories everything on their website available for purchase isn’t in them.

Always flowy and floral printed, but once you go to the small women’s section, they have all of the latest fashion trends ran in smaller sizes and do not have a plus size version of it. This is the same with SHEIN. Another complaint that I have is the shoes do not go up to larger sizes, and because of this, I would have to go shop at shoe stores in person. I am a plus size woman cursed with larger feet as well, and it would have been nice to have cute shoes that also ran in larger sizes.

The lingerie is super cute and very welll made. Their socks are cute and comfortable. Recently I’ve purchased handbags, wallets, a glass screen protector (really does the job like the $50 dollar ones& I got it for 2$), phone cases and those little things that go in the back the pop socket. The whole website is super affordable. They always have sales and good coupons to use. They also offer after pay and Klarna which lets you make payments on your purchases. I love that my items usually come early (: I’ve told people to shop from here cus it’s affordable and I love all their stuff. They give points every day. You can get point in other different ways too. Overall it’s a good retail app. Their a really good company. Love them ❤️","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-12-18T12:47:40-07:00"},{"id":"7464228229","userName":"annyccmarie","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1202325898","version":"7.6.2","score":3,"title":"SHIEN is wonderful, but has a long way to go.","text":"SHIEN has been amazing for me in the sense that now finally I can afford clothing! Before, I mostly had handmedowns and thrifted clothes or have to wait for birthdays or Christmas, now I can choose clothing that fits my style and doesn’t take all of my money! The issues: a lot of their designs are stolen from random places on the internet, plus sized women are very clearly not catered to the same way as the “women’s” section, SHIEN X is very clearly just for skinny people! Almost no plus sizes ever! Using barely plus sized models for their plus section while also giving them less options. Here’s an idea- get rid of the plus size section. Separating “plus size” from “women” firstly is offensive because it implies we aren’t women, and also why make different clothes for us all?? Just offer the same clothes in bigger sizes it’s very simple. In conclusion, I like SHIEN as it has helped me be able to afford clothing, is fast and the app is easy to use. However, it desperately needs some updating and ethics.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-14T08:36:20-07:00"},{"id":"7399376040","userName":"NMEB90","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1171648439","version":"7.5.8","score":1,"title":"Never Again!","text":"I have heard nothing but great things about SHEIN and I have tried ordering before but NEVER received a package. So I figured to give them one more shot, figuring since they’ve grown, maybe their have gotten better with delivery. Nope!!!\n\nI’m totally I have placed 4 orders with them and I haven’t received a single one. The most recent I even payed for expedited shipping, it took 2 months for them to send the email that it will be delayed. Well duh, I figured that about two weeks after I placed my order and never received my shipment. I tried contacting and getting an update and I didn’t receive any information and it was impossible to get connected with anyone. I figured, I’ll wait but when I finally got the update 2 months later, I was done waiting. I asked for a refund and it took me another month to get that. \n\nYes they have cute close in theory, but it’s only a photo on the internet and disappointment. I am done trying and don’t recommend this for anyone. This is terrible service and evident they do not care about their customers enough to even respond. I don’t want anyone to have to experience the ordeal I have.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-28T12:17:00-07:00"},{"id":"8897666790","userName":"Bjakamrb","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id220600589","version":"8.3.4","score":5,"title":"Affordable and durable","text":"I have shopped on shein for years now and love it. I was never a person to buy clothes especially clothes online, but ever since I got into shopping at shein 90% of my shopping I do there. The only thing you have to be careful about is the sizing because they are not always true to size, but as many orders as I’ve gotten I’ve only had one maybe two items that didn’t fit me. Out of the tons of things I’ve gotten from there. The key to shopping here is reading other peoples reviews and looking at the pictures of how it fit them regardless of what you think your size may be. Quality also is usually on the better side although some of it is not the best. Rarely do I get low quality. I’ve also recommended or influenced a lot of people around me to shop here as well and they love it too. 100% would recommend smaller and bigger people to shop here!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-21T11:48:25-07:00"},{"id":"7437737568","userName":"Jewelslovee","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id437887604","version":"7.6.1","score":5,"title":"Best app to buy cute clothes","text":"Super cute and super affordable clothes. Has not let me down yet with their selection. Clothes arrive within 10 days from order or so. To be very honest, my orders arrive a lot sooner but depends on where you live. Reviews of clothing are very true and SHEIN does not filter out bad ones. When shopping I suggest you look into the size conversion they offer, material description plus read reviews based off size you’re inquiring about. Have made about 20 orders since June and only one needed to be returned. Their live chat with a SHEIN representative made the return process a BREEZE ! If you have kids I recommend checking out their kids clothing for some super cute outfits that you can also match with adult options. My two boys and I get all our matching outfits from this company. And again, having made about 10 kids orders from this app.... have not been disappointed yet!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-07T08:52:39-07:00"},{"id":"5986278389","userName":"Lilly_100278","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id747754016","version":"7.0.8","score":1,"title":"I do not recommend SHEIN","text":"My experience with shein hasn’t been all that pleasant. A couple days ago, my friends phone kept getting hacked into ever since she downloaded the app. Once it was deleted everything was fine. She also had ordered an outfit. It took about 3 weeks to arrive and the quality and material was not it at all. As for my order. I had ordered an outfit as well. For about a week or so, my order continued to be processed and I didn’t understand why. So I messaged customer service and they refunded me one item. I repurchased the item because I really liked it. There was more complications with it as it was taking a very long time. I have not received any tracking updates on my order or any sort of information as to why it is taking so long. I once again try to reach out but I would have to wait 2 days which is ridiculous. No one had the answers to my questions. Every response was vague. At this point I feel like they scammed me. I really do not recommend this app at all. They have very nice clothing and accessories but do not be fooled by the image of the picture because once it actually comes it will be something completely different.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-05-23T21:06:51-07:00"},{"id":"4511339992","userName":"EPIC01!","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id414684245","version":"6.7.1","score":4,"title":"Faithful Shein Customer","text":"I have loved Shein since I first ordered clothes off the website. Of course there are some things I’ve learned over the time of my countless purchases: be careful ordering things that can’t be returned (swimsuits for example), the shipping can take anywhere from 1 1/2 weeks to 6 weeks depending on where you live, and take advantage of the points you collect and check in daily to earn more. I’d say I’m around 85% happy with the purchases I’ve made; Shein t-shirts make up most of my wardrobe. The trial center is also fun and allows you to get clothes for free, but I am disappointed because since the update I can’t access the trial center. On “your page” where you can access your cart, wishlist, past purchases, etc. there is a button that says “My Free Trial” and it worked great until the update. Now when you click on it it just says the items you’ve applied for and you can’t apply for any more. Besides that, Shein is amazing and I absolutely love (most) of the clothes!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=878577184&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-07-24T10:04:02-07:00"}]
