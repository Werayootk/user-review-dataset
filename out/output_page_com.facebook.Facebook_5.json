One of the negative is the control that Facebook tries to put on its members. I don’t always feel that it’s free speech. I often get suggestions of people I know with whom to befriend to  and I’m already friends on Facebook, and it worries me that there’s too much spam going around. I once had this ongoing discussion with somebody who said they were who they were not which in time, I was able to find out. Happened again recently with someone who had the right picture the right name and I thought I was talking to my friend and then they wanted to know if I was interested in making a lot of money and I knew right then and there it was a spam or scam.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-24T09:29:55-07:00"},{"id":"7487432199","userName":"LadyJ333","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1212928189","version":"322.0","score":1,"title":"It’s ridiculous","text":"They are so ridiculous now.

I was under the impression that fascism was a right wing ideology, but clearly that’s not the truth as Facebook is notoriously left leaning and is taking notes straight from the fascist’s playbook. The hilarity of it all is overshadowed by the sinister nature of the app and the way the so called “community standards” are set up. Facebook could care less about free speech if that speech opposes their own views and bias. Reading the reviews, it’s become apparent that this is a very large issue that is affecting very many people around the world. A place that once used to promote open discussion has not turned into an echo chamber of groupthink. I guess if Facebook wants to shout themselves in the foot and destroy their social network that they created, they’re free to do so and they’re incredibly competent at doing just that!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-03T13:38:32-07:00"},{"id":"7382781062","userName":"BalsleyGirl","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1292748874","version":"319.0","score":1,"title":"To be honest, it’s horrible;cyberprison","text":"Facebook has grown stronger in censoring what you say.

I will not use any advertisers that you recommend shame on Facebook. It gets more fraudulent every day!!! That company does not have a phone number. You can call to talk to customer service so it is hard to reach them! You need to make sure before you put that stuff on this site that they are reputable you use and promote sites and companies from China. I hate China they only want to screw over Americans and you should know that I’m really considering deleting Facebook. if you cannot stand behind a quality product and company, you have no business putting that out to the public but you are a liberal site. I guess I should expect it.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-27T03:59:40-07:00"},{"id":"9562203612","userName":"Egirl96","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id367736475","version":"399.0","score":1,"title":"They banned me and I lost all of my pictures and videos","text":"I had Facebook for 13 years. 13 years worth of memories, pictures, and videos. 13 years all gone in 12 hours. In that time my account got hacked, they posted something that went against guidelines, and then my account was banned. I tried to refute it and immediately after I got an email saying their decision was final. I tried to download all my pictures and videos (as they told me I could) and it crashed every time. \nI lost everything. I honestly am devastated. Maybe it’s a shame on me for not saving everything from 8th grade until now being 26 years old, but SHAME on Facebook for not reviewing things and banning someone who was a committed user for over 13 years. I was not given a chance at all and then lost countless memories. \nAll I want is my pictures and videos back. I could deal with it if that was the case, but I never expected Facebook to ban me and then give me no chance to show them that it was a hacker. \nShame on you Facebook. You’ve lost me forever. \nIf you wanna make it right (which you probably could care less) give me my pictures and videos. That’s all I want.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-29T18:22:37-07:00"},{"id":"8045559836","userName":"Crimsonclay","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id215758080","version":"343.1","score":5,"title":"Government Tentacle","text":"FB has just become another sub corporation of the tyrannical US government. Free speech is censored without shame, groups are targeted and dismantled, and individual accounts are shadow banned or just deleted altogether. In my particular case, FB deleted a group I helped to admin, then suspiciously reinstated it. Next thing I know my very secure account was ‘hacked’ by a bot and fb wanted private personal info from me just to attempt to recover it. All that to say, I was already done with fb. It was good 7 years ago when people were allowed to congregate online and have free speech, but now it’s just a retarded circus. FB did me a favor. Happy to be done with it, but sad to lose so many connections and information I had on it. 2 out of 5 stars for the biggest social media app in the world? Wow, this should be a lesson to everyone, this country has reached a dire condition when the government and corporate america get in bed together to suffocate the people.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-11-20T15:14:42-07:00"},{"id":"8912026225","userName":"Sharday 17930708","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id537380001","version":"376.0","score":1,"title":"Mandatory update","text":"I am currently in South Korea and As of July 26, today, the app is not letting me scroll on Facebook or even post. It’s not letting message on messenger, or even open it for that matter, before I get a message on my screen that says it is mandatory that I share my personal information including my location in order to use Facebook/messenger. When I choose to exit out of the message it says I have to agree to the terms or deactivate or delete my entire Facebook page. My concern and question is why do I have to give up my personal information, just to use a social media app? Why is it not my decision on whether or not I want to share it? Why is it being made mandatory to give up MY information JUST to use Facebook? This isn’t making any sense. And I have asked my family back in the states if they have the same issue and they are all saying no, it’s not happening there. So that bring me to my next question, is it only happening here? And if so, WHY? We already post pictures and statuses on Facebook, our name is up there, why do you want us to go IN DEPTH with OUR personal information just to use Facebook?

Sometimes I’ll be scrolling through and the whole app will turn gray and lock up which forces me to close the app wait a second and then reopen it. The app in general just seems laggy and not as smooth as it could be. I also have several issues cropping issues. Posts being to far to the right or left so you can’t read the whole post etc. marketplace is also very glitchy crashes a lot whenever I am trying to post a listing. I have the iPhone 13 pro only a few months old so I shouldn’t be having any issues like this. Facebook also seems to drain my battery really bad. I feel like Facebook eats up more power than other apps I use about the same amount of time. Obviously there’s lots of factors to battery life but being the glitches and lag I’m experiencing I’m guessing this app isn’t as optimized as it should be which is sad for a company as big as meta they should be able to hire plenty of developers to make a smooth running efficient app","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-13T08:56:16-07:00"},{"id":"7610679051","userName":"Coach Vint","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id116750479","version":"328.0","score":1,"title":"Don’t Give Them Money","text":"Use Facebook for several years both personally and professionally. I managed a paged for a charitable foundation as well. I purchased ads at times to generate more views of posts. Last week I was hacked. I received a notification that my account was disabled. I went through the process of verifying who I was, which included scanning my ID. I received an email from Facebook that said they verified my ID and I should be able to login. I went through two step authentication, and when they wanted to do a security check there was an error. While doing that my bank was billed $50 by Facebook, because whoever hacked me used my Facebook ad account to buy ads for their fraudulent posts. I contested, but since the bank says the ads are auto-billed, there is nothing they can do. Facebook and no customer service. Emails do not get answered. I have filled out their form to report a problem multiple times. Nothing. Still locked out. I talked with others who went through the same thing. They had to build a new account. This is crap. For one of the biggest, most powerful companies, they sure have crappy service.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-07-23T16:59:36-07:00"},{"id":"7403385415","userName":"Dr.AZ","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id87095553","version":"320.0","score":1,"title":"One star for bias and injustice","text":"I’ve been a loyal Facebook member for over a decade. For the first time ever, one of my comments get blocked, when it was a simple expression of support for my family in Palestine. I criticized Israel and wrote very specifically that my criticism is not against Jews or Judaism, but the acts of the Zionists in my land. The bias demonstrated by Facebook and the double standards in allowing some to express their view points but not others was disgusting. There is nothing worse than injustice. Since when does Facebook control free speech. My comment and posts were not hate speech, they were not anti-Semitic, they were not rude, cruel, or vulgar. They were my position supporting Palestine and Palestinians against the war machine of Israel. I was and still am against the inhumane use of indiscriminate and non-proportional use of force against the civilian population in Gaza. Who are you to dictate what my opinion is. Where were you when we witnessed people using your stage to spread lies and fake news and you defended their right of speech. Don’t talk to me about algorithms as if to scare me with big words. I have a PhD in ChemE and lead a 100+ group of data scientists.

Even though we may not believe the same things and may have different views on things such as religion, politics, war, etc., that didn’t matter to me and it still doesn’t. I do not care about your views. I will listen to them and respect them and even in some circumstances I will debate but only if asked and then agree to disagree before the conversation turns hostile. This app does not care about freedom of speech and will censor anyone who it’s creator disagrees with. There is no room anymore for discussions on this app and there never will be again. I know that this review will not stop anyone from using the app and it probably won’t stop myself either as my entire family and all of my friends use this app. My problems with the app stem from bigger issues in the world and this app just so happens to allow those issues within its content.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-26T15:31:07-07:00"},{"id":"6230676845","userName":"Yup23765","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id117333124","version":"279.0","score":1,"title":"Why are you continually making it harder to sync my events to my iCalendar?!?!","text":"Seriously!?!? I want my whole schedule in ONE place, home, work, fun, and that’s not going to be the Facebook events tab, so if you think I’m going to keep using that to setup, find or advocate for using events, you better go back to making it easier to sync with the iFamily of computing. It used to just automatically sync everything from FB to iCal, no problem. Then about 8-9 months ago, that stopped, and I had to either manually sync events one by one from my phone, or go to a web version of FB, find my calendar, and manually tell it to sync all. And even that doesn’t update any events, which is a pita. 😠 My main device is an iPad. Do you understand the PITA it is to convince safari to fun a web based version of a site? \n\nNow you’ve gone and “improved” your surfing experience, AND I CAN NO LONGER FIND THE OPTION TO SYNC MY CALENDAR AT ALL. I have already started using other programs to schedule events for my activities that are more user friendly to all OS’s. And I will be recommending to others to do the same.
