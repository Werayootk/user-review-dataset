Some political, social, and sometimes educational conversation can’t  be done without basic grammar can’t be expressed because of YouTube’s sensitivity policies. Some of which don’t even accomplish the intended goal of protecting anyone. Some comment sections are turned off without any explanation. The reasoning being because of content coded to be children because it’s animation when the content itself is really for all or older ages. People are self censoring which is confusing because it doesn’t help anyone nor does it remove the potentially harmful effects the video can induce because of the subject in of itself can still be triggering which means it must either be removed in its entirety or people will have to choose to not watch it at all regarding the censorship pointless.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T15:22:04-07:00
