Some political, social, and sometimes educational conversation can‚Äôt  be done without basic grammar can‚Äôt be expressed because of YouTube‚Äôs sensitivity policies. Some of which don‚Äôt even accomplish the intended goal of protecting anyone. Some comment sections are turned off without any explanation. The reasoning being because of content coded to be children because it‚Äôs animation when the content itself is really for all or older ages. People are self censoring which is confusing because it doesn‚Äôt help anyone nor does it remove the potentially harmful effects the video can induce because of the subject in of itself can still be triggering which means it must either be removed in its entirety or people will have to choose to not watch it at all regarding the censorship pointless.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=544007664&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-17T15:22:04-07:00
