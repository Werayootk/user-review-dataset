I’ve been messaging them weekly at this point to go ahead and cancel the account. I understand 3-5 day verification. But this? Unacceptable. None of the assistance has given me a reason to trust that they are “working on it.” if you can’t verify my identity in a whole month, why would I trust you with my money?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-05-11T18:59:24-07:00"},{"id":"8751117376","userName":"Firstfret","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id163153072","version":"8.56","score":1,"title":"Couldn’t even sign up, nonexistent support","text":"Tried to sign up several times but kept failing the identity check.

However, it looks like a Revolut USD account is just an account in Great Britain that is held in dollars. This means that to transfer USD I am still doing an international wire transfer, which is slow and expensive. What I need is a U.S. banking routing number and account number, so I can deposit money directly as a domestic transfer.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=932493382&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-11T05:56:49-07:00"},{"id":"7467536301","userName":"dbwoods11","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id35465234","version":"8.7.1","score":2,"title":"Metal customers “priority support” is not true","text":"I’ve been a paying Metal customer (highest level).
