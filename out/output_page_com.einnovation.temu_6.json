I would have been content just from that experience alone. But why the '1 star' you ask? The TEMU gift card. This is so irresponsibly done that you ALL should be ashamed of yourselves. I logged in to a notification that stated your intent to give me 3 free gifts. So I'm spending an hour scrolling through carefully selecting 1 item from 3 cost levels. When I get done, Your site launches another screen that do a shell game with each of my desired picks. And, if I don't select the right choice, I lose what I picked. Luckily I got 2 out of 3, offering a 60% off. But, it doesn't end there. The choices that I did select were not given because I didn't want to go with 60% since it was initially 'supposed' to be a gift. So, I'm very disappointed. How can I TRUST a company that would promise me gifts THEN I discover these gifts can ONLY be obtained through a 2-bit shell game. Then, if I'm not already disgusted by this business practice after losing one item playing this game you offer me 60% off for it?!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-01-06T10:57:27-07:00"},{"id":"9259827719","userName":"MO.

For example first person I invited got me $2, but as I got closer to the amount I needed I earned less, and the last invitee got me only $.70. Then one of the new user invitees received my invite, clicked on it and set up an account but I never received ANY credit for that and their link says “invite already accepted” \nThe fine print says if you send too many invites or a person receives too many invites the invites become invalid but they NEVER TELL YOU what number is too many.

This place definitely has deals worth bragging about. \n\nMy two stars refer to the bold marketing. Similar to a pyramid scheme, promises of endless free gifts are presented through their mini games. Seemingly attainable, their farm, fish, dart, and hat mini games offer a free gift. To keep you hooked, while you approach your goals they tack on more “free gifts”. I’ve successfully invited new users but to no avail. The quests become increasingly harder. The final fish food percentage drops down to a whopping .01%. You’d have to successfully invite 5-10 new users to obtain your promised free gifts. I am on the final day for fishland and I can clearly see its just a pipe dream. For the hat game they promised enough energy to flip the final card if I invited one more user. I did. And I received 1 energy as opposed to the promised amount. \n\nThis is obviously a gimmick and their way to rake in new users to try and get more customers. While I do appreciate the deals I feel the games should stop promoting free gifts. They claim there are successful users who received all their gifts but what are the chances those aren’t just the same influencers who are promoting their invite codes. Either stop promoting free gifts or actually make them attainable. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend playing any of their games as you are simply giving them free publicity with nothing in return.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-05-10T14:21:51-07:00"},{"id":"9905365952","userName":"Kim-my2021","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id528666663","version":"1.68.0","score":2,"title":"So here’s my reason for a 2","text":"Hook line and sinker.

But they offer a credit to bring you back to the site . So now your like ok I have 5$ and you spend more. It's a big scam that's how they keep their prices low because they are keeping so much cash on the back end. And it’s always free shipping the timer in their site just restarts when it runs out.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-26T17:02:39-07:00"},{"id":"9750479699","userName":"ft yzethdxtj5","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1366664433","version":"1.56.0","score":4,"title":"temu PLS","text":"ok temu is not bad actually i haven’t ordered anything yet but i see all reviews on tiktok it sounds good my friends use it the only problem i have with temu is that it’s not being fair every time i play a game to get a free gift i can never get it because i don’t have people to share this with no one really has the app and they think it’s a scam and when i share the game lowers my chances of getting the free gift and it’s really annoying and the dates on the package is confusing sometimes when my friend ordered it on the 10th it was expected on the 27th-30th it came on the 4th so idk temu can we pls just get the package the day it is expected and temu can u pls make the games fair or give us a chance to get the 3rd free package without sharing it’s just super unfair and it should be that when u can’t get the third one can only get the 2 i earned so pls temu do better.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-25T07:14:59-07:00"},{"id":"10417265193","userName":"Meganlindsayj","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id129160187","version":"2.8.0","score":5,"title":"Great items, customer service, deals!","text":"Customer service is just the best, they really take care of their customers. Giant selection of fun items and clothes at good prices. Surprisingly decent quality too, most of the time. I’ve had a few issues with returns and shipping but Temu was super quick to help and make things right. I’ve continued to purchase because of how happy I am with their selection, prices, and especially the customer service and deals. Functionally, the app works well and I haven’t had issues with glitches. It is kind of an endless scroll setup with unlimited recommendations that can get repetitive, but it’s fun to browse! So many unique items you can’t get elsewhere. Shipping is slow but so far everything has arrived eventually in mostly fair condition.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-09-28T14:05:27-07:00"},{"id":"10091307955","userName":"Hcjeixnwidb","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id435062171","version":"1.81.0","score":3,"title":"Only good first 2 purchases","text":"When you’re a new user you get one item for cheap and then 2 free items and your next purchase is 2 items cheap and 3 free. That is an amazing deal however don’t expect to get anything out of the games they’re incredibly RIGGED can’t tell you how many times it would tell me if I got this many points it would be complete and it wouldn’t be. Told me if I got enough coins I would get 2 dollars which would get me to my 150 reward. When I got the coins it only gave me 50 cents when it said 2 dollars so I’m still 50 cents away from the award that can only be redeemed if you invite someone that has never had the app before. It’s good for the first two purchases so make it count because you won’t get anything after like advertised. Also when you click back on a game they will advertise how to get more coins 3-4 times before it will actually let you back out.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-06-30T23:45:05-07:00"},{"id":"10179038757","userName":"Lalalalallettyufg","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id937103964","version":"1.89.1","score":1,"title":"Bad service and the bad app","text":"I do not like this app because it tells me that I can get at least $100 worth of stuff and you know what I had to do. I had to put in my address and I didn’t get anything. I just tried inviting people and inviting people and when I got to the last person, I told me to add more five more people. do you know that’s ridiculous you know I spend hours and hours and hours on the app and it doesn’t give me nothing and people are not liking that especially my friend and also I hate the fact that he told me that I can get at least two free stuff from the app and you know what I had to do again put in my address and play a game and you know what I had to do play the game and again, and again, and again and again, and you know what I got nothing so with that type of stuff I do not like but with the other stuff it’s good that’s good customer service good shipping and stuff and yeah I just do not like the hundred dollar worth stuff for the free stuff because it’s not true in my eyes","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-07-24T22:49:49-07:00"}]
