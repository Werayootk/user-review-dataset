This is happened to me twice. Uber should create some flag to identify when a driver cancels a trip instead of erroneously punishing the customer by charging a $5 cancellation fee. This is extremely inconvenient for the customer because the customer has to write a complaint to seek a refund. If the customer is too busy and doesn’t have time to write to customer service, then Uber gets to keep the money they incorrectly took from the customer. Additionally, last year Uber’s bot response was so flawed because instead of using me a refund, I was blamed for the driver cancelling my time when I waited for him the entire time. Not only did I wasted my time waiting for him, I was charged $5 when he cancelled. This further delayed my trip. Uber used to be held at a higher customer service standard but now they just don’t seem to get their business model right.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-01-12T03:15:40-07:00

Not fair to the drivers, also not paying them for gas as they should, they’re getting paid way less than what they use to and that wasn’t even enough (I’m just a rider , not a driver myself I don’t even have a car hence all the rides I take , but being in all the Ubers and Lyfts  I have I talk to many drivers about the pros and cons of their jobs and you’d be so surprised by a lot of what they tell you ) Uber needs to do better honestly, they make WAYY to much money to be running things the way they are .

Ever since they recently priced their rides on a scale instead of a set price, I’m getting charged much more and I can’t even see why. I used to be charged 14-15 dollars to get to work every day without fail. Now, with the exact same route, it’s 16-17.

It still doesn’t explain why I’m getting charged a couple dollars more when I joined a rewards program to avoid this very thing. What was the point of me doing that when all the “rewards” have now been taken away?

However, having recently encountered a technological issue I can’t give this app the 5 stars I’d like to. 
My girlfriend ordered us an Uber and for some reason, the gps had us in a different location than we were. The Uber driver called us and we explained exactly where we were to him several times. He arrived late- which is okay. However we were later charged a late fee for something that was clearly outside of our ability to control. 
When I tried to challenge the charge through the app, it was immediately denied. I’ve attempted finding a way of calling Uber to dispute this charge, but could not find any helpline. 
Any company that can’t offer me a way to contact them directly about issues doesn’t deserve 5 stars regardless of how good the app is. The customer service is horrible. My driver, I’m assuming charged us for something we didn’t do (we were waiting outside for him for about 7 minutes), and yet we’re stuck with an extra charge and no way to explain our issue.

Screen shot every step of your trip scheduling. Uber has changed prices, locations, etc...on the final receipt and there is no way to reach someone in customer service to resolve any issues. The Help section of the app is an absolute nightmare to navigate and Uber’s idea of providing customer service and support is a joke. I use them only as a last resort as taxis are more reliable and issues can be resolved through an actual customer service rep. The only good thing I can say about Uber is the quality of drivers. But, Uber itself is horrible!

(Update: Based on the developer response, I see that they still don’t understand that the Help section and the level of customer support are the main reason I gave the bad review. Apparently the only way to receive decent customer support is to give the App itself a bad review.  There are other ride options, with similar or better pricing, and with actual customer support should there be an issue. 
One more issue to note: the GPS that the drivers are made to use is HORRIBLE. Maybe Uber should use the WAZE app for its drivers as Waze’s GPS system has been for the most much more reliable!)",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-04T05:49:30-07:00

Their driver support is purely an informational service that sees the system that is malfunctioning as some sort of untouchable deity. They used to have a phone number for the passengers who had issues as well to receive support but that is gone away now and I’m thinking their service will likely start to die away if they don’t start treating drivers well. Also many customers are unaware of the ratings system used. If a driver falls below 4.6 rating they permanently deactivate that driver and refuse to reactivate them later or even allow for any sort of appeal to the unfair ratings. They take the passengers word over the drivers and won’t even listen to both sides of the story before making a judgement regarding that decision.

I can rate the driver, but I can’t tip. It’s a big issue because not being able to tip has plummeted my rating. I am otherwise a pleasant passenger and yet my score has been gradually going down. Having a lower score impacts on the types of drivers I get or if drivers even want to take my request. Whenever I remember I bring cash to tip drivers because the app won’t let me, but it’s 2020 I should be able to tip in the app. Other than tipping and Uber support not helping me fix this issue the app has been okay.

While I would have supported this change before it was implemented, in practice it creates issues. For context, there is a roughly 20 minute trip I often make between two nice neighborhoods around three o’clock and at seven o’clock. I have a 4.96 rating, and I always tip the max. I used to get drivers who were close by and it rarely passed over a driver in my area. Now, there may be a driver 5 minutes away from me at all times, but the trip is usually declined by at least 2-3 drivers, presumably because they don’t want to stray from within a very small area. This means that though there may be three cars within 10 minutes from me, I often wait 15 minutes or more.

I think it’s unfair for drivers to not be able to see the trip destination. However, ultimately, the customer here is the rider. If drivers are using this change not just to avoid dangerous areas and gratuitously long trips, but to be super picky and selective on which short trips in nice areas they want, then I can’t recommend the app in its current state.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-13T12:56:09-07:00

The pickup time you see BEFORE deciding to request the ride is never accurate. They lure you in with shorter estimates that increase dramatically AFTER you’ve already requested the ride. Then, if you want to cancel it there’s a fee. Or god forbid you make them wait an extra second, they’ll leave or charge you for that too. 
The “walk a few blocks to save money” feature should NOT be automatically applied, making users manually deselect it. I’ve forgotten to do so several times and had to walk in the rain because of it. To my knowledge, I don’t even think it shows you where you will be dropped off ahead of time, just where you have to walk to be picked up. The price you see also should NOT reflect this feature automatically. It’s very deceiving. 
I’ve also had a driver refuse to pick me up and literally text me saying he drove off because he only picks up customers that are “educated”. I contacted customer support and screenshot the text, along with the driver’s information, and was merely offered $5 off my next ride.

He simply submitted a picture of a wet blanket on top of his car seat to Uber and reported me for things I didn’t even do. Trying to get a hold of their customer service department took over a day due to high volume on the chat feature on their app. They quickly sided with the driver and it took some time to finally get the charge removed. However, now my rating is affected by this fraudulent driver who keeps banging his customers for cleaning fees and other false charges/incidents.

I would recommend adding a 1-800 number for starters and suggest that Uber has penalties for its drivers who try to jack up their fees for no reason and lies about incidents. Again I have been a loyal customer for 3 years, with a 5 star rating and got no incentives from them to keep using their services. Instead I get an $80 cleaning fee as a thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-12T16:34:57-07:00

Especially when it comes to payment and safety. Numerous times I have been picked up off the side of a busy street. Not at a light or a stop sign or a pull off road. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. I have tried contacting Uber multiple times through email but they kept saying adjust your pin. Which I do and it keeps telling drivers to pick me up in the middle of a busy street. This is dangerous .
Also multiple times payment has been double charged and can’t contact an Uber to fix this issue to make sure it will be resolved. Multiple times Uber drivers refuse my ride cause I have a service dog and so I get charged a cancellation fee which is paid with my credit card. But Uber wants to give me a credit. But lately no credit is showing up!!! Please give us a real person to talk to and not shove us to the side with a stupid email. This is annoying especially when I pay up to 40$ per trip. Like that’s a lot of money for someone to pay and you can’t treat your customers right. !!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-10T11:30:21-07:00

So after 3 attempts, I went over to Lyft, tried a couple times and same thing, no rides. Not a big deal, got a taxi instead and went home. Come later that night I open my bank app only to find Uber took $322 out of it for my attempted rides, even though they were never done and it doesn’t show them on my app!! I contacted them about this issue, only to be forwarded a email “we are sorry for this inconvenience, your money will be returned to your account in 3-5 days” so because of Uber’s mistake I have to now wait multiple days to get over $300 back that they took (put a hold on) they then proceeded to try blaming this on my bank, stating that this is a very common thing done between all drive share apps. Meanwhile Lyft never took any money from me for my attempted rides, and after speaking to them. If the ride does not pair with a driver, they do not take the money. So I am out $320 for about 4 days, Uber services was no help in getting it back faster, and they lied about this being something all companies do.. will not be using them ever again.

After I phoned to explain that I had luggage and a broken foot he insisted again I go to the Donut Shop if I wanted him to drive me. When I explained again that I had no idea where Duncan Donuts was located and reiterated my circumstances he began to yell at me and tell me that I was to far away and it would inconvenience him to drive to the other side of the station. When I questioned why he hung up and cancelled my trip. 

The great news is after 15 min of waiting for the driver who cancelled my trip and another 6 minutes for another Uber I had the “Best” Driver and most fascinating conversation. Not only did the Driver get out of his car to pick up my luggage, when we arrived at my destination, he took my 2 suitcases up 2 flights of stairs. His gracious, kind, compassionate behavior was exemplified by his actions...and so it goes from a nightmarish experience to one filled with Joy.

I always treat people who work in service jobs well because I am acutely aware that they are often treated and paid unfairly. I had a nice ride with the driver, asked him about his holidays, etc. It was a 10 minute drive for $15 dollars and I tipped him $5. I also gave him 5 stars on the spot. (He said he was going to give me a good rating; I guess they rate their riders?) Well, this evening, I opened my email to a message that I damaged his car. Pictures were included of cigarette burns. Well, I do. Not. Smoke. EVER! Being anywhere near cigarettes triggers migraine headaches for me. And I certainly didn’t cause that. The car smelled like it had been smoked in every day of its life, to the point that it was giving me a headache. I suspect that he wants Uber to recompense him for his already-burned car. I am furious, to say the least. I tried to call Uber, but it’s funny how they are unavailable. It’s an unfair mark on my name  and goodwill, and I can do nothing to fix it. I can’t even amend my review of this slimebag. All I know is that his name is Abilio and he is driving in the Danielson-Killingly-Putnam-Pomfret area of northeast CT. I deeply regret spending my hard earned money and humanity on this company.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-24T17:11:33-07:00
1965781763,ErikJaffe,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id27122826,3.273.10000,1,Worse and worse over time update,"From the truly appalling GPS directions that send drivers on foolish paths, to the latest innovation of giving the trip to a driver that still has not finished another trip, the designers of this app have done a disservice to the brilliance of the original idea. Now when you look at the app and see ten cars just minutes away, don’t believe the lie. Once you request the car, the app does not give you one of those many available cars, but instead someone who is much farther away and not finished with a current fare. Never used to be like this. No longer trust the App. Did they lose all the good designers?  Or is customer experience simply no longer a priority?  Definitely will start looking at Lyft to see if they can do better.  Don’t know if they can, but Uber has lost any loyalty it built over the years.

Update:  once again Uber shows disdain for customers, assigning trips to drivers who are far away and not done with a previous trip. Driver then cancels forcing rider to start over with another driver far away. Can’t fathom why Uber isn’t losing customers and market value hand over fist. Awaiting next decline in quality, hopefully it will kill inspire competent competing services.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2017-12-02T14:42:32-07:00
3594586103,usetoloveuber,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id647876449,3.329.10002,5,Pick up and drop off,"On several occasions the driver’s GPS states a different address other than the one I entered. This results in the cost of my ride to increase when the driver had to wait for me to walk to where he is. At $0.39 per minute the cost of my ride was increased by over $2.00 with UberX. I’m frustrated, the driver is frustrated; he shows me the address his GPS recorded, I show him the address entered and recorded on my phone. To add an additional stop or address also creates a problem. In one instance, I entered one change... the driver’s GPS added an additional one. I had to show the driver the entries recorded on my phone. This is very disturbing and could be considered fraud on Uber’s part. Please fix this problem.
Uber walk is the worst idea Uber has so far... to be dropped off in the middle of no where, nor knowing if one should go right or left to get to one’s destination at night, in a strange neighborhood is asking for a disaster to occur. In my opinion, Uber walk should not be the first option offered.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-30T23:28:47-07:00
3051591846,raven 19,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id115077017,3.311.10001,3,Ok for Drop-offs not Pickups,"The general idea behind the app is that it’s a car- hailing app. Based off of my experience it is good if not great in this area, I’m always able to request rides and the drivers are very easy to talk with and are great at driving you to your locations, never had a missed destination. However the app is totally internet dependent, meaning that if your not connected to wi-fi the app won’t work for you.  This is very short- sighted, I believe, because things happen there should be ways available to contact Uber, cancel rides or modify trips other than through the app itself.  Hence my title, sometimes I request pickups but things come up and I am not able to contact the drivers or cancel my trip( not every location has wi-fi).   Secondly, the app has added protective features such as call 911 and share my ride with family along with app changes like rider ratings but these are more so-so  features that really don’t change anything; if I have no access to wi-fi I can’t use the protective features and the whole idea of rider ratings could be insulting to some people, Trips aren’t free.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-08-11T16:20:11-07:00

But when it was pickup time until half an hour later, I saw nothing. I had wait for half an hour. At first I thought it was problems with my phone, so I called the driver and checked if he was near my place. I called him 2 times and 2 times he answered me that he was on his way, and that had 2 other riders he had to pick up and drop off before he could get to my place. I told him to tell me exactly where he was, it turned out that he was amazingly far away from my place. 
I had to cancel the ride and booked another ride, this time I waited for another 10 minutes but nothing had happened. 
Finally I had to cancel it again and booked my ride for the third time, this time it worked and I got home after an hour of waiting. 
What's the point of schedule ahead of time when you guys make me wait for an hour to get home while I had scheduled it in advance? After making me wait for an hour, you guys just sent me $10 Uber Credits after I myself canceled the ride? I mean it's not about money, it's about your service.
