If you didn‚Äôt recieve something then it was most likely the restraunts fault. Don‚Äôt blame the drivers. Also you sound like a darn whiner and complainer. Go touch some grass or make some tea. Maybe smoke a joint. I don‚Äôt know but hey who knows if you change your thought process and attitude good things may come your way‚Ä¶. Like getting your food from the restraunts you ask to be delivered with these UBER apps. I don‚Äôt know, maybe!
