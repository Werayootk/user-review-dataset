It doesn’t let you delete places from your list bc it’s constantly freezing which is annoying!!!!  I have to keep going back into the app to unfreeze it. The ones I thought were deleted are still in there. Still going to use it and continue to use the Apple bc I dislike Apple Maps but just wish the glitches would get worked out.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-02-08T18:56:57-07:00"},{"id":"4895462439","userName":"trebory6","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id87652704","version":"5.27","score":1,"title":"If traffic was as unpredictable as they say, then why does the ETA always go up and never down?","text":"Cause if you ever noticed your ETA climbing, ask yourself why that is. It’s because Google maps no longer actually routes you the fastest direction anymore.\n\nI don’t know what they changed in their algorithm, but since they changed it there has been a noticeable uptick in Los Angeles traffic. Everyone I know who uses Google maps has said that it it took a nose dive recently.\n\nIn the stupid thing is, whenever you bring this up with support, they always say that traffic is unpredictable and they do the best they can.\n\nThe only problem with this, is that if the traffic was truly unpredictable, then why does the ETA always go up, and never down?\n\nIt’s because their algorithms VASTLY underestimate traffic. Their algorithms are what is off here. I’ve been using google maps for years and it’s only been in the past several months it’s turned into probably the most frustrating thing I’ve ever had to deal with.\n\nI don’t even want an ETA anymore. It’s useless. Why have an eta if you’re always just going to show up 10 minutes late to everything anyways? \n\nAt what point will the “Traffic is heavier than usual” traffic become normal since it says that every SINGLE time I go anywhere. \n\nI don’t know what their issue is around Los Angeles but there are tons of reddit posts that are full of people asking why Google Maps has recently crapped their bed.\n\nWaze isn’t much different.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-10-05T19:12:50-07:00"},{"id":"8866782902","userName":"Candie386","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id28928524","version":"6.26","score":5,"title":"THAN YOU NEAL AND TEAM !!","text":"THANK YOU NEAL!!!! I cannot thank Neal and his team enough !! They made the selling process super smooth and easy explaining things every step of the way . I could not ask for a better broker and his whole team was truly wonderful . Neal was very informative and and has a very intuitive sense about the market . I listened to his recommendations  and sold my home super fast and for a great price . From Neal to Lindsay and even the escrow team was very responsive to any of my questions and ensured the process went smoothly and quickly.  I hope the new buyer is enjoying the new home as much as I did …and if I ever need to buy or sell a home again I would definitely call Neal and  his team as they are truly AMAZING !!!!! If I could give them 10 stars I would :)) !!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-07-12T09:22:39-07:00"},{"id":"5488593835","userName":"okayjoe","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id107556442","version":"5.35","score":2,"title":"Please stop asking for approval!","text":"I use Google Maps for work, using it to get to my patient’s houses to do home care. Normally I’m very happy with the app, but suddenly it’s asking me to rate how happy I am with the app at the exact moment I’m arriving... if the address is down the street, fine - I have a chance to memorize the house number before google wants to be rated, but often, the address I’m looking for is immediately on the last turn, so google asks for a rating before it’s even given me the address, leaving me absolutely stuck! I have to pull over so I can go back and look at the exact address I’m looking for. I’m sorry, but rating google at that moment is not my primary interest, but finding the address is! If I rate it at that moment, I’ll give a zero out of sheer frustration! Do I need to use a different app for navigation all the way to my final destination??? Please tell me how to opt out of rating - I want to rate at my own convenience and choice, not google’s!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=585027354&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-02-04T15:13:19-07:00"}]
