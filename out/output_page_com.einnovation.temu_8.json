Plus if you have $2 points left the wheel will always land on $1. Making you have to play on. Which usually can‚Äôt because not enough points to spin again. Usually expired by that time. Also you are limited to daily invites or gift picking. I know ppl claim they have won , but until I experience it myself I have my doubts. Better luck just buying the items you want.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-08-28T15:14:17-07:00"},{"id":"9934801359","userName":"bowins steph","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1029563463","version":"1.70.0","score":5,"title":"I‚Äôm really liking Temu","text":"Loving everything I have gotten so far with this company.

Imagine stepping into a digital carnival, where every clown is a pop-up ad, and the prizes are just more ads. This app is the digital equivalent of a pushy salesperson who not only follows you around but also jumps in front of you at every turn with a new \"amazing\" deal. \n\nThe moment you open the app, you're greeted not with products, but with a bombardment of pop-up games that seem ripped straight from a low-budget 'Price is Right'. It's like playing whack-a-mole, except every mole is screaming \"Buy me!\" and \"Crazy discount here!\" It's so relentless that I half-expected Drew Carey to pop out and ask me to spin the wheel.\n\nThen there's the product display. Oh, the horror! It's like they've tried to cram an entire mall into a phone booth. Information, pictures, and more flashing deals are squeezed into every pixel, creating a chaotic collage that even Picasso would find baffling. Navigating through the app is like trying to read a novel through a keyhole ‚Äì it's possible, but why would you put yourself through that?\n\nIn summary, if you enjoy a shopping experience that feels like being chased by a swarm of bees while trying to read fine print, then this is the app for you. Otherwise, do what I did: delete it and enjoy the peaceful, ad-free serenity of literally any other shopping app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1641486558&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2024-01-07T04:49:41-07:00"}]
