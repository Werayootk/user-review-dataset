I especially believe the new card-style home screen that is being pushed so aggressively is not only inefficient, but also unpleasant to look at, and the community did not say they wanted this.

I’ll explain it to from Wikipedia. It says”Shuffle play is a mode of music playback in which songs are played in a randomized order that is decided upon for all tracks at once. It is commonly found on CD players, digital audio players and media player software. Shuffle playback prevents repeated tracks, which makes it distinct from random playback, in which the next track is chosen at random after the last track has ended.” Ok?

Jakes,"I recently had the pleasure of immersing myself in the transformative podcast experience, ""Sleep Psalms"" by Bishop T.D. Jakes. This podcast, a masterful blend of soothing narration and spiritual insights, has become an essential part of my nightly routine.

Bishop Jakes' calming voice serves as a gentle guide, leading listeners through a tapestry of Psalms that not only promote restful sleep but also instill a sense of peace and connection with the divine. The choice of Psalms is thoughtful, each one carefully selected to resonate with the tranquility of the night.

What sets ""Sleep Psalms"" apart is its ability to seamlessly intertwine biblical wisdom with the universal need for peaceful sleep. Bishop Jakes' reflections offer a sense of comfort and reassurance, making it more than just a podcast but a spiritual companion in the quiet moments before slumber.

The production quality is impeccable, with a serene musical backdrop that enhances the overall ambiance. Whether you seek solace, inspiration, or simply desire a restful night's sleep, ""Sleep Psalms"" delivers on all fronts. Bishop T.D. Jakes has crafted a podcast that not only speaks to the soul but also cradles it in a cocoon of serenity. Highly recommended for those seeking a blend of spiritual nourishment and peaceful repose.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-13T08:07:42-07:00

A lot of times it doesn't even load and it's only a black screen, doesn't even say there's an error or no connection. I have to restart the app for it to work. It's been happening for the past 3 months probably.

-Between my account on my iPhone, and my account on my MacBook, they don't reflect the same recently listened to music or podcasts. It's like the MacBook only has history for music that I've listened to directly on the MacBook.

The Apple watch app is often unresponsive and needs a lot of improvement. The current podcast/song playing screen often doesn't match up with what my iPhone is playing and is very laggy. Most of the time, the buttons don't work when I push them. Or I have to push them multiple times. Or they don't respond at all. Another problem is that using the crown to change the volume by often lags and it takes several seconds for the noise level to update. Or sometimes I'll use the crown, it changes the volume but in seconds it reverts back to its previous volume.

Why when I go to MY library of artists, do I not see the artists I’ve downloaded albums from? Instead I see useless suggestions, of artists that I’ve played like once before, but the ones I listen to constantly are buried? I don’t want to spend the time configuring the app, by “choose artists” I just want to find who I want to listen to and play their music. 

Why can’t I just see an ALPHABETICAL list of artists? About 90 of the time I listen to stuff, I just have to search for from home, even though it’s in my library buried somewhere. 

Why when I click albums do I see a list of albums, but that’s where you’ve decided to organize the artists alphabetically, leaving the album names themselves look like you’ve ordered the album names by random. 

Why is it that in every album I play, you default it to shuffle, and I have to manually turn it back off, EACH TIME I play the same album. It’s super frustrating. Why can I not just set a global setting of shuffle play = no,  and repeat = no, and have the app remember my preference?

I’ve been a paying customer for quite sometime and the app has to be great. It’s been a steady decline for the last year, and I’ve finally had it and writing this review. 

Come on. I do this crap for a living and it blows my mind that your UI/UX team would let this awful of an app get released in this day and age.

Now I have to type in the band name under artists to access saved albums. Every time I tap said artist, it takes me to the artist page instead of the music I have saved from them. Super annoying when I’m driving. ALSO, the driving mode is garbage. I can’t swipe with my finger while driving which I could do without looking in standard mode. With drive mode you actually have to press the skip buttons as opposed to swiping. So I never use it. It’s useless in my opinion. Many other annoying things, but I value my time, so I’m not going over everything. Desktop version is so slow it’s nearly useless, with exception to editing playlists using the select all/delete all function that a desktop has to offer... but again, it is soooooo slow!!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-09-06T23:30:24-07:00

So it’s pretty clear that I love this app. But it has some problems, like how on all of my other devices, I can skip as many songs as I want, and when I want to listen to certain song, I can just click on it, but that’s not the case on my phone. I don’t know why they just have those privileges on  other devices, but not the phone. Like today, for example. I had been listening to an album and I could just pick a song and listen to it, and I had been doing it for about a week on my phone. But then today, when I went to go listen to the album from the top, it was on shuffle, and I had never put it on shuffle. It’s pretty annoying to have to go through this ONLY on my phone. You could improve this by making the automatic shuffle an on and off thing, other than just turning it on overnight, but that’s just my opinion",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-11T15:22:37-07:00

You have to click on edit the playlist and then search through the list to remove individual songs but it would be better if you could remove as you listen or swipe right to remove.

I find this ridiculous and I would not recommend giving a company that doesn’t listen to its subscribers more money. Apple music is a much better option and the issues I mentioned above are all taken care of on that app. Not to mention, if you don’t have premium, the user experience will be even worse and they will flood you with loads of ads that promote their premium subscription and nothing else.

I liked being able to see in my playlist the suggested songs (maybe all at the end instead of scattered around if you did bring it back) and now it’s really difficult to add suggested songs to the playlist that are already done playing. 

I am begging you listen to me and bring back enhance instead. Or at least make smart shuffle 1000x better than it is, because it stinks. Other than that, excellent app and great service. Really love how easy it is to discover new artists (I won’t say anything else about enhance but… enhance made that so easy).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=324684580&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-29T15:19:06-07:00
