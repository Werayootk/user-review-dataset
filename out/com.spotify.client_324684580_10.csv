One more thing, a premium subscription is worth its weight in gold. You can listen with Spotify for free which can‚Äôt be said for most of the other top apps, but they throw in ads every four or five songs, you can‚Äôt cherry pick songs/ you have to listen on shuffle and it shuffles in other songs that you may or may not like.
