This feature is not that match with the archiving ability (which is used much as a hiding feature not a archive feature)\n3: I think it would be very helpful if you let people to post messages and send files (pics, videos, and etc.) with knowing that nobody could forward those (taking screenshots are inescapable.\n4: Let people archive their chats in a file as they can access them later if anything happened to their telegram account.
