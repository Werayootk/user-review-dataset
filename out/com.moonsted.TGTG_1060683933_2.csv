In my local neighborhood there is only 1 store that participates, and I don‚Äôt go out 8:30 at night to take a bus for pizza. However, when I‚Äôm in Manhattan, there are countless options at all hours of the day and night. I highly recommend this app, because it allows you to check out new places at a greatly reduced cost. The app will tell you how much the ‚Äúsurprise bag‚Äù costs and the approximate value of its contents. For example, yesterday I paid $6 for a bag with an approximate value of $16, but the actual value was $19.75. Up front cost‚Äôs vary from place to place, and it‚Äôs not just restaurants and bakeries.

I happened to be in the neighborhood of Castro Valley &
Wondered if Peet‚Äôs had some food that needed to be rescued.  
 
They had 2 left to be rescued I got one.  They 4 items were carefully placed in pastry bags individually & that was a bonus!  The previous times @ a few other locations just lump the 4 pastries directly into the bag with no wax paper on the bottom or placed in pastry bags.

What was in my mystery bag?
 2 Pumpkin Bread slices (tasted like a ginger cinnamon bread), a Blueberry Crumb Muffin & a Maple Walnut Scone.  Tender & delicious

The deduction of stars, or a star rating of 1 star seemed unfair to the employees who work there.  This company, like many companies these days, provides no contact email for when you need to submit a flaw with the workflow, or when you want to submit an issue.  They do tell users inside their app ‚ÄúThese are the things you are permitted to speak to us about.‚Äù It‚Äôs the Amazon High Tower effect looking down on the peasants as their money is taken. 

Here‚Äôs what you should know if you choose to participate: 

A.) Not all the food is waste food. Some businesses are actually making more food in order to offer these TooGoodToGo bags. Is that being monitored by the company? Probably not.

B.) There is no way for the person who purchases a bag to be able to say ‚Äú1/2 of the bag went into my trash.‚Äù 

C.) Honest user reviews are not displayed to other users. Only a limited number of happy term is presented to a purchaser and then happy terms are tallied for the business and presented to others.  You only see Happy Reviews for all businesses. 

D.) Once a review is submitted you cannot added, modify, or create an additional review of the business. So if produce spoiled before normal, or you got sick a day later then you cannot change or addend your review. 

What started out as a great idea and concept has been taken over by business greed of others.

Statistically speaking, by not capturing waste values from customers, it is probably an insignificant amount for the overall numbers in the world, where the truth is not being believed anymore it is imperative, that we all tell the truth. No matter if it‚Äôs 100 more or 100 less in 1 billion it‚Äôs not our job to decide this is the truth will tell them.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-27T10:14:30-07:00

The one restaurant that is available in my area has been really hit or miss. Sometimes everything is great, sometimes not. It honestly comes down to if employees are familiar with the app. A couple of times the workers didn‚Äôt know what the app/code meant and needed to call a manager before making the order (which I thought was really odd). They also didn‚Äôt know what to put in it, so it wasn‚Äôt very plentiful, even for the discounted price. Other times it is a great mix of food and it‚Äôs ready to go in their check out stand!

10961769965,Girlypopteengirl247,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1061121220,24.2.1,5,Food for a fraction of the full price,You have to continue to monitor the app for possible deals in the area. Worth the money to try new food and explore all restaurants in the area. It puta the restaurant on the map and if it‚Äôs good will have a returning customer. Down side is not being able to pick from the menu but it gives the customer a feeling of the establishment.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-20T17:33:57-07:00
