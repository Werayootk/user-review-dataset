And for some ridiculous reason, my company is extremely paranoid about gmail and has it completely blocked. Thus, I cannot log into my personal email through my work computer. I can only use my phone. But can I quickly select multiple/all emails in my junk folders to delete them at once through the app? No, I cannot. I have to select each one individually, which takes roughly a million years. Because I, like I‚Äôm sure a lot of people who have been using the same email since they were a teenager, have thousands upon thousands of junk emails sent to me every hour. So, to quickly and efficiently clean and organize my inbox, I must log into my email on my desktop at home in the evenings while my toddler is screaming at me. But do I do that? Of course not. Who thinks of cleaning their over-cluttered email inbox with their very limited evening free time. So of course, my millions of emails stack in my inbox for months until I can‚Äôt take it and eventually attempt to clean it all out, which takes hours, and I inevitably give up, and thus the cycle repeats.\n\nFor the love of God, Google.

Recently, my Inboxes have been getting emails that are clearly Spam emails! Why is this happening? I would like to be able to select these emails, without opening them, and put them into the Spam folder. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt select any of those emails! Currently, I have to do that from my computer instead of from my iPhone! That‚Äôs a major inconvenience! #3. Since the launch of iPhone 11.0 update, my phone alerts me that I have a new email, but it turns out that I really don‚Äôt. I end up wasting time logging on to my phone only to find out that the sound notification was erroneous. #4. As others have mentioned, the red notification flag isn‚Äôt always responsive when all new emails has been read.\n\nFixing these issues would make my use of Gmail much more effective and enjoyable!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-11-04T14:22:35-07:00"},{"id":"9734457241","userName":"thisisnotfunorsafe","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id926329592","version":"6.0.230219","score":1,"title":"Super intrusive","text":"I am in the process of abandoning and closing all my google accounts and going to an email that is not intrusive.

I would like the space on my cell phone to be freed up from those unnecessary emails.  Any advice?  I have not taken the time to set up a new email account someplace else.

It groups Promotions and other tabs, but with Gmail, swiping simply hides the group until next time. I still have to swipe each individual email to delete. With Inbox, I could delete or archive the entire group with 1 swipe. Inbox also let me pin emails to the inbox, rather than just starring them. I also want to see the Gmail app have swipe options. Currently, it is either archive or delete no matter if you swipe to the left of right. I want both where I can choose the function for each swipe direction. Outlook also has this feature.

I have 30 different people in that label and I cannot keep track of them all unless they have that label which was the main reason I switch to gmail for my business. I figured it was fine and I would just use gmail on Chrome since there is NO APP for Contacts on the iPad.
