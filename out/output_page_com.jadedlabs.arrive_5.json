It used to be crazy accurate, and I was really impressed, but now I almost don‚Äôt trust it, because I get different information when I go straight to USPS‚Äô or UPS‚Äô website with my tracking numbers. I just got a notification that a package of mine is still on track to arrive in two days... I received that package a week ago. And it‚Äôs tracking number reflects that, so I‚Äôm not sure why Arrive wouldn‚Äôt. \n\nUsed to be an A+ app, but I‚Äôm really disappointed now.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-06-16T03:23:35-07:00"},{"id":"10718738927","userName":"D.Black boy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id107456589","version":"2.137.0","score":1,"title":"Needs Improvement","text":"I thought Shop was trustworthy as they are connected with another company I use. When they gave me shop cash to use, I thought I‚Äôd give them a try.  I found a product I wanted and ordered. Nowhere did it say the item was shipping from China. The estimated time for delivery it gave me was within 2 weeks (ordered Nov 30.) When the order shipped a few days later it updated to show it won‚Äôt arrive until Dec 17-21. Now (Dec 19) it‚Äôs showing it failed to clear customs. All of this happens with online shopping, but other platforms have the option to review the shop. If Shop is going to have companies on its platform, it needs to have a way of vetting them, and reviewing them, and reporting if there are issues. I did reach out to the company I ordered from the day I ordered two different ways and have yet to receive a reply. This interaction has left me with a sour taste, I will not be trusting Shop for recommendations.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1223471316&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-19T10:08:01-07:00"},{"id":"4998863386","userName":"tinukz","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id734252762","version":"1.4.3","score":5,"title":"Great but this refreshing bug is a pain","text":"I love Arrive. It‚Äôs so convenient and I adore that it pulls the tracking information from my emails without me having to manually input them. Recently however, there‚Äôs a bug that keeps delivered packages on the home screen (even when I have archived them) and they keep showing the loading circle. Those windows are also greyed out so I can‚Äôt try to delete or remove them. They just remain on my main window with the loading action in permanent rotation. I have tried deleting and adding back the app. I have forced quit the app, signed out and signed back in and nothing works. Those greyed out past deliveries just remain on my window and there is absolutely no action I can take to remove them.

It will have shops in there that are erroneous or you have no desire to follow.  The app fails to allow you to do anything with the list which negates it‚Äôs value.  If you purchase one off item from multiple vendors they are all on the list and the important ones you care about go neglected due to the length of the list.
