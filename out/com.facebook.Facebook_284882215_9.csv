After this most recent phone upgrade, I did notice when other people post avatar stickers, I can click below it where it says ‚ÄúCreate Your Avatar‚Äù, but when I do so it says I don‚Äôt have the right version of the Facebook app to support the feature, and going to the App Store does nothing because it‚Äôs the latest version of the software. I have also deleted and redownloaded the app several times. Even going to the website through Safari on my phone and on a laptop I still can‚Äôt access it anywhere. I have reported the issue multiple times and never received a response from Facebook about it, I‚Äôm just completely confused as to why I am not able to create an Avatar whatsoever.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2021-01-22T20:29:58-07:00
3016331707,Gypsypriest,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id3184877,183.0,4,It just keeps getting worse,"Every time the developers fiddle with this app, some useful functionality disappears. Months ago, it was the link between the birthday notifications and the timeline of the honoree. I keep expecting this to be fixed, but clicking on the link that supposedly takes you to the page where you can convey good wishes still results in a broken link notice. What‚Äôll the point of telling you someone has a birthday if you have to go through all manner of gyrations to wish them a happy one? In native FB, this problem doesn‚Äôt occur, so it‚Äôs definitely in this app.

Now, I find that the little blue dot that indicates an unread notification no longer disappears when you click on the link to the notice, so that you quickly lose your place. Again, native FB doesn‚Äôt create this problem.

So, what‚Äôll the point of using this app at all? Why not just go in through your web browser?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2018-08-04T06:03:27-07:00

However, I do know that people can easily get hacked and never get there accounts back. I also know from my experience what I‚Äôm frustrated about. For a long time I would open my notifications on Facebook, and it would always asks for my location or to know my contacts. Personally, this is not something I feel I need to share with Facebook. To me it‚Äôs not necessary for the app to function with my information so I see no point in sharing that. To get to my point, it‚Äôd be a lot nicer if Facebook didn‚Äôt ask for my personal information when I‚Äôve clearly skewed I‚Äôm not going to give it. I do mostly love the app, but I wish it would stop being so annoying with its persistence to get information from a minor. I hope this helps!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-18T17:27:34-07:00

Every time the app updates it might ""fix"" one thing but breaks another.  I am tired of there ""fixes"" apparently there is not testing department there anymore they use the public to test.  The marketplace searching now stopped working with the latest update.  Does not matter what I search for nothing shows up no matter how far out I look.  I can see the items and search for the title of the items I see still nothing.  The recent posts I want to see what happened with my friends since the last time I was on and that is a total joke.  It worked perfect then they ""fixed"" that also maybe so they could put more adds on my wall or something but either way all it is doing is driving there users away in droves.  I have started to follow my family and friends on other apps because so many of them have chosen other paths for there social media.  Facebook you had the keys to the kingdom but just as my space is gone so shall you if you don't start to listen to your reviews and users!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2017-11-22T11:23:52-07:00

Is Facebook doctors? Yet they censored posts about covid and Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop. If I believe Hamas are animals for raping and killing people, who is Facebook to filter my posts to my own family?  Also every time I open my Facebook, every single day I see Taylor swift, Madonna, Michael Jackson or the karashians. I would rather slide down a razor blade than listen or see any of these people. Facebooks services have only gotten worse over the years. In terms of a business page, we have to pay Facebook so that our own followers can see our serves we offer.  More than half of our followers never see anything we post. Why even have followers if we have to pay for them to see our business?  Zuckerberg pays millions to interfere in the 2020 election and then goes and builds himself a bunker in Hawaii to hide like a coward when our nation is destroyed by Biden‚Äôs rotten government.

I stopped creating on here for a while because of the features other platforms gave me to grow & do what I love. It seemed to becoming the thing of the past, but I‚Äôm really impressed by the changes & updates that they are giving us. Facebook has always felt like home to me. I tried to stick with them for a long time, until it was hurting my hard work $ dedication I put into my content. Now that they are upping their game & offering more to their creators experience & personal experience, I‚Äôm back! Thank you for caring enough to give us who always stood by you no matter goes much it hurt us, more opportunities that those of us who really work hard for you & ourselves. Also, for making personal use of Facebook more enjoyable.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=284882215&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-16T05:58:27-07:00
