As a platform, Airbnb has exceeded my expectations in every way, making it an absolute pleasure to be a part of their vibrant community.

First and foremost, Airbnb's user-friendly interface and intuitive design made the entire hosting process a breeze. From setting up my listing to managing reservations, everything was seamlessly organized, allowing me to focus on providing an exceptional experience for my guests.

The level of support and guidance offered by Airbnb truly sets them apart. Their comprehensive resources, including hosting tips, best practices, and a dedicated customer support team, ensured that I was well-prepared and equipped to deliver a top-notch hosting service. Whenever I had questions or needed assistance, their responsive support team was just a message away, ready to assist me promptly.

The visibility and exposure that Airbnb provides are unparalleled. The platform's wide reach and extensive marketing efforts attracted a diverse range of guests from all around the world. I had the pleasure of hosting individuals from different cultures and backgrounds, enriching my hosting experience and broadening my horizons.

Lastly, Airbnb's payment system is convenient and reliable. The seamless integration of financial transactions ensured that I received prompt and secure payments for my hosting services. It eliminated any concerns about handling cash or managing complex payment processes, allowing me to focus on creating an exceptional stay for my guests.

In conclusion, Airbnb has been an absolute game-changer for me as a host. Their exceptional platform, outstanding support, commitment to safety, and global reach have elevated my hosting experience to new heights. If you're considering becoming a host, I wholeheartedly recommend Airbnb as the ultimate platform to showcase your space and create unforgettable memories for your guests.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-29T21:50:29-07:00

11083018905,Ren.Park,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id119872047,24.12,3,Way too many test listings,"There’s been a major surge of test listings bulking up the search space, congesting the list with repetitive and often joke-implied fake listings for “testing purposes” — Why does one host need multiple test listings of very similar unit tests? (some hosts doing this will just straight up add “funny” pictures of drawings and immature headlines for the listings. It’s obvious they’re not using this feature to practice advertising and even more obvious that Airbnb is not vetting these listings at all. It takes up a lot of the featured showings and makes the search very exhausting to sort past. The experience really hindered the app’s quality and function for me. 

Another thing I found is the hosts’ tendencies to write external fees within the listings, without applying them to the calculated amounts in the system. They have been charging Airbnb guests outside of the app and I’m pretty sure that’s in violation of the company’s policies.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-24T23:59:54-07:00

The app is the best version they’ve ever released! I can do pretty much everything for my cell phone. It’s intuitive and lacks the clutter that every other booking app has her hosts.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-23T14:11:08-07:00

11065931022,AllyBanz44444,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id531827992,24.11,3,Unfair,"I had decent experience with airbnb. My issue comes in with the “review” system. I don’t feel it is fair that the app urges us to give the host a good review or it won’t be posted, but the host can write a bad review about the customer and it gets posted with no issues. Plus we have to “dispute” a negative review through support which takes forever if it even happens. It’s very dishonest and unfair to current and future users. All reviews about the host should be posted, good or bad because all reviews get posted about the customer no matter if it’s good or bad. I will not use the app anymore because of this. I deleted my account.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-20T10:02:24-07:00
