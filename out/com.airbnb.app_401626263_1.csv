There’s a few things I really want that are not on the app and one is the ability to manually check a guest out of your unit so it allows you to leave a review and change automatically into new daily guests. Otherwise having to wait until 12-3 pm to leave a review after I’ve completed all checkout/check in tasks for the next guest and then having to come back later is a little annoying. Also, if there’s a way to turn off notifications for “_____ is arriving in 12 days” that’d be great. Additionally, I’d love to be able to utilize IF functions for shortcode messages. For example, if I try and attach a shortcode message and include something like the guests home city (“safe travels from /guest_city/!”) but the guests profile doesn’t have that information to pull, it shows as “/guest_city/“ in the message to the guest and I would like to be able to attach an if statement to drop part of the phrase if the info isn’t available (or warn me that it’s not filling it in bc it’s missing that data so I can fix it myself, otherwise I often miss it if I’m not diligent!).

Each was wonderful and had everything we needed including the loan of beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. We didn’t cook, but each unit was well appointed with everything we would need and next time we will enjoy creating our own meals at the units and eat out less. We enjoyed visiting briefly with each owner, they were all really nice but not intrusive at all. We went on two excursions recommended and booked through Airbnb. They were great and good value. I would recommend the Wild Dolphin & Snorkeling adventure with Captain Chase and the Local Brews & Poke Flights with Lottie and a wonderful chef and fun bartender at a beautiful golf course. They were both awesome and each was a small group of 5-6 people allowing us to ask our hosts questions and visit with the other guests. We will likely use Airbnb more often, it was super easy to book the units, more fun and less expensive than a hotel. When they say ‘Super Host’ believe it, book it and relax.

TheCheckin window feature alone is not sufficient to call to the host attention since we are mainly looking at the guest profile and their inquiry message to accept their booking. To place attention on Checkin window please improve the feature to call to action that the guest wants to come earlier than the expected and ask if we can allow it! Assuming we see take note of all the reservations details I’d a false assumption if the guest inquiry message is requesting something or more importance.

I am afraid to even book another experience because it’s a total waste of money as it’s not what it states in the description. In fact, something that was a real treat, their pillows were dog beds! Not to mention my mom had a huge problem calling airbnb for help… We had this booked for months however, she lost her phone and could not get the details. Airbnb had blocked me from my account for months and refused to let me back. They wouldn’t even let me into my account to see the details even though my mom clearly could not get ahold of something she paid for(an emergency). We spent 2 hours of our time (on a cruise ship) arguing with airbnb “help” and they barely even offered a solution.

I work in customer service, and I have never seen and will never try to emulate the kind of awful customer service I experienced with AirBnb. 

I won’t get into the details because I’ve told this story too many times, but in essence, my host lied and claimed that my friends and I broke her air conditioning system and thermostat so she could charge us for the already-broken system. She also promised to refund us if we left our trip early, and—although we did—she refused the refund and then tried to charge us for the the thermostat (and at twice the cost of the actual unit). I contacted AirBnb about this promptly, and not only did they take weeks to answer me back, but they never had the decency to call me back and get my side of things (they only emailed after I complained about not getting a call despite my host getting a call from them). They took months to get to a resolution and their resolution, though vague and unclear, was along the lines of “your host doesn’t have to refund you, and you can solve this on your own.” 

So, basically,  my host and I got into a predicament which AirBnb refused to solve. I believe that their only reason for not wanting to handle this in my favor is because this host rents out multiple locations through AirBnb, and so she is more of an asset to them than I am.

I recommend you do everything possible to avoid.

It does not provide any support thereafter. Users are basically forced into choosing another unit on their platform, for which Airbnb charges an exorbitant service fee — despite the screw up on their platform. It is obvious this is incentivizing significant predatory behavior on their platform, for which Airbnb takes no responsibility and is doing nothing to protect its users. Many hosts now list many units that are not actually available, agreeing to dates and taking money from user accounts. After entrapping users, at the last minute they cancel the unit and force users into subpar units. Airbnb does not penalize the host, and profits off of the entrapment of its users— charging a huge service fee despite these huge screwups.

I started using Airbnb years ago, and they have recently been outsourcing their support to other countries with heavy and often incomprehensible foreign accents.

Recent bad experience with deceitful host at my last airbnb rental was not resolved correctly by airbnb customer service. Customer service failed to obtain an answer for me to my question regarding the basis for a host's deceitful review. Of course this was after the host refused to provide this answer to me directly when I question his comment. I told customer service of this host's paranoia about possibly receiving a bad guest review from me, and as a result his preparing himself with a review that could be flipped to an all out attack through follow-up response. He not only responded to me with new absurd fabrications as if to threaten retaliation for my putting him in an impossible spot since he isn't capable of providing a valid basis for his comment, but no doubt hiked up the rhetoric to customer service when they tried to intervene to discover the would-be basis for his review's troublesome comment. This host is a potential threat to any future guest, and I would speculate customer service policies and lack of follow-through integrity represents a systemic risk to any and all Airbnb guests throughout their enterprise network.

When my family decided they won’t be able to stay given the conditions of the apartment, the person designated by the host, started yelling at them, harassing, and blocked the gate to prevent them from leaving. That person scared my elderly mother and my 2 yo niece. They were finally able to leave the premises; I cancelled the reservation, and…Airbnb charged me $1500 for this “experience”!

I get it that hosts need some assurance but this is overboard, not even airlines, hotels or other services collect this much info...sure, they ask for passports or IDs upon arrival for verification, do the required check in/inspection and return it.  Why AirBnB needs to collect so much personal info? Why can't the hosts verify guests upon arrival anymore instead of this new practice?

All the personal info AirBnB is collecting now is a risky bet on today days of security data breaches or commercialization of privacy info for marketing purposes. Despite the assurances the company provides, it does not mean they will not sell off our info or that it will not get stolen. In addition, I don't control my info anymore once is uploaded; for example, while creating my account, I uploaded the ID and the required picture but I don't even see them anymore, I have no access to even make changes/updates of I prefer to. Or even to remove it. I don't own it anymore. 
Yes, is my choice not to use this AirBnB service so I will no longer use them. Hopefully I'm not the only one having this genuine concern.

I put in a City and great, there's like 800 places to pick from. Problem is that most of these locations are 30 minutes away from where I actually want to be. As a traveler, this is mostly inconvenient. So then you have to waste your time checking through each posting to see which one is actually close to where you want to be. Please add a distance filter from the city center to fix this mess. Other room finding applications know how to manage distance, so airbnb is way behind.

Aside from that, either the posting is falsified by the host or the engine is misreading metadata, but some city locations at the top, don't match what is on the map. I feel like this must be the host lying about the location to try and get people to go to their location, but airbnb should just pull the city location from the map. If it does already, then it's broken.

Covid was spiking, so I found it extremely uncomfortable to know how crammed the area was. The location of the house with an unsafe environment. All in all, it was safest and appropriate to leave. I believe the host was aware of the dishonesty, not allowing for refunds. 

The worst part about my Airbnb experience was the customer service. It took me hours to finally reach somebody, and when I did, I was transferred back-and-forth between employees until somebody said that they would be able to help me with a refund. This employee said I would have to wait for a call from the refund department. I waited a couple days before reaching out to the employee about not receiving a call. The employee said to be patient, and that it may take some time because of Covid. The chat was disconnected and I never received a call. I’m completely dissatisfied with the service I had with Airbnb. Unless something is resolved, I am confident to say that I will never recommend this service to anybody.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-21T13:26:21-07:00

I have been a host on Airbnb for about a year now and it’s been increasingly stressful by the day. Anytime anything happens on the customer side, no matter how small (like dust on top of the kitchen cabinets, I’ve literally had someone complain about that and get a refund) they penalize you $50 and cancel your payout. On the other hand I just had a guest completely lose his mind, threaten me, and try to leave with my appliances. I ended up having to call the cops and he was arrested (he actually had 3 WARRANTS and a heroin needle on him) when I called customer service to cancel his reservation the line recognized my number, saw I was a host, and hung up on me no matter what choice I made on the automated system. I still haven’t been able to talk to a live person and I’ve called all the numbers. Now I can’t give this psycho his refund and he’s been harassing over the app saying he’s going to leave a bad review sue me and complain to get a full refund, which he’ll probably get. I’m looking into other apps like Vrbo or hometogo but before I do I had to leave this review, I’ve never seen terrible service like this in my entire life, it’s literally non existent.

My fiancé’s bday was the other day and he had to travel to Miami for a work trip so we made a family weekend out of it. The hotel we were staying at was over booked so we decided to try to use Air B and B to find something cheaper that was still local. Downloaded the app, set up a profile and picked a place. Confirmed it and were excited out our new reservation. Not even 15 minutes later we get a message saying our reservation was canceled. Called the hotel and they said the never received the payment so we need to contact air B and B. I contacted them and the lady “couldn’t give me any info” so we waited for a “case manager” to call back. A couple hours later a women who spoke extremely broken English called and said they were sorry they have to cancel the reservation but we broke the terms and agreements.... which I don’t know how when we literally set up the profile properly and verified everything! And booked a place AND THEY TOOK THE NEARLY $200 OUT OF OUR ACCOUNT!!!!!!! They would NOT give us a further explanation at all and the lady would not work with us at all and HUNG UP ON ME!

I did notice that it has not been sending the check In information to the guests so they get trapped out side the gate for a while because the messages don’t come in to my phone right when they message. Also I’ve been getting guests having a hard time keeping the booking I get them confirmed and then a day later it’s canceled on them. Guest call me a lot trying to figure out how to book. Maybe make the booking a little easier. Also if you are in a state that they pay the tax for you make sure to look in to it cause they only pay the state tax not the city tax. Wish they could pay that also each quarter for me. I give Airbnb over all a 4 cause it’s good just not yet a 5 yet.

I have nothing but positive reviews and have never had a problem. It was only recently that I decided to stay at a place in which I had to evacuate twice due to a fire alarm that I had a problem with this app and the people who work for them.

I decided to contact the host asking for a refund as I was only able to stay at her place for under an hour. She proceeded to tell me that it was a false alarm both times and that she wasn’t able to refund me for even half of the money I spent, which is Airbnb policy to refund for at least 50% of the trip if it is canceled on the first night. Obviously I was very upset with the situation and so I contacted Airbnb themselves, who took weeks to reply just to tell me that there was no proof that I had to evacuate the building, even after I sent pictures of the fire trucks outside. They decided to refuse to refund me and I am still furious about the situation. I don’t plan to use this app again given my situation and I advise people to keep in mind that the customer service is VERY unprofessional and do not care about their customers.

I am not one to complain, but this app doesn’t seem to care when an inconvenience happens and it seems like they just enjoy stealing peoples money. It’s very unfortunate.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-01T14:28:00-07:00

I do have two major major issues, and that is 1). with the tax collection. My county and total sales tax are 9%, But they only take out 6% and refuse to fix it. This causes me to lose so much money because I have to take it out of my profit and then file with the county and do my state taxes through an accountant because the system is too complex... Major inconvenience... and 2). This is my 2nd home. I do not want to rent it to just “anyone“. VRBO is better because they at least let you see the person‘s full name, and you can Google their information to make sure they are a real person, etc. There are so
Many scam emails. I have no problem with an AirBNB traveler who has previously had a review, but when a New, unknown person tries to books and gives me no information at all regarding their group or info on their trip, and all I have is a “first name”- it’s unnerving. I think they should try to protect the homeowners much better than what they do right now. It’s very one-sided towards the renter- where I would like much more of a mutual accountability. Hiding the pictures and last name  is also not OK in my book.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-10T19:14:29-07:00

I am satisfied with most of my stats so far except one. This particular place was so dingy and run down that I immediately knew I did not want to stay there. Right away I contacted the host asking for the payment of my remaining two nights back so I could secure someplace else. She refused. So I contacted Air BnB and they too so long in figuring things out that I was well on to my next location by the time they said they had successfully negotiated a cleaning fee refund ($34). That was laughable. They told me I could dispute it further and asked me what was a fair compensation. I said that the fairest compensation was the two nights I had originally asked for. That would have been around $270. They negotiated some more and ended up refunding me $120. I am not impressed on the time it takes for them to respond and handle things, nor am I impressed with their negotiation skills. The place I stayed in was a dump and the pictures were a complete lie and they did nothing to fix that for future renters. I’ve now stayed in three other locations and I am very pleased with them.

I went to your q&a and found out you have a pretty strict set of rules for canceling on the host, but no real strict set of rules on hosts cancelling on guests. This is absolutely horrible. The host only loses the cancellation. The guests lose all that they had invested in the trip - airfare, other places to stay, any reservations and down payments on things like prearranged things or trips such as boating, kayaking, entry fees, etc.  Also I could not leave an Airbnb review on the host. This is absolutely uncalled for. Both the host and Airbnb need to know the consequences of this action. And others need to know that the host cancels on guests.  Airbnb really needs to rethink this policy. If a host cancel, they should be responsible for any costs that the guests incurred. I have heard that hosts will cancel if they get a higher rental fee. Don’t know if that happened to me, but that should absolutely be forbidden and if one cancellation occurs, the host should be moved to the lowest ranking. They must be discouraged from doing any cancellation.  They have to be running this like a business. The excuse I got was the host had to leave town and could not find someone to clean it before the last guest before me.

Air BnB does NOT care about their customers at all!!! Dealing with Air BnB customer service has been the worst experience I have had with any business/support team. They can check the records and see that their staff AGREED with me and believed I deserved a refund for what was essentially unsafe conditions and poor communication from a host. However, after repeated attempts to receive said refund, they then claimed I had informed them too long after the reservation. They said this a week after my reservation but I had called DURING the first hour of check in for my reservation while I was AT the residence. I wish I had recorded their calls as they do yours, when dealing with customer support, and I would easily have enough evidence to show how they are misleading, careless about customer safety, and how they tell you one thing then flip to a completely different decision without the decency to call you to elaborate. They simply sent a short, rude message on the app. It is sad that they can agree with you (they can go ahead and listen to their recorded phone calls to prove it) and then message you something completely else and ignore the fact that they ever agreed with you.

Their website allowed us to rent a unit that was not available. We were charged for the unit, then simply sent a text from another vacation site that our reservation was canceled.  No reason why! No one would tell us why, but it was glitch in air bnb software which no one would own up too.  Every case manager I was assigned too told me they would comp us a stay and send us new listings which never happened.  When a listing was sent it was not comparable to our initial booking.  Each day that passed the cost of the available air bnb units would increase in price, but no one would call me back to confirm another reservation.  Each case worker said they would call me back with in an hour.  No call backs! I am livid with air bnb, there are multiple sites that are a lot cheaper with the same units like VRBO, use them! Don’t book with this website!!  They are unreliable, they won’t care if you have a place to stay.

Update..... just received a message from Airbnb. Not a phone call of course.  They are denying telling me they would assist with the cost of another rental and their hands are tied so we should Book another rental. Never again!
