It’s an amazing social phenomenon that has become an organic part of society.  Frankly,  whether you participate not at all, or a little, or a lot you are still affected by the powers of facebook. \n\nPer my title, it’s pretty self evident, but one thing that really irks me is that the Facebook algorithm decides, seemingly arbitrarily, to choose to show me just some responses to posts rather than all comments. I prefer to make my own decision on what is relevant to me, and many times things that they leave out of “most relevant“ I think are excellent comments. But, in order to see those comments I have to go in and physically change that setting every-single-time. \n\nThat’s one that I can clearly see.  I don’t know, however, if the rumors about restricting my access to people’s posts is true, but there are certainly things that don’t pop up for me that I would be really interested in, for example things my daughter posts. Somehow, she didn’t make the algorithm cut for getting a regular spot in my feed (as opposed to some people I knew 20 years ago for whom I see every single thing they post). So, come on Facebook!

I do find when using phone or iPad app I have difficulty getting to settings to eliminate having their comments or likes of friends appear on my page. Ditto what I recently wrote. Since upgrading this app in Oct 2014, it has gone further downhill. When wanting to add a pic, I used to be able to go to an album in iPhoto, but now I can't. In other words, I would keep all the cute pics for birthdays in one album. Now I have to hunt for a picture. Also, there are ads covering up parts of articles and have trouble closing the ad so I can read the article. Some comments stay the same. Nice to have FB in phone especially when out or traveling.

I have reported it and others have as well, but nothing has been done. I get a message back saying there is nothing wrong with these posts. I have been harassed on others posts by illegitimate people whose profiles are always fake military men or at least that is what they present on their profiles and they always want to be friends with me and others. These profiles are obviously fake, but when I turn it in I get a message back saying they are okay and I can block them. Why should I be the one to do this? It does not help others when I block them, they just get me with another one of their fake profiles, so I am continuously blocking. These need to be researched, because they are definitely fake and it should be obvious if the reviewers were investigating complaints. I love FB, but have looked into other platforms, because of this. Also, removing posts that are very obviously not against community standards, like recipes or songs shared.

To share the whole story, it did work once, but then the video failed after a minute due to wi-fi signal issues.  Before and after that tiny success, the video does not start in landscape mode.  It does start with no difficulty in portrait mode, but none of the videos I wish to create and share are in that mode.  I have used the landscape mode for years now, with no difficulties like this.

I never did find them in my feed — I had to go to notifications and tapped on one of the notifications telling me I got a birthday wish which took me to my greetings.  I’m sorry, but even if they weren’t birthday wishes, shouldn’t I be immediately seeing posts that just happened yesterday?  One of my greetings had an avatar in it and a link for me to follow if I want to make an avatar too.  I followed it and it said my app is out of date (which is strange since I have auto-update set on apps) and took me to the App Store were it did *not* show any updates to be installed.  I deleted the app and re-installed it, thinking that should fix it, but it didn’t.  Since FB has no customer support (I guess they think they’re perfect so they don’t need it) there’s nothing to do.

The updating issues stem from updated listing items. Items on discount don’t always show to the public. I get messages that there are offers on items or that an item has sold and marketplace won’t let me connect to those messages. You have to really really dig to find them. There isn’t a way to filter unread messages and a whole host of notifications give you an unread message notification. If I contact someone about their item and they sell it to someone else or mark it pending I get a message notification but unless I find the exact conversation, that someone sold an item on, it remains in the corner. It can be hard to keep up with actual buyers when the notifications are just red herrings most of the time.

Around 2019 Facebook became a cesspool of HATE AND BIGOTRY. 2023 all the funny content and family social interaction is now gone.

I just slowly began deleting friends and family and kept begging Facebook to please stop putting racist content on my timeline. It’s gotten to the point that I only use Facebook to connect my games to for saving purposes. Facebook has officially become Hatebook. It’s too much hate in the world already.

Congress should get real about who’s really violating the US’s privacy and stop lying to manipulate the narrative all for your personal interest. If it’s data insecurity, Tiktok has secured our data better than any current US application. So that can’t be the problem.
