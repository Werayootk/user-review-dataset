I previously used Google Authenticator for most of my accounts and ended up losing a couple accounts over that. This app pulled the rug from under Google’s alternative and forced them to update their app after two years to make it actually usable for their consumers. Even after the updates, this app reigns supreme with the great abundance of security features it provides to users. Although the smoothness in transitions and smooth feel of the app overall be better, the UI is modern and I applaud Microsoft for that. I’d also like to applaud them for pushing the application heavily on their website. Even more people deserve to know about it and I believe it should be also pushed in advertisements. All in all, this is as close to perfection any authentication app has ever gotten and by far.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-07T20:40:35-07:00

But if you grab another device that’s not yours it will ask for a password. I think this is the way it works. Not 100% sure. I think this is a great idea to make it more seamlessly for the user.

But could use some improvements,"Overall, I love the app. It does its job and I can't argue with its functionality. However, I give it a four star because I do have a few concerns and complaints I'd like to see implemented. Its the simple aesthetics of the design of the authenticator. I would love to see folder/group settings implemented where you can group codes together under a drop down menu, instead of just having a whole spew of a list of random codes you have to scroll through. Something similar to the functionality of 2FAS Auth. 

Another thing I'd love to see would be Icons used instead of a boring, plain grey, busthead (maybe use the MS MFA logo?) When a logo isn't supported. Which I would like to also see more support on is icon support from various different services. I find only few companies like FB, Gitbub, and a few others are on the app. Again, I think my biggest complaint is to make it look more sexy of a design and UX. It's kind of boring at the moment.

You probably obtained this app in order to login to Microsoft 365 with MFA.  If you are a system administrator type you probably have about 30 Microsoft 365 Accounts.  

Then you decide to get a new phone and you learn that the keys used to generate codes  cannot be transferred to the new phone.  This app has the word “backup” but it does not make a useful backup.  It will perform the restore just fine and you will see every account you had, and they will all be broken. you will have to log into each and every account individually and create a new MFA device.

This app is incredibly dangerous, you should stay away from it.  It gives you a false sense of security. It should simply tell you it’s not capable of backing up secret keys for Microsoft 365 Accounts.

To be fair, it does back up secret keys for non-Microsoft accounts.  

If you use literally any other authenticator app, it will back up all of your secret keys, unlike this app.  I believe it’s against Apple’s rules to name the names of those other apps in this review, but I can tell you I have personally used them all, and I just got done restoring codes from about six different apps, and only Microsoft is unable to restore Secret keys.

This app is a dangerous menace.   Do not be foolish enough to trust its claims of performing a backup or you will be sorry.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=983156458&type=Purple%20Software,2023-09-30T06:25:28-07:00

I’m glad I have this handy app that will let me deny the request and block them! Ha take that hacker!” 

The next time I tried to check email in Outlook, Authenticator immediately said that I denied the request, even though it never gave me the option. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling this app and Outlook, called my company help desk, tried the Microsoft Support option, so far, no one has been able to fix it. So, from my experience, if you block unauthorized access to your account, which is the sole purpose of this app, your account will be permalocked and will be very difficult or (so far for me) impossible to unlock.

Now my organization moved to using the type of authentication where you have to enter a number from the login screen into your authenticator. Unfortunately, this renders the watch app useless as you can’t enter that number on the watch.

The thing is, there’s no technical reason for this. Typing numbers on the watch is easy. But the app doesn’t support letting me do that. So logging in with the app, which used to be a very quick and easy occasion, is now a huge pain point in my day.

There is apparently no other way of logging in either. And that’s when it even admits that you have a Microsoft account, which it occasionally won’t do. This has happened 3 times now. Updating and removing the app doesn’t help, I’ve tried. Sometimes it’ll make you endlessly authenticate something on a loop forever. Forget about being able to use it if you upgrade your phone. Everything is gone after that.  I’ve never seen an app work this poorly.

I wish that transferring my data from my old phone to my new phone was a little bit easier.

Those codes are supposed to be offline to protect them, and they don’t need network access by design.

So now we can’t use the app or view our existing codes unless we agree to activate invisible data collection that opens the app up to a host of potential bugs and attacks. All so they can collect data they don’t need constantly from users that aren’t having a problem with the app.

The companies that make the iOS “telemetry “ tools have introduced bugs into the apps that incorporate them already. They will do it again, and some of the users of these apps are protecting important assets or systems.
