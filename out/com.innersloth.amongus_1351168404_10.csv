If there wasn’t a problem I wouldve rated 5 stars,"Naturally hosting a lobby takes a lot of time to fill up of course, but it’s even longer when you put the lobbies with the least amount of people at the bottom which is why they should be at the top because when I tap the top one it says full and I have to scroll down anyways. And when I'm hosting a lobby it takes 5-10 minutes on average to get to 2 people! But when I am 9 players somehow I get to 10 with a minute. I find this very odd. Now it could be people just join the fullest lobby, but I think it’s because people are lazy and dont scroll to the lower lobbies which are less full. I mean a game that is exploding as it is shouldn't have this problem either. So devs please move the less full lobbies to the top of the menu. Also it wouldn't hurt to have us have things to do in the lobby like I dont know a maze? Maybe add a jump button, so we can have parkour while waiting? A tic tac toe station? Where it can hold 5 pairs? Seriously it’s boring waiting this long to fill up, and thought to right this it took so long.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-19T18:55:04-07:00
6548550928,xd Swazzy,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id881840214,2020.9.9,5,Just some ideas,"It would be cool if you guys added a feature that gives imposters a chance to do limited amounts of tasks. This would prevent people from singling you out and add more strategy in how you can blend in. Obviously you dont want to let the crew members win, therefore you have to balance both aspects of killing but not raising suspicion. A friends list or party system would allow you to easily meet up with your friends and play in together besides setting up private lobbies. A ranked playlist could add more depth, and statistics too would also be beneficial in understanding your play-style and or skill level. I’d also like to see different game modes and newer or bigger maps were you can have up to 15 players and 4 imposters, but I feel that could be too hectic. Definitely do add a separate voice chatting system where the dead could communicate besides when meetings are taking place, that way you don’t feel bored listening to nothing in between discussions. This are just a few changes I’d like to see to the game, but they’re just ideas.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-18T08:39:38-07:00

Among us is original, makes some GOOD memes and there are a decent amount of ads! I don't have much to say about among us except for how it's perfect, but I do have a couple recommendations. 1. You guys should add a feature where the imposters can chat while everyone else is doing the tasks. I feel like it would be a lot cooler! 2. make the items that you can buy with real money a bit cheaper. I don't really worry about this one too much anyway, because it doesn't matter how u look, but for the people who want to buy it might think it's not worth it. My final one, 3. Make the pets get to do a little more. All the pets can do is make a scared/ sad reaction when you die. They also follow you. I'm not sure what you could add, but it would be great if you can also make it so they can have the same outfit or hat as you! That would be really cute! But all of those ideas are ur choice. I'm just recommending some ideas to make the game much cooler or fun.

I love this game and it is a ton of fun, but there are few ideas I had in mind to make the game better! 1. Emotes : let say every time you win a game you coins and you add a shop! You can buy emotes, hats, skins, and maybe death animations! 2. More maps : I think it would be cool if you guys added more maps and ones with new aspects like instead of vents for the murderer, They can go through holes in the wall! 3. Go to other people : there are a lot of other talented out there that have good ideas and if games turned to you tubers and memers the game could be some much better! 4. Items : if you had items around the map and it took about three seconds to pick up I think it would be a cool aspect to the game! Like if the lights are out, you could find a flashlight and see so you know who’s coming, or you can use items to complete missions like if you need to connect the wires you need pliers!     
    I hope you take these into consideration and I think it would make the game so much cooler! 😄

READ PLEASE,"I really love the way this game is formatted however I have found myself to disliking some things or in need of adding in the game to make it even better! First I would live to have a voice chat system in the game, obviously optional and you can mute yourself or speak. You would also be able to ban people who cheated with it.) Second, this is a dire need which is a friend system and it would work as if someone was in a game but was already full then you can’t join it, but if the game they are in isn’t full you can still join them. And of course, a chatting system with friends. Another thing that would be great is adding more people in games, for instance since you can have 10 people and two importers, then you can have 15 people and three imposters, and 20 people and 4 imposters, lost goes on or you can double imposters each time just an example.) But with all that adding I think you would attract way more people and have a way higher demand of people wanting to play and it would be way more enjoyable!

Because I don’t want to waste your time, I’ll get straight to the point, because I’m only a kid and because of some glitch, I can’t create an account. Even if this glitch hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have had that much fun. Because of the limitations brought on by Quick Chat and no name changing, unless you get an account, the ability to enjoy the game greatly decreases. The whole point of the game was to explain that you weren’t imposter or to say how you know that red is the imposter or to say that pink is a crewmate. Limiting that is just counterintuitive! Yeah, people abused the power to be hateful. I know that’s the reason you made the change. But still, you didn’t have to remove that privilege entirely! I’m still giving this game 5 stars because of all the fun I’ve had playing before, but I hope you at least acknowledge that what you did wasn’t the only option.

That excitement ended toward the game in around February-June 2021 and me and lots of my friends haven’t even tried to join it after that. But then me and my friends had downloaded it because we got told there was tons of new updates to get more people! When we did that we found the chat update, name update, etc. they were TERRIBLE! You couldn’t change your name so it automatically changed to the one you last had before the update, or the games choice if you had downloaded it after that update… I was very upset after this and joined a game. You couldn’t chat your choice of words!! How stupid is that? I believe it’s because they were some inappropriate things said besides swear words. In my opinion they should’ve just added more restrictions such as more tags, and not letting us just say those things! It was very hard to get out of saying you were imposter… if you want to play this and you have roblox just go to the roblox among us… it’s so much bettter.

Omg, before Innersloth took away the chatting, I used to LOVE this game so much. I would get so excited and look forward to playing this game with my friends every day after school. But now, I barely ever play anymore. The concept of the game is great, but the fun part of this game was being able to talk to people and explain to them why you’re not the impostor. But now, you can’t even do that. Look, I get that you guys are only trying to make the game safer. But there are other ways to make it safer. With the new updates, you can always report someone if they’re saying anything inappropriate. And the game always bleeps out swear words anyways. Trust me, SO MANY more people would play this game if you listened to all of us trying to tell you that taking away the chat completely takes away the fun of the game. Everyone, please spread the word.

I met a lot of people here and we became friends and I was really happy… until the update. I really hate the fact we can’t type. I hate it so much that I’m actually considering deleting the game. I know some idiots are mean and racist and curse all the time. I met a few of those, but they were rare. So I really don’t like that because of a few people that can’t be civil, now we can’t chat freely and enjoy our time in the game. It takes forever to find what to say with the new text-picking feature. Also, this is something that bothered me from the beginning, but I hate that a lot of people leave the game after it barely starts only because they aren’t impostors. I wish people wouldn’t be able to leave once the game starts. Maybe if they get killed they can leave, but not right at the beginning because then the game either ends too quick or it’s just not fun because there’s too little players and that’s just boring.

It makes it so you can’t type in the message bar which makes it impossible to defend yourself or explain any situation to incriminate someone. It’s way less fun and basically zero interaction. I kid you not you have to go into a pop up screen that gives u possible text options to send into the chat and you can only send those and nothing else. You can’t call ppl by their colors- only names now. On top of the fact that you can’t interact with ppl in a way that is constructive, it freezes and glitches out all the time. The new map is really big but you can’t even enjoy it bcuz of all the glitching. Also the skeld in now inverted so everything is backwards. At first I thought someone hacked it but turns out that is just the update. I didn’t check Mira or Polus to see if they changed because I got so frustrated with the stupid update I contemplated ways to physically burn an app.  It’s very much less fun and not worth it.

I have played this with my friends, my family, and it’s all over the internet, this game is awesome!

But maybe you could add a few things. A mic would be helpful it’s hard to type so much and some people will get killed because  they just can’t type very fast but it should be optional. also friends would be so useful cause I’m a kid and I don’t want to be traumatized by inappropriate stuff so my parents making friends so I can play with more freedom rather then only having private games would be amazing. If you do the mic Maybe a chat whenever your close to a person so you can say “hey let’s stick together” without waiting for a meeting and it would be useful to say “hey me and green got this” if the reactor was melting down so they could do their tasks. Maybe a imposter chat tho that would have to be optional otherwise some people might find it unfair. one more thing for newbs you have to play and it’ll take time and failure to learn but once you do you have a blast!over all a great game favorite non console game keep up the good work.🤩🤩🤩

6553336902,Cozyboyjayy,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id736678886,2020.9.9,4,Too many hackers and children (Angry review),"For an online game thats usually filled with lobbies of 12 and 14 year olds.. there is a lot of racism and cursing. But thats not the worst part. You can censor the chat or ignore it. The worst part is the hackers, who call out imposters before an imposter kills. Or if the hacker is imposter, once the chat figures out who killed who the hacker ends the meeting or ends the game. If i play 20 games in 1 day i will run into 10-15 hackers that day. Probably more if i decide to play with 3 imposters instead of 2. So i dont play anymore unless i have my own group of friends. I also never get imposter so it gets bored fast unless youre lucky. One thing ill say, ive never ran into a hacker or someone who is blatantly cheating on Clash Royale. 

P.S these little children get mad when they arent imposter and leave the game. You guys need to do better than what you already have in place, when it comes to dealing with babies. Punish them with maintenance breaks. 1 hour at the least if you leave a game more than 3 times within a certain time frame. I dont know but i wont be playing anymore.

This has only happened once but was SOOOO FRUSTRATING so I joined the server some other people joined and they started the whole map was black and I could just move around and I chatted “whats going on?” And right after I got kicked and a box popped up saying “U were kicked for hacking, please stop” and I didn’t even do anything 😡, 3. STOP THOSE ONLINE DATERS They are sooooo many people out there who are cursing in the chats and dating and chatting inappropriate things, I know there’s a kick button but wouldn’t it be better if u could just blur out the inappropriate words when the chat it it would be much better. The most that sticks out with me is the servers I will sit there for 20 minutes and just click away and get “server has already started” or “games full” when it says 1/10.

Some of my apps have gone idle because of this game. (I’m not addicted to it. No worries.) But I have a couple ideas that would make the game more interesting. And fun for the impostor. However, this first idea would make it easier for the impostor to win. When players are hosting a game, you should have this setting that allows the impostors to steal, I’m guessing it’s an iPad you vote on, letting the impostor have multiple votes. I just thought that maybe you could make the game more interesting including an “Impostor Rob” mode. Also, this is my last idea since I’m already wasting enough of your time.

But, first of all, sometimes when I try to join a game it always says they are full, or they already started. This doesn’t make sense to me because the match maker is supposed to find games for you that AREN’T FULL and AREN’T STARTED ALREADY. It even says that ones with 2 or 3 people in it are full. Plz get that fixed. Something else that annoys me is that sometimes it tells me I’m running an older version of the game. So I go into settings and the App Store and it wont let me update it.I tried both. Is there a certain way I have to do it?? And Lastly there are a lot of online daters. ALOT. Sometimes people have inappropriate names. Can you find a way to stop that? Like make sure “hot girl” and “single boy” and THAT kinda stuff aren’t allowed in the games? I understand that the operators can’t sit there all day reading EVERY SINGLE WORTHLESS REVIEW. But other people have written stuff like this and these seem to be the main issues. If these are fixed then I will definitely give you a five star rating.

The stupid quick chat :/

Alright this game is perfect but I’m begging for you to please, PLEASE get rid of this dumb quick chat because when you free chat you can type proper stuff but the quick chat has down sides, the down sides are you cannot socialize with people well, secondly you cannot use quick chat without being called “suspicious” from a random person, finally not enough proper evidence of things, like for example: if I saw someone vent to navigation to somewhere else, I cannot just chat in quick chat and say “a person in navigations vented idk who but” but if I was silent and did not say nothing, I’d get voted out.

First things first anonymity is great on this app, but, there should be a system where you can follow someone else so you guys can play games together another time. Also, the chat, I know you want things to be PG and before people were saying inappropriate things, but there is definitely a better way. Maybe have an option to report people if they say inappropriate things and than you can ban them. You’ll have to figure something out because thats one of the reasons I stopped playing. I couldn’t say things fast enough and I never got to speak. Or you could put people with accounts that have their age in the same games, so like only put people with the same age in the same games.

Yesterday I was playing, and there was a hacker in the game I was playing in, and I didn’t want to report because I couldn’t say “-person x- is a hacker.” 
Also, before you could play hide and seek, if the host of the game decides this, and this was a good way to learn how to play the game with other people. I know the free play mode is supposed to do this, but in free play, unless you have someone else nearby to play with, your on your own. Also, I’m free play, there is no imposter. All free play seems good for is just learning the tasks. Even then, you can take your time. You don’t have to rush because you know any minutes you could be dead, and that’s what’s fun. The anticipation. I used to play this game everyday, for a while each day because it was fun. It was challenging. 

Now, since you can’t say what you want, you ask others to watch you do a visual task. You can’t stop people from voting you. You can’t defend yourself. Your stuck to cleverly craft sentences from the selections they give you. I used to love this game.

Update: Hello, I’m back after the latest update. As many of the other players, I’m not a fan of the new update. You see, the chat wheel limits what you can say as a younger player and it’d be better if younger players could type like any other player and have the wheel as well. Also, I was playing on the map Polus and the outside flooring was dark purple. I don’t see the point of changing the color, but that’s not the point. The point is that the lava pool was also dark purple, but you can see the tiny lava jumping as the normal color. It looks horrible. I don’t know if it’s a bug or something, but p l e a s e fix it.

The first bug I noticed was around the time the update came. The game, no matter how many times I tried, refused to update. I did everything I could, I even tried deleting and reinstalling the game, but it’s still wouldn’t work. Because if this, I was constantly being kicked out of servers simply because the game wouldn’t update. After many more tries, I did in fact get the game to update. But it was after this update that I started getting even more issues. 
Now that I have the update, I get kicked form servers. I join a game with a black screen, and I’m rarely join any games by clicking the join a game button. It will say that the game is full, even though it only has one player listed as already being in the lobby. It’s extremely frustrating that cannot play this game, especially when I love it so much.

The bits about deception is fun and since there hasn’t been really any good free online multiplayer games in 2020, especially more and it’s been annoying because of that and the pandemic. The game has some downsides though. Firstly that a lot of people in the game curse and that’s not fun, I see that there is a filter in place that’s default, but it can mess up sometimes, and the second problem is the minor violence. I have some friends who want to have a game night with me, the problem is the some of them are a bit sensitive to violence. I would really love to have some sort of setting that removes all blood and instead of a body there is a grave that corresponds with what color that the player is, for example yellow died so the grave is yellow. Also when another play sees someone kill his fellow crewmate, there is no blood, and the kill animation that the crewmate who died had just was [impostors name] killed you.

Also when u get imposter people just leave because they are crew mate. I think new roles would be nice so more people would play. Like a sheriff or cop or something that only that one person votes out everyone else just talks on what they see. Make like 15 max 1,2, or 3 imposter like normal. 2 cops and the rest crewmates.

I know that quick chat makes parents feel safer about their kids playing the game and stuff, but among us isn’t like it used to be with the quick chat. The games aren’t as fun. People can’t get across their points quick enough, and they can’t really provide evidence as to who it is. What if somebody’s older brother or sister wants to play but the game is on quick chat since their little brother or sister isn’t old enough? I tried, but you can’t change your age. Deleting and redownloading the app doesn’t work either. This shouldn’t stop you from playing the game, since it is still just as good, and with the new airship map, it’s even more amazing! If there’s any way you can improve the quick chat, that would be nice. EDIT/ADDON: I forgot to mention a big problem with the update here: I can’t even set up my account. It won’t let me. The “continue” button so I can make an account (I’m on an Apple iPad) just disappears! This is very disappointing, and I’m not sure I really like this update.

6570674465,#updats,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id756107471,2020.9.9,5,BEST GAME EVER,"I love this game so much! One of my favorite games to play whenever I’m with my friends. But I was wondering about an update that should be coming out soon. I heard that there will be some new colors in the game, that sounds SO COOL! Eek I can’t wait! But the update that makes me the most excited is the update where you will be able to add friends, this made me soo happy! I’ve met some AMAZING people on this game, some people I still keep in touch with, but I think that it would make things a ton easier if there was a add friend button. It would make things easier because then people would not have to share personal information online. And about personal information...this part kinda scares me, I have also received some in-game messages from people saying if I don’t contacts ta curtain number my device will be hacked. Is there a way to prevent things like this? If there is that would help a LOT and I will feel a lot more comfortable playing this game that I love soo much! 
Thank you so much!

But just today I was trying to play the game so I pressed the online option and it said something (I don’t remember what it said) but it wasn’t working even if I hosted a game. And it kept say to try again in a few minutes, so I did, and almost all of the servers that said 2/10 said that the server was full and I was unable to join. I’ve also noticed that it does that a lot. Even if it has like 7/10 and it isn’t full. But then I was finally able to join one server and the lobby was completely black and I was only able to see me and the other player, and the chat and settings symbols and the info about the game. So I did what most people would do, I was going to ask what was happening in the chat but then I got kicked. I’m not sure why Among is isn’t working but please fix it. I’ve also been seeing a ton of reviews saying that people got hacked, and I really don’t want to be hacked. Nobody does, so please find some way to fix that to. Thank you for reading this, and if you are the developer/developers please respond.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-24T12:16:50-07:00

But recently like today I logged in to my steam account and then went on among us I was excited to play because I had been watching some videos! Then the process to get my account on among us back was great (I hadn’t played in a while so that’s why I had to put it on again). Ohh but then…but thennnn… I clicked find game and then it loaded and loaded until it stoped and left me at the same part…so I tried again and again andddd again…I even tried to make a game to see if that would work but no. Then I was trying all sorts of things like reloading among us and stuff. This one combination got me farther just to a black screen and then back to where I started, I did this for a good 10 minutes. I payed for among us on pc mind you and that’s what annoys me. You might be thinking oh it’s just her pc thennnn…NOPE EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WORKING JUST FINE. So either it could just be me or the day, the luck of the day or you could please help. Because I wanna PLAY! Oh yeah so over all I couldn’t play at ALL😡.Then I just gave up… So please helllpppp!!!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-11-07T13:12:54-07:00
7974869501,lexie sounds crazy,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1332828880,2021.6.30,3,Great game but lots of ruiners.,"Hello! I just wanted to say that Among Us is a great game! But it would be great if you could add a little more improvement to the FreePlay mode. So, When your playing FreePlay, The bots somehow do NOT move. I just wanted to ask if you can make the BOTS in FreePlay move and play like a Normal Human Player! They dont have to have Opinions/Talk during meetings, But can they please Not stand in the same place the whole round? Because your usually always Imposter, And it would kind of be easy for the Imposter/You to kill the bots. The only good thing about them is that they stand in Random places and it kind of makes it hard for you to find them which is Great and Challenging! But when your designing your game, Please have FreePlay in mind as a game people can play! Even though most of the people would choose the public mode, Theres still people that will and can choose that mode! Just because most of the people that play this game decide to play in a Public mode doesn’t mean that EVERYONE will choose this mode. I mean people like to Practice in Freeplay as a guider too. So pleasee improve this mode! Thank you!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-31T11:51:25-07:00
7495429573,xx_LemonBoy_xx,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1247259165,2021.6.15,1,Awesome then horrible,"The game used to be an awesome game to play with friends, or to play by yourself in a public lobby! I have met lots of nice people in public lobbies, and you could chat until the game started and then play and kill each other and it was super fun! But when the new update came out it RUINED the game! The ability to talk, form connections and discuss clues was ruined, and now it’s just “blank killed blank in blank” or “blank vented” which is no fun at all! I understand why this had to happen due to people abusing the chat ability but please please find some way for us to communicate semi freely! Also the account. Please add other ways to make an account besides an Apple ID for us iPhone users, because some apple IDs for kids are set up to where we can’t make accounts using it on other games and apps, and now my name has to be funnytoes. Not very funny! The game before the new update was awesome, and granted it had its’ small annoyances, was so much better than after… I would like to see the chat get fixed in the future and then maybe I would come back, and it would be awesome if you added more roles and modes! But THE CHAT. Please please please fix it because it ruins everything about the game!

7419036298,batmanfan765,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id26392323,2021.5.25,3,The Recent Update Ruined this Great Game,"I love Among Us. It’s easily one of my favorite mobile games and I’ve been playing it since last September. The concept and gameplay is fun, easy to pick up, and gets you thinking. However, there is a recent update that immediately turned me off from playing the game anymore, and that is the new Quick Chat. Although you claim that it is quicker and safer to use, it is not quick, and in fact it is really hard to match up something you are thinking with what’s in the Quick Chat wheel. The whole point of Among Us is to find out who the impostor is, and if you can’t ask important questions which are mostly unavailable from the Quick Chat wheel then it ruins the fun out of all of it. I get that you guys want to get rid of trolls and keep children safe, but think of some better alternative than this. Also, please do not make it required for people above 13. They are not children, and this Quick Chat ruins the experience more than getting banned for no reason by a toxic host, which just like this should be fixed, but isn’t as bad as the Quick Chat.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-02T13:25:13-07:00

And I saw the update and everything was new. I went to account and changed my name to a random to see if I would like it, obviously not. So I went to change my name. And I cant. I go in the host and change my avatar and than go back to see if changing something will let me change my own name. Yet it still doesn’t. I do not like this part of the update. Please change it. But do not allow users like suckmyd or suckmypuss.       It really isn’t fun not being able to change your name. Your giving the problem to everyone. I love the new update though it just needs the name changing. Thank you for reading. 

PS. I hope this helps you understand that people do not like this too. If they are in the same problem, they need your help to change that. And if they can’t change their account, they really need you. And I can’t even change my account since my Apple ID doesn’t work for this game and I can’t change my account. I don’t originally have one too. So please put the name randomizer away.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2021-05-17T13:56:43-07:00

basically the game is about there is a murderer on the loose and when you play the game you are either imposter or crewmate and what the crew make does is they do tasks and go around the ship doing tasks to help the ship get a little better working and repairing the ship and if you’re an imposter then you are the murder and the thing is this game is about of course a murderer on the loose as I said and so if you are imposter you are being able to kill anybody but however you have to have a cool down which once you kill somebody you’re gonna have to wait at least maybe like 10 seconds to kill another person and I recommend the best place to kill is in electrical because you have a vent there and I’ll let you figure out the rest about the game good luck a adventure awaits you!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1351168404&type=Purple%20Software,2020-12-06T20:05:33-07:00
