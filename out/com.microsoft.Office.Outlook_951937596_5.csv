For starters, it’s very hard to search things in my emails. The app takes way too much liberty interpreting terms that are similar to my search terms.

Also doesn’t show me which email the term is found in, instead it randomly shows other emails from the thread that don’t even contain those words… 
The other thing that is really missing but should be such a basic function, is to be able to check the calendar while you compose an email.

When it comes to reading and composing emails, it does what it’s supposed to do. But a few (what some would see as minor) things are incredibly annoying. Why in the world can’t I customize my font when composing emails? This seems like an easy feature to provide. Why is it 2024 and we can’t get our email signatures to look the way we want them to look? And don’t get me started with trying to include images in them. Again, a few steps short of perfect.
