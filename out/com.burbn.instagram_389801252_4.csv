Can‚Äôt forget about when I was trying to get help with my account issue I‚Äôm having, but theirs no email or phone number you can contact about for any customer support which is outrageous for a platform who‚Äôs supposed to meet supply and demand and actually help their customers who use their services.

They don‚Äôt care how their users feel about the new algorithm updates. Don‚Äôt bother trying to make a complaint, no one will respond. Your content gets restricted or shadow banned depending on what you post or what hashtags you use. If you‚Äôre a conservative, don‚Äôt bother using this bias platform to voice your opinions, they will shut you down. You‚Äôll see the same 20 people on your timeline regardless of how many 1000s you follow. Advertising is everywhere and can‚Äôt be avoided! Don‚Äôt post often? Consider your account deleted for not using it. The new algorithm makes you interact more with followers so that your content is seen but yet my likes continue to drop and more of my longtime followers have unfollowed me. When I message them to ask why they all said they didn‚Äôt unfollow me and thought I did. So not only does Instagram restrict accounts they don‚Äôt like or consider popular but will also remove some of your most active followers to keep your content from being seen. They act as if they are too good to be true but are really setting themselves up to less than MySpace in a few years.

The ""solution"" was to help you stay up to date with the posts you miss, but now I am missing more posts in my feed than before because of this system. I recommend making it an option in settings to turn on chronological order of your feed, it would make things so much easier. Another issue I have is that I recently noticed that the accounts you follow are no longer in chronological order either? There seems to be no organized way they are put in order, it's just like it was randomly thrown in there like that. This proves to be very difficult for me to find accounts I have recently followed as they no longer show up at the top of my followed box.

Even worse than how badly my posts perform on this platform compared to others like Tiktok, it is difficult to find relevant content in the home page feed and the discover page. My home page is plagued by posts that are mis-hashtagged, and the discover page is often a cesspool of content I have never interacted with. I will also be shown posts that I have already seen multiple times. Not to mention how difficult it is to find anything by searching for it; unless you select a hashtag, there is no way to filter the results by popular, recent, etc. Much of the time, searching key words will only produce a page full of users whose names contain the terms, even if you do not select the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô section to search specifically.

Between the lack of attention the company puts in to what people are posting, to a few irritating things that come along with it, I unfortunately would not recommend anymore. For example, many times that I open my phone, I see sexual explicit content that would be available to ANYONE on the app. I understand that it may be certain accounts that you follow, but in my opinion that should not matter. As an adult, the only issue is that it can be uncomfortable to open the app in public. On the other hand, kids opening the app at places such as school could get in trouble for such content being present on their screen, EVEN THOUGH they had absolutely no intention of something like that being the first thing they see when they open this app. Another irritating component is scrolling through my feed daily and seeing posts from WEEKS ago that I have already watched, liked, etc. Also, somehow I follow these random/spam accounts that I know, for a fact, I did not follow. Very frustrating.

Starting  January 1st 2023 I will not longer be on Instagram and I suggest you do the same.

Video scrolling is too addicting and not what instagram is; until there is a way to disable reels I will not even consider coming back to this platform. 

If anyone with Meta or now formerly employed with Meta after the large layoffs, reads this understand this.

I was never able to speak to anyone on the Instagram team about regaining access to my account, and ended up having to make a whole new account.

I think one of the main reasons people use Instagram is because they prefer that diversity between apps; even though it‚Äôs owned by Facebook. Not to mention the fact that now, the DM‚Äôs look scarily similar to messenger. I have to ask exactly why? Users prefer differences between their apps. If they wanted a messenger-like experience, they‚Äôd get messenger. I‚Äôd greatly appreciate the app to not lose a significant amount of user support. Also, the algorithm has consistently failed us. If you could address and correct these problems before they become even more of an issue, that would be great. Facebook to most Instagram users, it leads a feeling of uncertainty and mistrust.

Honestly the changes you‚Äôve been making make me not want to use the app anymore, some new features are nice but some are a complete failure.

It honestly feels like you haven‚Äôt tested this because across the app people are complaining and also, for users who make posts with multiple images, it‚Äôs a nightmare because you already use horizontal scrolling for that but now you have to be careful not to tap the wrong part or you‚Äôll scroll past the post or be stuck on the post when you intended to do something else.

6542949483,Graciouskay,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id363751390,163.0,5,Could IG Develop backup protections for users?,"I LOVE Instagram. It is my absolute favorite social media platform. A few weeks ago, my account was accidentally disabled by IG for what appears to be what was a perceived impersonation account. Of course, I was not impersonating myself, but as a global nonprofit advocate and musician, I was devastated by the potential reality that I could lose everything after years of international connections. Thankfully the error was discovered, and my account was restored! 
While it‚Äôs important for entrepreneurs to have their own subscribers, is there a new innovation that IG can develop that would serve as a ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù or ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù that if innocent accounts are permanently disabled, there is some way for them to restore their posts and followers? I know this is a reach, but it astounds me that this isn‚Äôt in place when it‚Äôs so easy for an account to be mistaken as fraudulent or hacked, as IG seeks to combat real fraudulent accounts. & this is happening more and more to accounts where people have worked hard to build their following, helping to bring healthy engagement and traffic to the IG community.

My posts are only being seen by under 100 people most days and are not being boosted in the last year on my IPhone 14 pro and also on the Samsung Ultra S22 pro. Also, Instagram promotes bad behavior by not informing you when someone unfollows you which lets people play the follow and unfollow game. Then when I look at each person I am following to see if they are still following me, after 10 minutes Instagram stops me from performing this action...Why???? I should have a right to look at who is unfollowing me? Yet, you stop me from doing this action and allow all the accounts that are up to no good like asking for money and other things, creepers, people who follow and unfollow, people buying followers, people who never like posts, etc. but I can‚Äôt look at each person that I am unfollowing? Dr. Phil would rip you all apart for such juvenile and unprofessional behavior. Instagram continuously rewards bad behavior‚Ä¶. Also, why are being forced to do reels when some people just want to post photos? I have reported all of this and how my posts are not being boosted for the last year and nothing is ever done. I have watched accounts who started after me thousands of followers and their posts are being boosted by over 500 people and more‚Ä¶.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-16T19:03:55-07:00

Second, this is a problem that is probably not common, but it is extremely annoying‚ÄîI delete the app from my phone frequently when I have a lot of work to do so that I am not distracted. Despite this app definitely tracking my data and knowing that I have had an account for years now, everytime I redownload it, it will pause any audio or video that is playing to show me every single functionality on the app. Not only this, but some of these tutorials do not go away until you use the feature they are suggesting, which completely interrupts what you were doing. If I check my story, I do not need to be told, in succession, twice each, that I can add it to my highlights or share it as a reel. I do not need to be told, while watching a reel, that there is a home for watching reels on the app and have you interrupt the reel itself. You do not need to remind me how to share posts.

However, this new update that has completely changed the look of my home feed is the most undesirable thing on this planet. It is downright annoying to even scroll down to see my friend‚Äôs photos to the point where i end up only looking at stories. It was so much better when you can smoothly scroll down. Why give up an iconic part of this app just to accommodate for reels that nobody asked for? It is frustrating, especially because of how much I used to use this app. I would genuinely want more advertisements than this dumb new feed. By the way, the only way you can really beat tiktok is if you actually listen to people that use this app and you stick to being an APP USED TO POST PICTURES. Look at twitter and how they continue to thrive because of how they stay true to themselves. So facebook can stick to it‚Äôs original home feed look but instagram can‚Äôt? Great job instagram, I now use twitter and instagram more because you guys continue to add fix things that nobody asked you to fix! At least make it an option to be able to use the old feed style.

They suggested Instagram which I was the only one who didn‚Äôt have it. So I made an account, but I had to wait 24 hours for verification. I couldn‚Äôt do anything like fill in my bio or description. So I waited it out. And by the time the 24 hours passed, I tried to log in, and I was told that my account was deactivated for violating the rules. What are they talking about? I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. You mean I waited for 24 hours just to be told that my account was deactivated. For violating the guidelines which I didn‚Äôt? I mean what heck Instagram? If you wanted new members into your app, at least let them do something instead of throwing the ban hammer at people who couldn‚Äôt even write anything in their bio.

I wanted this fix so I contacted Instagram via email. Telling them my situation. They told me to do this one task, and which I did. And sent them that task and waited, and waited, and waited. I waited for maybe a month or two. And they didn‚Äôt respond to me. No ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, no ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù, not even telling me if I did the task right or not.

I got the app weeks after it launch so I can say with a full heart how much Meta / Facebook has ruined this application. Before it was about artist, photographers and adventure seekers learning from one another and inspiring one another . Now, it‚Äôs advertisement after dual advertisement and that‚Äôs just the influencers. I recommend anyone not to get this application because before the pandemic - you can delete the application than ad it with no problem. Now it‚Äôs nearly impossible to delete the app because of their new programming. Facebook made it nearly impossible to delete, edit the settings or protest against unfair treatment. The number of minority or People of Color creative‚Äôs getting the same attention as white is nearly impossible. Asian hate as increased because of this app as well as death threats, businesses , and sexism. Don‚Äôt get this application - if you have death threats set against you they will not do anything about it. Same with sexism, hate speech or political commentary against  Facebook. Documentaries and Essays have also been written that their children content has been connected to self harm - when asked Meta did nothing .

First of all, reels. I wouldn‚Äôt mind reels as much if they had their own dedicated tab off to the side, but I don‚Äôt like the fact that I heard on the explore page. I can‚Äôt even look at memes around other people anymore without a stupid stripper appearing on my screen. You guys should really start blocking posts like that from showing up, there are little kids who go on this app. I get why you guys created reels, but they should not be in the explore page if they‚Äôre in the app. It makes scrolling through memes VERY uncomfortable. Also, I like how Instagram used to tell me when I‚Äôve seen all my followers‚Äô posts for the past two days. However, I do NOT like that I have to manually select an option in order to view older posts. It makes it a lot harder to find something funny I‚Äôve seen earlier, or like a friend‚Äôs photo that I saw earlier put scrolled past. It‚Äôs a lot more useful than just having a bunch of random posts from accounts I‚Äôm not going to follow below the stuff on my feed.

The snap scrolling is also horrendous. There is no purpose for it outside of browsing the Reels feed. It‚Äôs jarring and clunky when viewing your regular feed of both photos and videos. It‚Äôs just worse tiktok. 

The only thing y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt stolen from tiktok is probably the one thing you should, which is having two distinct feeds for who you follow vs recommended content. I know you can tap the logo at the top of your feed to switch to following vs suggested, but it‚Äôs so intentionally hidden that 90% of Instagram users don‚Äôt even know they can‚Äôt do that and just end up stuck forever in the suggested feed never seeing their friends posts.
