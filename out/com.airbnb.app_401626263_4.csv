10950135607,Thisguyfaub,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id277021547,24.07,1,Horrible,"This company sides with a host that breaks privacy rules by attempting to enter a home, unannounced, with my wife and young son alone in the house. The hosts husband tried to enter without any notice and scared my wife half to death. All she knew was that she was alone and some large man was trying to come into the house. Then Air BnB sides with the host and suspends our account because of lies that the host told Air BnB. No disciplinary actions were taken against the hosts, even though on Air Bnb’s site it clearly states that hosts shall not enter during a stay without prior notice and consent. Fortunately my wife had the chain locked on the door as well, so after the man saw her scared inside the house and still put in the door code to unlock the deadbolt, when he opened the door the chain stopped it after a few inches. My wife fully believes that the man did not have good intentions because of circumstances surrounding this occurrence and his actions and mannerisms. So essentially, Air Bnb promotes rape and abduction. They are just fine with a hosts sketchy husband being a creep and trying to force his way into a house with a young lady and her son by themselves. It was a pathetic and unjust response to a host breaking rules, putting himself and my wife at risk. She could’ve done something to defend herself and hurt him.. or he could’ve taken her and my son and disappeared. Human trafficking is a real thing. I will absolutely not be using Air BnB ever again and I strongly recommend anyone else thinking about using this service to think twice and exercise great caution.

I booked a home in Florida for a full month stay back in July 2023. Now that we are only 3 weeks out from traveling, the host randomly sends me a change date request out of the blue with no explanation to push our trip out three months. I respond to the host asking if this was an error because I was so confused by the request. She replied back that my dates are no longer available and she wants to change them. I declined the change request and let her know that everything had already been planned long ago. We are traveling with a three year old child, and already have all of our flights booked and travel arrangements made. She replies again, and says that the dates are no longer available. She then sends me three additional change date request that are again pushing our dates out three months. I declined all of the change request. She also texted me on my personal phone and told me that the dates are no longer available and that I can cancel on my end. If I do not want to come on the new dates. She is clearly trying to avoid the Airbnb penalty by changing my dates and trying to get me to cancel so that she doesn’t have to cancel. Throughout this whole ordeal, I have reached out to Airbnb customer service six times now each time the agent assures me that this will be handled, and that they will reach out to the host and give them a deadline to reply. After not receiving an update for sometime I call back to Airbnb customer service to try to get an update, and I am told the exact same thing. They say again that they will reach out to the host because they haven’t heard back yet and they will give them a deadline. While the host is not responding to Airbnb, she is messaging me and trying to change my trip or get me to cancel to avoid the penalty. I am shocked that this has not been resolved yet by Airbnb. My family is in a holding pattern while Airbnb continues to reach out to a non responsive host and give them more and more time. The first Airbnb agent I spoke to assured me that this would be resolved within 24 hours and that Airbnb would help me find a new place to rebook. This was 4 days ago. I called AGAIN this morning and asked for a manager. The agent told me the same, they would reach out to the host and give a deadline. I requested a manager again and they said a manager would call me sometime today. I am not confident that will happen and I want a resolution today. This is a nightmare situation after we have everything planned and scheduled for so long and now at the last minute we are told we have no place to stay but the host will not officially cancel. On top of this, the host has now changed the listing from a whole house to a shared one bedroom with no bathroom. This is beyond upsetting and frustrating and Airbnb has majorly dropped the ball on protecting the guest and making things right for us.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-16T08:50:40-07:00

She offered an early checking and accepted for an extra charge of 50$ that I sent electronically.
 She changed the room I was supposed to stay in and gave me one that smelled like cigarette smoke and was unclean. The shower smelled of urine and there was dust everywhere. 
There was a lamp that was catching fire because it was placed next to heater. The restroom lightbulbs were all burnt out. She made it seem like she had no clue of the ongoing issues. She offered me a different room (still not the one on that I had originally requested & reserved) that required me to climb 4 floors of stairs. Keep in mind that I have asthma and bad knees.
The unit she offered had a brick wall & the unit she provided dose not have a brick wall and looks completely different. The rooms smell of mold and her response was to open a window to let the cigarette smoke out. She also stated if I gave her a day she could make the room up to date. I paid 30 nights for 2295$ & the room was not worth it all. she is dishonest about what you’re getting. She mentioned the original room I requested was not in service but was on the app because it was available. I don’t even understand how that is allowed in the app. If a room is out of service it should mean it’s unavailable. Just because you own several rooms in an apartment building doesn’t mean all rooms are the same.

Within the hour of my last payment, my reservation was cancelled (in January). Host says it was canceled by Airbnb and Airbnb support can’t tell me anything, literally nothing! I’m lucky it was cancelled so early so I can change my plans, but my problem is Airbnb isn’t processing my refund. I didn’t cancel it and the booking cites cancellations can be made up to the month before. Regardless, I didn’t cancel it, so the refund should be processed automatically, right? Nope. They should be able to at least tell me what happened, right? Nope. Bottom line is Airbnb support is a total scam they know nothing and can’t explain something as simple as this. They waste time and play tricks with callers needing help by resetting cases, closing cases before resolution and generally not providing any actual support. Escalation doesn’t exist.

We just got here and the address shown on the Airbnb was not the actual address at all. We were misled on purpose, and feel scammed. The Airbnb was not even in the city limits! We were so far that the taxi didn’t know how to get here and had to call the host, the driver wouldn’t even drop us off in front of the apartment building. He stopped in the middle of the road because he didn’t want to go up a little hill on a random street. 

We have no where else to stay, it’s carnival and everything is literally sold out. We’re trying to make it work but all our plans were centered on the now wrong location, we have no transportation and Airbnb support has not been responsive to our concerns.

10915272309,Axemangt,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id509153695,24.06,1,Poor quality search engine and horrible cancellation policies,"So I have had a lot of horrible experiences with airbnb over the past few years and todays events are the final straw. So I attempted 4 different times to book a 2 night stay and each time the hosts asked me to withdraw because they didn’t have updated schedules loaded. So clearly this is stressful by itself. Well I tried a 5th time and this is where the app failed. My search was pretty simple I basically just filtered out extremely expensive places and anything less than 2 bedrooms. Well I found another acceptable place (I thought) I booked and wow it went through. I was on a road trip and got back 3 days later and was showing the bookings to my friends going and realized it was a 1br so I cancelled right away. I was only refunded 2/3 of my money. This was about 3-4 days after the booking and over 6 weeks before the trip. Basically they have horrible policies and a broken search engine. Overall the company shows it doesn’t care for us by not openly showing the “cleaning fees” (turns out they don’t take a percentage of that fee, that’s why all the hosts have MASSIVE cleaning fees) you only see them when you go to check out and find out the cleaning fees are frequently the same cost as the nights stay and in some cases 2-3times that. The least the company could do is average that into the nightly costs. I highly suggest you find a different app to book through.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-08T01:15:42-07:00
