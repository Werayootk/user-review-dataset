10957835371,Adamwritesreview,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id159685684,24.07,3,Good and Bad,"A couple general things I’ve noticed: 

-There are lots of commercial rental properties that rent on ABnB. The app still describes all listings as “you’ll be staying in someone’s home….” Which is definitely not true. 

-The prices used to be good enough to book an Airbnb over a hotel 100% of the time. Now it’s more like 50/50.

-I’m finding that most listings charge a (usually significant) cleaning fee -AND- ask you to do the dishes, take out the trash, etc.

I still book through Air BnB periodically and the app experience itself is pretty trouble free, but the whole experience has become less pleasant over time.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-19T14:48:27-07:00
