I used to not use LinkedIn as much as I do now. Thanks to you for providing us with so many new features that are being added. This is how a real social network should have always been.

The reason for 1 star is:
I am an ardent follower of the daily rundowns. But, I wouldn‚Äôt read all the content in a single go. Instead, I take multiple turns throughout the day to read all of it. Here‚Äôs the problem. 

When I open LinkedIn and say, read two paragraphs and went on to read an email and then do my chores and then come back to LinkedIn after, say, an hour, to pick up where I left off. This is where LinkedIn redirects me to its home page. No, I didn‚Äôt close the app, it‚Äôs running in the background. I would love to continue with the content where I left it off earlier. 

I have seen no other app does this except LinkedIn.

TL;DR I want LinkedIn to show me the content where I left off earlier than always redirecting me to homepage.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-09T20:17:30-07:00

The interface as you can see above wastes 60% of available space with grey useless sidebars.  The chat interface uses 100% the phone buttons, and even the floating keyboard from Apple covers the send or attachement buttons all the time.   Sending a reply and taping a tiny 16x16 px button that‚Äôs millimeters from the expand button and edge is horrific.    Being unable to enlarge the conversation and fill the interface window is just inexcusable.  Do better.
