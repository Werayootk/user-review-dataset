App Integration: Enables connection with other apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, etc., for easy scheduling and joining of meetings.

Polls and Surveys: Facilitates the creation and launching of polls and surveys during meetings for interactive feedback.
Screen Sharing: Allows sharing of the screen or a specific window with participants.
Chat and Reactions: Offers chat messaging and the use of emojis and gestures for reactions.

11019186957,Mikkäel,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id486480384,5.23.2,1,Needs a lot of improvement. This is an embarrassment,"Specifically for VisionOS, though I have various complaints for the desktop version as well.

I have a daily meeting with my team that is convenient to take on my VisionPro. Without fail, I have to force quit the app and rejoin the meeting in order for people to hear me. All other standard troubleshooting does not work. (Leaving meeting and rejoining, closing the app and re-launching, manually toggling mute button). Very annoying.

The tabs on the left seem to have a hard time updating on their own unless I look at the app and manually check through them. This makes it useless to have the app open where I can glance and see if I have new messages or new activity since I can never trust that it’s up to date. I have to make the app active and cycle through them. Beyond any annoyance level, this severely cripples the usability of the app as a standalone app, and makes it more of a nice gimmicky extension to running the app on another device.

Another app breaking thing is that some of the containers seem to have a defined minimum size, which is fair enough, lots of apps do that. However, the developers failed to take this into account when setting limits on the app window itself. you can easily make that app too narrow or too short to be able to see all the controls, for example the text input box to reply to messages. So unless you leave the app at the standard size it is when it launches, or make it huge; you are left to play this guessing game when resizing the window and hoping that you’ve allowed room for everything, which you won’t know until you actually need the thing.

If this was some Indy app that was really cheap, or better yet free; these sorts of things one could live with hoping they are eventually fixed. However given that it’s a paid app from a TRILLION dollar company that I am forced to use for work, these sorts of things, especially aggregated all together are unforgivable. And yes, I realize the app itself is free, but you or an employer ends up paying for your account in some vast majority if not all use cases.

I waited to write a review hoping for a day one patch, then a week one or two, but it is coming up on a month since launch.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-07T12:00:02-07:00
