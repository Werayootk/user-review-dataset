I have been using TEAMS with my AirPods for a while now and its been great. After updating my iPad to 16.4, now when i am in a meeting and i remove my AirPods from my ear, my meeting does not switch to the speaker and microphone of the iPad. In the meeting it shows that the speaker and microphone from the iPad is active but I can’t hear anything and others can’t hear me. The annoying part is that as soon as i try to turn the microphone on/off or even go back to reconnect the AirPods, my meeting just glitches and  drops/disconnects. I tried to “forget my AirPods” and reconnect them and that didn’t help. I uninstalled TEAMS and then re-installed, that didn’t help either. The biggest issue is that if i am in a meeting and my AirPods run out of battery, it will try to connect to the speaker and microphone of the iPad, but once its in that state, it always glitch and drop the meeting no matter what i do. The only way i can now use my AirPods is to connect them prior to joining a meeting but if i am in a meeting and take them off or the battery dies, the meeting glitches and drops/disconnects. I have tested this for a couple of days and the issue is consistent and my TEAMS meeting will always abruptly drop/disconnect. Please help.

Sharing links and media from other apps just sits and spins “Checking your organization policies…” and I have to quit Safari and try again multiple times. Notifications are buggy and don’t notify when you set the desktop availability setting but then walk away for an hour. Can’t join a meeting from the calendar and select which account you want to use. Can’t pin messages in chat. Notification icons show red but there are no notifications after switching accounts. Viewing a shared screen on a call does not allow total full screen on iPad. Whiteboard integration creates a totally new whiteboard outside of the meeting if you want a new page. Can’t search across accounts for meeting invites. Scrolling back in messages constantly bugs out and you go back to the current message. Can’t use DMTF tones when on a Teams call and you call out with PSTN.

So I’m using it weather I want to or not. I like teams for collaborative work on documents, we don’t have to each edit our own copies and then try to merge all the copies together somehow, we can all work on the original document together. 
The chat function is fine except you cannot delete chats, you can only hide and mute them. So every chat group I have ever been in is still there just muted and hidden. There is no way to clear chats or teams. Whatever has been written will stay there forever unless everyone in the chat/team/channel deletes each and every post or comment they made. The same goes for activity. I have thousands of notifications in the activity tab that cannot be deleted. 
It makes the app feel very cluttered all the time. WhatsApp is way better in my opinion for chatting but of course the company wants better privacy than WhatsApp so now all our communication must go through Teams.  
Another problem I have encountered is using the calendar  in teams, it doesn’t link up with outlook calendars very well, sometimes at all. So when we need to schedule a team call, I have to exit teams, check outlook calendars and then go back to teams. 
Anyway, there are some good things about teams but it could be so much better if they made some functionality improvements. I don’t have much hope that much will change however, making the user experience better isn’t a cornerstone of Microsoft.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2022-06-19T02:23:43-07:00

I’ve seen other people post that they have the same issue but that glitch has been there for months and Microsoft hasn’t fixed it yet. For an industry giant like Microsoft, that’s unacceptable.

In particular, remote meetings capabilities, including chat, desktop share, audio, all work well within our corporate network. Also, client-based app and web-based app have essentially the same functionality and look-and-feel, which is definitely preferred. iPhone-based mobile app works well so far. Very good compliment to the main Teams usage on my corporate Microsoft Surface Pro.

Criticism: I was never a fan of the Sharepoint-based file presentation and interface. Windows Explorer in details mode using libraries, shortcuts, etc. is preferred for file management. Maybe Sharepoint file presentation is needed for tablet devices. I’m a longtime laptop point-click user.

Also, in meetings, it was not obvious how to re-display the control bar (enable mute, for example) once the control bar disappeared automatically. I learned how eventually, but guidance on such important items should be more prominent.

The iPad OS feature where the mouse icon snaps onto a button or text field remains completely broken in this app. When you try to mouse over the text entry field to respond to a message the mouse icon refused to snap into the text field leading to frustrating behavior where the mouse will snap to some other location. I haven’t seen this in any other application. In reality, the mouse does appear to “enter” the text field because if you place it just right. However the mouse icon remains at the edge of the text field. This also makes it impossible to place your mouse in a particular place in you message to edit. I had been waiting to see if this behavior is corrected but surprisingly this is still an issue. Does anyone at MS test this app with an iPad and mouse? I can’t see how this is missed because it is so central to the teams use case. Also, this app still does not support multiple instantiations, so there isn’t a way to see your meeting and at the same time respond to messages outside of the meeting.

 It’s not the best calendar app (Google’s is much better and easier to share with others), it’s not the best video chat app (Zoom is and will be the industry leader, at least until maybe Microsoft buys them out and buries them as they did with Skype), it’s not the best messaging app (Jabber or even wonky Slack are far better). It does do a fair job of integrating all these functions, but at a price. Teams really bogs down your system. For me, it’s at a point where I just never leave teams up and running. I only open it when someone else insists on having a Teams meeting. And it doesn’t play nice with other manufacturers’ email software such as Google or Yahoo Mail. The whole point of Teams is to force you to use Microsoft’s other products.

I also have concerns over privacy issues with Teams and Microsoft products in general. Teams has all sorts of nifty analytics on user behavior it can run for the owners of Teams software (i.e. the companies you work for). Unfortunately, as long as Microsoft continues to have corporate America in its back pocket, I don’t see any end in sight for this product soon.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2021-04-14T10:32:02-07:00

And then I have to try and re-open the link another 3-7 times before it will work. And sometimes even after the video call opens, the chat will not open, so then after waiting for it to hopefully pop up, I’ll have to close the app and try another 3-7 to 10 times to get back in again.

1. Allow to have a chat and a hosted file open at the same time. For example, currently, when I work in an Excel file in Teams window (w/o opening it in the native application), I cannot view chats. It’s either or and i need to swap between them (or I have to close the file to view a chat and then re-open the file again). I have multiple computer monitors in my setup, but that does not help. 
Also, sometimes the sync for a file opened in its native application (mostly Excel) fails. This is why I prefer to work in Teams as I always work with others and we need to see each others changes in real time.  I had many problems with this, subject to Microsoft support tickets. The problem continues for me and others in my company. The sync is not fully reliable. 
2. Make the camera background options part of the Settings menu. Most of the time, I cannot find this setup. 
3. Add group call reactions similar to Zoom to let participants of conference calls vote and use the check mark emoji to signal completed tasks (very handy for training calls). 
4. I can no longer answer Teams calls on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I have the latest iOS version, but I am not even getting calls any more.

Third, add a timer for the messages to get deleted! Like after 3 days the post/message has been there then it gets deleted. This would be good so there’s not a bunch of messages/posts every where.

Needs a few things to be perfect!,"Teams has been an excellent communication tool as all coworkers are working remote now. Very easy to collaborate, create team calls, screen shares, etc. A few updates would be the cherry on top.

1. As a creative team we are always dropping files into the chat function to share progress shots, inspiration images and comps. I, and a lot of my team uses the same file naming structure for these images - so there are multiple files with the same name. Teams will not let you upload 2 files with the same name without a pop up window asking if you want to keep both files...and if I click yes it renames them xxxxxx(1), xxxxxx(2) and so on. Please make it so it either let’s me keep both files with the same name without asking or renames them automatically without asking. 

2. When an audio call comes in via Teams it only shows the person initiating the call. If John Doe is calling through a multi-user group it only shows up as John Doe making team calls vs a single user call indistinguishable. A “John Doe via Project xxxxxx Group” would be all it needs.

3. More customizability within chat groups. We use chat groups 99% of the time vs broader team group windows. Would be nice to be able to change sounds, chat group avatar, background image, etc. 

Other than that love the app and it’s integration into Outlook calendar and contacts!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-27T14:05:18-07:00

But not all is hopeless! The service simply needs a handful of features and UI enhancements to improve. In terms of the iOS app, here’s some quick updates:
1. When I get notifications on multiple devices, they should dismiss from all devices once I’ve acknowledged it on any of the devices. Right now when I read something on my phone, the Mac app keeps the badge notifications. The inverse is also true. This is rather annoying.
2. More granular notifications. I don’t want to see a notification for certain channels in a team, even if a channel command is used. The lack of a mute function is unbearable.

More notification stuff. Sometimes the desktop app will keep sending my notifications of chat messages when I'm actively engaged in the chat on that same desktop app. For example: you're in a meeting. Typing in chat.

I’ve turned all notifications off and back on both in the app and in my phone settings. I made sure there are no quiet hours, turned on notifications even when I’m active on desktop, turned on all notification styles in my phone settings, went through each team and chat to turn notifications on, and nothing.

Other than that, there’s sometimes a noticeable lag in getting messages or statuses updating.

No ability to put that your out of office as a status without putting an event in the calendar. How is there not an “off” status?

Edit: no it did not let me in. Microsoft, please fix this, or if there is a way to troubleshoot that would be cool.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2020-10-28T05:27:03-07:00

For our team,  it replaced Skype for Business. It's better than Zoom for presenting PowetPoints (I want to say, ""Duh!"" here, though it's common knowledge that not all Microsoft products play nice with each other). This is true whether you are presenting or watching a presentation.  As a presenter,  you can see your notes on the same screen as your slide, and use a laser pointer to highlight.  You can also write/draw on the slide. I think the coolest presenter feature is the ability to insert yourself,  like a TV meteorologist. 

As an attendee, you can have content presented in high-contrast if you're taking the meeting from the beach. You can also enable captions, when take your meetings at the airport, for example. If the presenter allows, you can move forward and backward through the deck without affecting anyone else. 

The best part of the mobile app is the rainbow theme they call Pride. Most posts and chats are basically monochromatic.  The theme givea you rainbow tools. 

Everything is not rosy. It can be awkward to switch between a presentation and chat. Also there are sufficient differences between the mobile and desktop that sometimes finding what you need tap is challenging.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2022-10-07T18:07:19-07:00

With more complex organizations where generally the information handled is both sensitive and ‘need to know’, the sheer amount of teams, channels, and chat groups to compartmentize information can become overwhelming.  Tack in business portals, support groups,  apps and workflows and the complexity grows.  
The UI need a better way to organize and present these.   The UI also needs to present what’s changing, being posted, and being mentioned better than a dot on an icon, or an activity stream, both of which are dated approaches.
It also needs to suggest best approach when sharing information to reuse existing teams, channels,  sites, chat groups, etc. and to help reduce the sheer number on new things from growing.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-14T16:50:30-07:00
7495325224,JayBoogieWitThaHoodie,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1298452457,3.9.0,1,User experience is extremely stupid,"So first off there is no way to delete chats, so there is unnecessary and very annoying clutter that can't be removed. There isn't even an option to hide a chat despite it saying to do so online. There are no ""three dots"" with more options like it says. Second thing getting on my nerves is how the calendar is only accessible on your personal account, which renders it completely useless for the actual team channel where you'd need to make that information easily accessible to everyone. Same with tasks, also only available for your personal account. There is also no way to add your own personal account into your own business channels. So the features locked behind the personal account version, at that point, could have never been accessed by you or your team anyway.

I don't even understand how you could design an app this frustrating and think that it's okay to make it available for other people. I will be searching for other options now.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-22T19:17:08-07:00

I would also really love to have more features that mirror the desktop app. I can’t initiate using the whiteboard from a video call, but I can participate if someone else starts it. As a teacher, I'd love to use this. It is also really difficult to use video conferencing for teaching because I cant keep the chat open with the video screen at the same time. Please consider adding a pop out where the chat can come up next to the video like the desktop app. 

I also find it difficult that I can only use one note if it launches the app (which also lack features that are available on the desktop version, like the math function) rather than being able to use OneNote directly from teams. 

Lastly, I want to be able to manage my teams from my iPad app because currently some of the manage features are only available on the desktop version. Otherwise, the platform itself isn’t bad and some parts of the app, such as assignments, are exactly the same as the desktop version if I have them side by side to compare. I’m not sure why the app has less functionality than the desktop version, but with so many people using tablets nowadays, especially to teach from, please make them the same with all functionality.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-23T09:55:32-07:00

So, we use Teams (Free) calls mainly to connect which was working fine earlier, however, suddenly, the calls stopped working for some members (within the Teams (Free) personal xyz group) and working for some (within the same Teams (Free) personal xyz group).

When you delete a channel it should delete all data associated with it. Only being allowed to change the privacy setting on a channel during the creation of the channel is inefficient, especially when considering my first grievance. If you mistakenly forget to change the privacy setting upon creation, you are forced to delete the channel, but prior to doing so you’ll need to rename it, so you can use the same name when creating the new channel with appropriate privacy setting.

Suggestion 1: Make it to where a channel is deleted all data associated with the channel is deleted so you can reuse the name.

Suggestion 2: Add the capability to change the privacy setting during any point of the channels lifespan.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2021-08-03T03:56:53-07:00
