I suspect this is a Marketing “feature”, not I don’t appreciate the numerous notifications (badge numbers). I feel like I need to check to see what’s up, but nothing, just feature toasts. Not uncommon to see the number 4 or 5 over the app icon. I go in and look and close the new feature toast, go back out, the the notification number is gone. Why would someone think this is a good idea?",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-28T13:02:20-07:00

Thanks for being awesome, TEAMS!
