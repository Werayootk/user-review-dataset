They took away snapchat games, changed the bitmojis, i have to screen shot my pictures to make it big enough so snap chat doesnt force it to be small, i have to download my picture and use a filter in my camera roll bc the filters will cut off halfway on the picture when i post it normally, i cant even save photo anymore from other people‚Äôs chats because it keeps saying something went wrong (yes i updated, and restarted my phone a bunch of times), and the AI is pretty sketch to me. I really hate this app but its what everyone else uses so im forced to use it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T10:27:37-07:00

In result of this every other week I would try and log in and see if it will allow me to access snapchat but it would stay the same. I‚Äôve tried contacting snapchat, read articles and no help. I left snapchat alone for about 3 months now and now I tried logging in and it said device was banned, again I did not do anything for my device to be banned and I really want snapchat back because of all the memories I had in there. I also cannot make a new account and this is the newest phone I have (iPhone 14) wich I will not be getting a new one so I can have snapchat.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-18T08:21:11-07:00
