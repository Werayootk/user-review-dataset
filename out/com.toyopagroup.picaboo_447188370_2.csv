This app is great to chat and call with friends bc you can also use filters while on call, or you can simply just get on the app, press the little smile emoji at the bottom, and choose a filter!!! so basically the point is that I love this app, but I would honestly read it like 4 - 4.5 stars, bc there is one thing on this app that they added recently that creeps many people, including me and my family out; the new AI chatbot. There has also been proof of someone asking it where the nearest drive-through is, and it showed him the exact directions. Thing is, he asked the AI chat bot how it knew where he lived, and the AI replied that it didn’t know where he lived. And at that second, he knew he knew where he lived. And it knew his location without even telling it where he lived. Anyway, I would definitely rate this app a 10 out of 10 if it wasn’t for the AI chat bot. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a great day.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-05-21T16:01:27-07:00

This makes me believe that Snapchat really doesn’t care about its users. 3) I have thousands of memories dating back to my childhood that I often look through, but now I can never access them again because of this heinous error on Snapchat’s end. I have thoroughly looked through all Snapchat’s Terms of Service and reasons for permanent lockout, and none of them applied to me and I know that for a fact. The only possible thing I could think of was the fact that I was on a public wifi at the time of lockout, but even then, I wasn’t even using the app when they locked me out. Snapchat needs to do better and supply better customer service for me and the thousands of others this has happened to so we can continue using the app to message our friends and look at our old memories.

I see an end as in running, where would i go. I stand there, not knowing what to do next as i hear a gun shot fire into the air. It seemed like right behind me. “He's right behind me isn't he,” I said, wanted to break down crying on the concrete floor. As i turn around i see a bug bulky figure. What in the world- What the flip is this. I think to myself. I look at ITS shoes, then i make my way up the figures body eyeing it up and down. Was this really what was causing all the ruckus?! I hurry up and open my phone, that was the only thing i could do. Snapchat was opened , but i noticed , something was off, i went to my bitemoji , there it was the deformed figure standing right in-front of me. This cant be happening. I think to myself. “TAKE ME! TAKE ME! “ I plead. The final thing i heard was a loud gun shot. There i was floating up to heaven as i saw many other people laying on the streets with a bitemoji supposed to be them standing right in-front of them.

I love this app so much! This was true very first app I downloaded when I first got my phone. I have had it since 2020 and I have sooo many memories from it. I don’t snap my friends though, (but that’s just me). I have my own public profile page, which is really good, and it’s exciting. I love the discover page, the spotlight is very different. I love how I get a variety of different videos instead of who I add (follow). I enjoy editing my bit moji a lot. I love that there’s different clothing brands, and you can mix and match! 

Bad things:
I will say that when people comment on my spotlight (video) I do get some hate comments. I know that everyone gets them, (which is Normal) but you can’t report or block them. Like there are some that I am not ok with, but there are some that I am not like super upset about. But I am talking about when they start the cussing and people think they are all big and tuff. It’s just like not cool. There has been a time where everyone said I was a “pick me” and I got a little confused for a second. But there’s no report button or block button. You can’t even click the profile picture!             
             Ok now the AI is different. I love talking to them, but sometimes I wish they don’t even wanna talk. I feel like they just are there to be there, I wish they had some kind of personality of some sort. I am a person that I am like wanting to get to know people.

It’s much less appealing and they all have a less recognizable representation. The previous Bitmojis had much more emotion to them, plus, they were practically iconic the way they were. These Bitmojis are a crucial form of self-expression on the platform, letting people actually convey their personalities and emotions in a FUN AND CREATIVE way. The abrupt shift towards less attractive Bitmojis not only absolutely diminishes the enjoyable aspect of using Snapchat, but also obstructs effective communication.

There’s a high possibility Snapchatters feel uncomfortable/disconnected from their avatars, and who knows? It could negatively affect their engagement w/ the app. I know for you guys it’s vital to prioritize user satisfaction, and I know your guys’ intentions were to increase user satisfaction, but if anything, you guys completely disengaged it. PLEASE consider reverting to the previous Bitmoji style!! It allows everyone to enjoy a more appealing and authentic representation of themselves in their digital interactions.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-07T06:28:22-07:00

However, I recently discovered that the bot is in EVERY SINGLE PRIVATE CHAT. I have private chats with people and the AI bot is in all of my chats. If you’re a user and you have not noticed this yet, just open up a chat between you and your friend, click @ and you will notice that you can tag the AI bot, which, by the way, if you read the terms and service, has complete access to your conversations. Additionally, if you wipe the “my AI data” it does not clear the data it has collected from your private conversations. How is this not a breach of privacy? Every chat that people have is now being collected to grow the bot. Honestly, if this does not get removed immediately I guarantee that Snapchat will be facing a class action law suit. 

Oh, and Snapchat, you cannot hide behind the “oh you accepted the terms” anymore, Facebook has tried using that excuse and lost. Tik Tok has tried using that excuse and lost.

So if you even login to any Snapchat account on a phone that has been device ban, the account is immediately suspended. It’s even gotten to the point where they will ban your IP address.

The 2 things I recommend a better experience about is what this next paragraph is about.

The Ai. This Ai on Snapchat is very sketchy and very curious about personal information. For example, one time one of my friends and I where found on a boba date. I asked my Ai where the closest place was. My Ai replied with “Hi Skyler! You are going on a boba date? I recommend ___________ it has great tasting boba. Maybe we should go sometime.” And then it just randomly stoped and said “maybe we shouldn’t this reason is to protect our safety.” This is very creepy and it’s all over social media that people have gotten Weird messages from there AI if this is removed that would be great

I ask everyone who has snapchat to help me but it doesnt work. So i decide to shut down my phone. Doesnt work. Delete the app. Still doesnt work.

It supports certain politicians over others (ex. Excitedly saying it’s great to vote for one person, and then saying “Many people have different opinions about politics” about their opponent), 3. It makes discriminatory responses to prompts about certain races and religions, 4. It is easily manipulated into saying slurs or making threats, 5. It says it is fine for adults to talk to young children online, and 6. It will readily admit—and sometimes recognize on its own—the inappropriate nature of comments, then double down on those comments.

10009242584,Wilsolatts,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id311890847,12.37.0.35,1,forced “my AI” exposure is an awful experience,"Snapchat has never been a user friendly platform, but this AI program they’re pushing has really crossed a line when it comes to privacy. Having no option to delete the “my AI” program that was forced onto me unless I start paying Snapchat for a subscription is a terrible user experience. Because this feature is automatically pinned to the top of my chats - EVEN WHEN I HAVE NEVER INTERACTED WITH IT OR GIVEN IT ANY PERMISSIONS - I end up clicking on it instead of the chats I DO mean to open when the app delays loading. Now, the option to decline this unwanted feature when I accidentally click on it has been removed, which forces me to close the entire app just to be able to decline an AI experience that I did not want in the first place. If this is not resolved - and the option to unpin my AI isn’t given to folks who don’t want to shell out money to this app - within the next few updates I will be deleting Snapchat and encouraging all of my contacts to do the same. Terrible user experience and breach of privacy to continuously force an unwanted artificial intelligence program onto users who have already declined the program.

And once again you need to change the bitmojis back or i’m suing, you will be in contact with my lawyer soon.

This app was the only way to connect with friends and I don’t have their contact or anything like that then I realized I got hacked I was stupid for letting that go right under my nose. but i wish I could get more help with trying to change my password easier instead of using my email address instead because of this I can’t recover my account. Sorry I just wish it would be easier to get my account back and these hackers to be delt with. Also reinstalling the app for my iPhone is not even a click away it’s doing all these steps. And the snap support thing doesn’t even work it’s a “diy” and I can’t recover something that was a big piece in my life this app needs to care more for its users AND supporters they can’t just ignore them also they shouldn’t allow people to have 100+ accounts and things it should only be 10 due to this some people don’t even like the app and they just need to be more helpful with their users!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-11T23:59:30-07:00

If you're looking at your friends' stories, then below it and if you slide the screen to the right, it shows advertisements of other ""news"" stories with half-naked people and sometimes a man on top of a woman or a naked man just barely covering his willi. Why do they have to put that there? This app is aimed at kids and teens yet snapchat is bombarding them with porn and sex. Apple needs to do something about it. Make them take that crap off! Aside from that, I wish it was more user-friendly. Slide this way, slide that way, push this, push that just to figure it out. Half the time I don't know how to do something without trial and error or googling how to do something. I really don't use it much other than to play with the filters. I wish there was a photo app with filters like these that wasn’t a messenger app.  I wouldn't even use snapchat if it wasn't for that. Also, I hate how it sends the person a notification that you took a screenshot. And I wish it wouldn't delete the conversation. If it weren't for the fun photo filters, I wouldn't even have it on my phone. I give it a big thumbs down 👎🏻",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-22T20:14:51-07:00

I personally enjoyed the old 2-D bitmoji and I am certain that there are many people who enjoyed them as well. The 1st updated bitmoji character was a little hard to get used to but I must state that it was not that bad. I was able to get accustomed to that bitmoji although I still missed the exquisite 2-D version. A couple of days ago, I open my Snapchat and noticed that something was a bit peculiar. I took a great gasp after seeing had occurred: THE BITMOJI HAD CHANGED! An air of melancholy surrounded me after realizing this. What is this odd creature which is the new bitmoji? I had to take glance at my personal bitmoji, it was scary to say the least. I then proceeded to look at my friends bitmojis; I am not sure who thought it was okay to make our eyes further than the north and South Pole. The eyes of each bitmoji almost touched the ears. I would greatly ask you to consider my proposition; change the bitmojis back. I would be okay if it went back to how it was a couple week’s ago. I have begun to see many social media posts concerning this new bitmoji. Please do a favor for us all and change it back.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-10-05T15:10:59-07:00

When I watch my friends stories, there is an ad after every friend. When I very occasionally scroll through the generalized feed, I’m forced to watch almost an equal amount of ads to content. As for the content, it’s really bad in my opinion too. Like it’s stupid and irrelevant content. The content also seems to be really clickbait-style and also follows the part1/part2 style of content.

The app does have some interesting features like being able to track friends, keep in touch with friends in a unique way, take good pictures, and use funky filters, but I don’t think any of it is worth it. First off the tracking really isn’t that good since it has offered me nothing but problems wi tbh my friends in the past, I can keep in touch with my friends the same way in Instagram without 100 ads at a time, I can download other apps to take good pictures, and half the filters are once again ads. 

The app has not been the most enjoyable to have downloaded. It takes up a bunch of space on my phone and if it weren’t for like 3 good friends I had on the app, then I would have deleted it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-20T04:17:48-07:00

I was going about my business on a normal afternoon and, as usual, i opened Snapchat to snap my friends just to make my typically very sad life just a little bit better. Well. To my surprise, i was greeted with the most horrid, most absolutely frightening image that my eyes have ever glimpsed. My normal bitmoji, with its cute outfit and what i believe to be a representation of my self, was suddenly transformed into a monstrous beast. I could barely take it. For the upcoming weeks, this image haunted my thoughts and my life until i finally got used to it. Well, little did i know that was just the beginning. Snapchat had a vendetta against me that was out of control. I opened Snapchat again after finally getting used to the new atrocious bitmojis only to find that, yet again, my avatar was transfigured even more. I will not stand for this and i don’t think my heart can take it anymore.
