They just had there 10 year birthday and I was like holy crap because I have been playing for 5 years and the fact that it’s been out for ten I was just surprise but happy belated birthday. This game is a very big success and the only thing I can say is that we all don’t like ads but the good thing is that they have very few and you can get something like 600 coins for 1 ad (example) and hey that’s pretty good because some games you need to watch 5 ads so hey.

I love how you make these cool characters and you just thought out of the box you made them have different outfits which I think is really cool. But I do have some requests for the games but not demands. First off please make the promo codes to iOS because I have an iPad and I can’t put in promo codes which is disappointing. Second please make all the stuff free you don’t have to do it but suggestion.

I mean now everything is organized like with the character organization of alphabetical, default or owned. And new colors. But I have some ideas and improvements. To begin with, for the characters you should include a little blurb about them. Also, I don’t have facebook but I really want to have the account so you should let everyone do it even if they don’t have an account. And how come whenever one of the seasons ends you make everyone wait another day to see the new season. Why not just do it right away? And can you not make people wait another 24 hours for another stage for the tag time event. Please 🙏 read and try to make these ideas happen. And one more thing.

I absolutely love this game and it’s fun and addictive for me (in a good way) but there’s something about this game that I want you to know. It’s that all the items/important stuff: keys, characters, (etc) are hard to get.? . By that I mean like... the characters; as soon as you get further into the game you need a kind of excessive amount of that character’s item and with the keys; I know it’s kind of supposed to be the difficulty of the game but I don’t really like the way that the amount of keys that you need to revive increases every time you die again (after you pay the keys and die again) until you can’t really afford it anymore. I know this may just be the difficulty of the game (again) but it’s just kind of frustrating. Anyways, I love the game and it’s amazing 😉 thanks for listening 😃

I used to own Tasha, Fresh, Lucy ( good i still have her ) and the starting guy ( name I forgot ) and also my hoverboards, I bought the super speed hoverboard (I don’t remember its exact name but i got that ) and about 3 other basic ones now of which I don’t have. And also my high score of 1.4 mil has been reduced to about 48k 🤦‍♀️. I am very disappointed that this game has done this to me,  was a huge fan of this game but now I’m not so sure.

Before my sister moved out she would always let me play this game on her phone. When I got my own phone which was about 3 and a half months ago the first game I wanted was this one. I don’t have any problems with this game. It even allows YOU to CHOOSE if you WANT to. You get to choose if you want to watch an add to double up or get more advantages. Other games make you watch an add and you don’t get anything. If you press the menu or home screen a tiny add will be there but you can press the ‘x’ immediately. You should have this game for the following reasons...!!

1. It’s a very addictive game great for when you want some time AWAY from adds.

2. You can get many different characters and some are for limited time witch gets your heart racing and will make you want to play more. 

3. And in the game as you are running there are quite a few power ups but the game gets faster very quick so the power ups are definitely a handy material. 

Again I’m extremely happy with this game and always have been.  I hope this game stays in app purchases for one of my kids one days so they can play this too.

‼️🚨APP DESIGNER PLEASE READ🚨‼️
I have an  idea for a challenge and it might be hard to develop but it would be fun. 

What if you could race with other players… like you would enter into the “Run Together” challenge and you would run the same track at the same time with other members of the game.
 It would be like one of those car games at an arcade. You could see the other players running with you.
 If you get caught the only way to come back is keys or one video. There are also power ups like normal but each one can only be collected by two people. There are 5 people running at a time. 
There are waiting rooms for races and you can do other challenges or the regular run and you'll get notified when your available to run. You can click the notification and enter your race. 
The winners after 3 races will compete and that winner can win keys or money or a special character/board. Then the races start over.

This might sound like a lot but it would get more people on the game and would just be great in general.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2023-11-10T09:19:55-07:00

Second of all this app is what you would expect, you Run jump and collect characters/boards. To make a long story short I'mma cut to the chase (get it? Subway surfers is a chasing game :)) 
Anyway, the game is fun and it passes time. For me a good game is a game that doesn't have adds and doesn't drain battery now I have a phone that's been passed down through 2 people so it's old. Making it so almost all apps with adds drain my battery yet this app doesn't. Adds only come once and awhile AND when you get prizes for them. Great app highly suggest. 

Now for the creators I have one suggestion. 

Nowadays popular apps are ones that stick with the trends, so I was thinking and I thought that what if you made a character with a special skill, and a board to pair with it. Now what would be the characters theme? Signs, Scorpios, Gemini, Aquarius. A character and a skateboard for each sign. Both only 50,000 coins each? It is affordable and everyone will have their ""sign""! It would be so cool to run away from the police in my style/my sign. Please try and add that to the game 

Other than that TOTALLY GET THIS GAME!

Some games I get bored of before 5 minutes or I get bored in a day but this game keeps me concentrated and keeps me happy I really like the game and I think it’s underrated everybody says that the game is not good but it is. I think more people need to start to play this game more it’s the best Mobile game out there and nothing‘s gonna change my mind about that.

Thank you for your great game.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2022-05-26T16:36:52-07:00

I think this game is amazing and Do Not talk to me if you think it’s trash. I played this game since when I was 6 the only small thing that I didn’t like but I won’t make it a big deal but I think it would be best for a update for your own account so if you delete it by accident then you could easily get all your people and scores that’s all!!

I love the new update of Mexico and finding the purple masks and I love how for every holiday there is an update. I have been playing this game for 4 years now and it never gets boring, it’s always interesting to see new characters that relate to the background of the game for the month. I cannot wait for the next update. I have one note though you guys should probably have more characters instead of focusing on the game updates because everyone liked it better when the original game was on I also think that there should be more girl characters (especially Tom boys) because there are mostly boys and it doesn’t attract that much attention from the girls but I am just telling you guys as a tip but other than that your game is awesome so keep up the good work!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-17T18:23:40-07:00

First of all, I love this game, I have been playing it forever, (but I always spend my keys bc I’m too lazy to restart) here are some suggestions I have; can you make the characters less expensive? I know I sound like I’m complaining, but I’m not. That’s the only thing that I really don’t like, but I don’t have the new update. At least, I think I don’t! I think you should totally but this app if you want to pass time, and it is free and it doesn't need WiFi! I spend hours on this game. Hope you like it as much as I do! There are some minor bugs when I pass the cop, it glitches. But I’m not sure if it’s my internet or not. Overall, I would totally but this app! Have a nice day/night!

Y’all have made everyday better and better for me and the other viewers who agree with me. My iPad broke and when I got a new one the first thing I did was download this game. Truly everyone in the crew has made something better in this game. I would recommend adding new characters that stay in the game.

But the thing is if you have a really good score the week before, IT ALL GOES AWAY THE NEXT WEEK!!! I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that’s all I have to say on the negative side of things. But on the positive side, this game is an amazing pass time if you want to spend some mindless time in quarantine. It is also overall just really fun. So to conclude I do recommend this game

One reason fun to play in the car because you are bored and need something to do. Another reason you can challenge others that are with you to see who can run a father distance or see who can get the most coins. Also in the game you can earn boxes that give you stuff to get new  surfers or characters , get letters while you are in a run and build words that get you stuff, or even just in a run you can run into a box and get stuff out of it when you get out. It tells you your high score after the run you got it on. It keeps track of the high score, the amount of coins you get and earn.

Being able to cancel power ups. 
It’s as easy as a tiny x next to them. Sometimes I’ll be trying to complete a mission, like gold is useless, and with super shoes pick up a magnet. 

It would also be fun if the camera followed the character like when you have double jump, or you could play in first person. 
These could be turned off in settings of course. 

You could add the cop as a playable character. 
That way you could play with your friends and also have a way to win if the cop crashes. But you could also play with the bot if you wanted the endless runner

For those of us without Facebook please make a way for us to play with the people around us, especially if you add the cop. I could play with my little sister who doesn’t have Facebook. 

Also it would be really fun if you had two friends that played together and you could see each other’s characters on your own screens. 

Maybe make a texture pack icon where you can choose to play in previous updates.

There are always new updates, new characters to unlock, new boards to try, and so much more. Now this is still a mobile game so it is pretty straight forward but Subway Surfers just has a certain charm to it. Now I may be wrong but this might the first out of MANY infinite runner games which just makes it even better. If you are ever just bored in a waiting room or car ride you can just pull out that phone and play for a bit. So even when you have a little free time you should play this game. Heck, even if you have tons of free time there is a lot to do, unlock, and collect in this game. The only problem with the game is simply it crashes sometimes.

Some things that are fun about are collecting tokens for the season hunt because it makes the game interesting, I also like the world tours and switching from place to place every time the hunt ends. I like getting a high score too, it makes me feel like I accomplished a hard mission whenever I get a new high score. Even though there are some downsides of the game, like why does Prince K cost 980,000 coins? That’s ridiculous! The logic in the game also kind of doesn’t make sense, like I understand that a magnet attracts coins, but not the super sneakers. Also the cop that chases you when you start the game, how can he catch up to you so fast?he’s mad fat!

So as you know there is like bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and champion. I’m currently the highest person in silver, but every time I run to beat the people in gold, I have to go all the way back to the bronze people and beat them all over again. I don’t think that I should have to do this, because I already beat them so what is the point of me doing it again.

Also, if I run into a train and lose, sometimes the ads won’t work and when I try to use my keys, it also won’t work and I have to get out of the game and get rid of it and go into it again and ruin my hard work.

I also like just buying new avatars for myself when I have emough money. of course there are a couple ads, but absolutely not as worse as some other games like maybe once every 3 hours automatically but subway surfers is a great game.

After that, my attempt at the new Fresh skin came short on the third page after a 2.5M point run followed by a wipe of my progress, and then another wipe of my progress after a 3.9M point run.

The challenges are also really fun and the  game is just amazing 🤩 I usually don’t write reviews but I really like this game and thought I should write a review on it. 

All in all this is a great game but I have one suggestion that I think would help improve the game.  Could the creators add a mission  like “ground is lava”? Where you have to go so long without touching the ground like 30 seconds or something? That would be so much fun. 
Also if anyone who doesn’t like this game like saying it’s dumb or boring, don’t let that stop you from downloading this game. If you don’t like it, delete it. It’s that simple. You don’t have to write a bad review just delete t he game and let it go.

I first got it on my iPad and have been playing it for a while now. I spent my coins on cool characters and stuff and thats where the problem comes in. Firstly, I think you should be able to create an account without Facebook, because some people (including me) are not allowed to have social media so we cant sync our characters between devices if we wanted to. Other than that I love Subway Surfers and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a rewarding game that is fun and challenging at the same time (challenging because of the speeds you can get to!) warning: it could be addictive but if you monitor yourself it is fine. If any parents are reading this, you should definitely let your child get Subway Surfers.

5993767521,Au5ar,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id280090905,2.1.0,1,Bring back the old design,"I used to love playing this game all the time back in 2013. I’d stopped for some time but finally redownloaded it in quarantine. It was quite nostalgic seeing the app virtually the same as how I remembered it in 2013. But this update is an absolute mess. The graphics look so childish, I couldn’t believe how big of a downgrade it was. And to make it worse, the game lags on my iPhone XS Max even though it was fine on the previous update. I really regret not having read reviews but this update’s taught me a valuable lesson that newer is certainly not necessarily better. Please bring back the classic design. Based on the other reviews, it’s fairly clear no one likes this horrendous overhaul. And please fix the lagging, it’s hard to play when the frames glitch out ever other lane change. If you’re a player reading this, DO NOT UPDATE! It’s not worth it by a long shot. Once things are fixed, I’ll give the classic version of the game the five stars it deserves, as opposed to the current garbage.

EDIT: Still haven’t fixed the graphics",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=512939461&type=Purple%20Software,2020-05-25T15:52:48-07:00
