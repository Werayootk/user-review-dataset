10661718473,SoulPatch12,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34619612,9.1.345,3,Fine app but job search needs a lot of help,"Looking for a job is much easier on other apps. 

The biggest issue that I run across constantly is one company posting the same job a million times and LinkedIn thinking I want to see and hear about every single one. They can take up pages of the job search page. 

It’s impossible to block companies or else I would so I would see these jobs. 

If they add the ability to block or hide companies jobs, then it would make this so much better. But as it is now, it’s a frustrating experience.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=288429040&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-05T17:27:56-07:00
