Or a job that says in the title $30-$35 an hour. But then in the description the company says you can make ‚Äúup to $20 an hour‚Äù. Not only does this app not have a way to report these, they ignore your email when you take the extra time to tell them about it.

This was not an issue at all a couple years ago, shortly after Microsoft bought LinkedIn.
