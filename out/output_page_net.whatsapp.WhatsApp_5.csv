I think that WhatsApp should have a function that automatically changes your about according to your location and the time. You should only have to allow permission to the location and fill out some information. For example, say you‚Äôre heading to the gym. On the way, your about will say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm driving‚Äù. When you get there, it says ‚ÄúAt the gym‚Äù. This is a suggestion I have that I believe will make WhatsApp even better than it already is. I hope y‚Äôall take this into consideration.

Worse yet when you try to block the person making these threats, WhatsApp allows them to continue their attacks by letting them create multiple accounts. So it is almost impossible to escape this behavior unless you entirely delete the app. This site is run by amateurs who only care about maintaining as many active accounts as possible even though some of these accounts are criminal enterprises.
