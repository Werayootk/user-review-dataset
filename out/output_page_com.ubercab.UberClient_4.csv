This ride I take very often is a 17$ to 30$ in peak hour ended up costing me 63$ and some change. Customer service claimed that the difference is because of the Starbucks stop!! Ignoring the fact the that Starbucks is on the normal route he should have taken in the first place.

We then explained we wanted to go to the White House where the President of the United States lives.  We had an invitation to tour the White House and needed to be there by 11:10am to make the tour.  She said she would drive faster to get us there before 11:30a. We replied that wasn’t good enough.  She then dropped us off at the wrong location (about 2 blocks past where we should have been dropped off).  After much running we finally made it to the entrance gate around 11:40.  We were the lady to be admitted as they were closing the entrance.  We are definitely NOT happy with our very first experience with Uber and it will be my last.  $18 plus for purposely driving to the wrong location to increase the price is unacceptable!!!! Thankfully the Secret Service staff was kind enough to let us through.

I used Uber while on vacation over a few days. The drivers themselves were courteous and professional, the problem was with the ride selection system and their near non-existent customer service.
On multiple occasions, the system selected drivers for me who already had passengers. I watched on the GPS as the driver drove 15 minutes in the other direction, leaving waiting on the corner for over 30 minutes. Of course if you cancel and attempt to get another driver, you are hit with a $5 fee for “wasting the driver’s time”.
On another occasion, the driver showed up but told me he couldn’t make the trip and that I had to cancel, costing me $5. After I contested the fee on the app, they “refunded” the fee, but only in the form of credit on the app. I had no intention on ever using Uber again at that point, so I attempted calling a customer hotline to get a real refund. It doesn’t exist. There is only an automated phone line that directs you to use the app for assistance, and the app only offers an FAQ and very specific automated help. Apparently there is a actual hotline, but it is only for customers who pay extra for Uber Premium. Forget that, I’ll just take the $5 loss and switch to their competition from here on out.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-03-06T10:54:37-07:00

Initially I was quoted $92. I was charged wait time! After I waited for 15 minutes for driver to arrive. He pulled up and stopped 25 yards from where Iwas standing. I couldn’t possibly read his plate and there were 5 or so cars between us stopped as his car was still not to curb. There were no cars at curb in front of me and outside lane was open except for him blocking it, and I was standing waving my arms, It took maybe 2 minutes to roll our bags down to where he stopped half blocking the out side lane as he waited for cars at curb to move. I was amazed I was charged a “wait time” fee as. I had hustled down to his stop point.  I had initiated tracking not sure why he stopped short but I guess GPS can do that. If I knew I had been charged a lousy wait fee I wouldn’t have tipped him $15   
$120 was $20 higher than a limo I took a few months ago. Really bad experience for the rate hike. No tolls or anything I was aware of, Driver was friendly and good driver unless he had something to do with wait fee! No way did he have to wait! I may try lift next time.

I often opted for the cheaper Uber pool option. During a recent visit to NYC I realized the Uber pool option now requires users to walk a short distance. In theory, I have no issue with walking to get the cheaper rate, and I can see how it would be more efficient in cases where streets are one way and whatnot.  However, the GPS doesn’t orient you and the pickup location is confusing. I would walk to a location only to see the driver would be at another location, calling me and asking where I am. The map doesn’t orient itself according to the direction you are facing, adding more confusion.  This means I spent more time stressfully communicating with my driver before I’m even in the vehicle just to find them, and if that doesn’t work, you’re out of luck and have to pay a $5 fine. Fix the GPS for walking. It should orient to the direction I’m going, at least. Otherwise, offer a door to door pickup with Uber pool like it used to be. I’m not going to pay $15 for an X when I can get the same trip for $5, but I also don’t think myself as the customer or my driver should have to deal with a poor gps walking system implemented by Uber.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-12-05T21:46:00-07:00

Just recently I decided to go ahead and give them another go and I am very happy that I did!!! The first thing I noticed is the prices for rides were significantly cheaper as I have been constantly comparing the two before traveling from one destination to the other. The other aspect that’s HUGE for me when it comes to ride-share is the fact that I am able to get a ride sent to my location in less than 10 minutes compared to waiting anywhere from 10-25 minutes with the other guys in most cases. Now keep in mind with the competition you receive a lower rate when you choose to wait longer on a ride and even then Uber still comes out to a lower fare without the terrible wait time, so with all that being said I have to say that Uber is definitely the way to go in my opinion if you are looking for better pricing and quicker pickup times 👍🏼",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-11-24T04:37:05-07:00

I paid $400 for a flight change due to a cancellation of a scheduled Uber ride in Doha, Qatar. I asked to speak with a manager at Uber multiple times, but the customer service reps refused and said they can’t help with this issue. 

I scheduled a trip to the airport and the Uber driver canceled it 10 minutes before the pickup time. I requested another Uber trip and it took a half hour to come to my place. The trip was in the early morning, I wanted to get to the airport before the rush hour. Cancellation of the first Uber trip meant a half hour delay plus the traffic of the rush hour. So instead of arriving 2 hours and half before the take off, I arrived at the airport one  hour and 10 minutes before the take off which was late. So, my flight got delayed for one day and I had to pay for a fight change and one night hotel room. 

Irresponsible treatment from Uber and Uber drivers. Why Uber doesn’t investigate such issues and at least give warnings to the irresponsible drivers. The driver knew that the time was critical because of the time and the road constructions.  Why did he accept the request if he was going to cancel it 20 minutes after accepting the scheduled trip?

I open the app today and it’s asking me to rate my ride with a driver I never even rode with. I gave the driver 1 star in hopes that it would give me a prompt to explain WHY I decided to give him one star. And the option “Driver never showed up” or anything along those lines was non existent.

So now I have to pay an exorbitant price because of some random generated number that is produced by this algorithm and then you have the audacity to ask me to tip the driver when you know that this company is capable of paying their drivers more. So now you have a strained driver/passenger relationship because they are trying to get somewhere in a timely manner but they are annoyed because that is prevented due to software. I live in DC.

Uber doesn’t do much on your behalf for this. They may attempt to find another driver, but that doesn’t help the fact that you may be late to work or something.

I’ve tried on multiple occasions across that time to ask why it happened and if I can get it back, but the most I heard was a few weeks ago with them saying it was pending an investigation. Never told what about just that a representative would reach out, which as of my writing this has still not happened, and that they’d try to quickly resolve it if they could. Mind you each time I tried to reach out I had to start the entire process from the beginning which just made it all the more frustrating that nobody could reach back out to tell me anything, even if I couldn’t get that account back any information would be fine. I’m done with the app altogether now though after this latest attempt and deleted the app and Uber eats as well, cause even when they did work the constant overcharging and price changes days after the fact made the apps more hassle to use than convenient like it should be. I’m not one to even do reviews for anything but this is probably the only way I’ll get an actual response from someone at Uber.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-08-27T16:36:09-07:00

I order a 40$ meal from my favorite restaurant at 3pm for dinner I get a notification of a 40min delivery. This is common. But my delivery man didn’t get here till 6PM!! After I bought a 3$ priority delivery.. I get the notifications that my food was delivered I run down stars to no food to be seen… I check my neighbors houses to see if it was a accident but when I checked nothing I open my doorbell camera to see what happened ( your not going to believe this) the delivery man rolls through my neighborhood without stopping pushes deliver and drives off with my food. I spam call customer service in outrage and keep getting “servers down sorry for inconvenience” FOR 3 days to finally getting a response today saying that they can’t help because it’s past 48hrs. With video proof and even screenshots of customer service, I’ll never use this application again, there was also no way to ever contact the delivery man or even leave a review… I COULDNT EVEN GIVE HIM ONE STAR!!!!

I will say that they have cheaper prices if you book ahead which I like over Lyft. The biggest issue that I’ve been running into is that most times when you book far ahead then the driver has the liberty to cancel last minute. The driver being able to cancel so late in the booking has made me late for work on multiple occasions. Normally, If it were anything other than my livelihood it wouldn’t be such a big deal. I’ve consistently had this happen, then I’ve got to wait for another driver to pick up the booking and make their way to me. I’ve had Uber drivers come to pick me up drunk, mask-less, and some of them plainly just talk too much. Some get too personal, too fast. Some linger a little too long when they realize I live alone. I’ve had one stop his car and just stare while I was walking my dog, post trip. It’s scary, and it is an unsafe feeling I get from using Uber a lot of the time BUT it’s something that I need to do. Uber has to do better about getting their drivers, the quality of safety should have some reviewing, and the consistency of the booking ahead of time should be reviewed and adjusted.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-05T10:12:05-07:00

In order to pay up for his debts, he had to go back looking for a job. He couldn’t find any due to his language barrier.  His last resort was to use his car for Uber in order to bit by bit pay off what he owes. 

Things were going good for a while until just a few days ago where he was falsely accused of sexual harassment by a rider. Uber took no attempts in investigating the situation and immediately locked his account. Mind you he had a 4.7 or above rating for his rides, but instead of Uber looking into it or contacting any previous clients, they immediately cut him off. The woman was a larger size, and she forced my dad to wait outside for almost 30 or so minutes, which cost her extra. In a lazy and underhanded attempt to get her money back, she took advantage of the fact that my dad didn’t have a camera in his car and accused my dad of sexual harassment and force Uber to refund her money. This in turn locked him out of his Uber account ended his only source of income that he could find, and further pushed him down a rabbit hole of debt that’s almost impossible to climb out of. I’m very angry at Uber for displaying this little care in a situation and offering my dad no due process.

After having two short flights over the lake cancelled on me, and having exhausted all the usual possibilities for getting me from O’Hare to my family’s home on the other side of Lake Michigan, I turned to Uber for the roughly 4 hour drive. (Don’t judge me. I’m overloaded.)
Three drivers responded, but the first car I recognized was Gbenga’s, and even after he realized the length of the drive we were about to undertake, we headed out into the heavy Chicago traffic. 
I spent the first half of the drive on hold with various uncooperative airlines and booking apps, and then relaxed, chatting a bit, with Gbenga. He was interesting and engaging, and never gave the least impression that this travel was anything less than a regular drive with a little adventure thrown in.

What caused me to stop using Uber 6 months ago is being charged a wait time fee when driver
arrive at wrong location. Since GPS not accurate I usually put the street number in meet them at that location in so
driver can find me. Last week, I put in for the driver to meet me on 138 Kinsman Ave. I called my driver he was in 98 Kinsman. I was charged a wait time fee of $6.94
waiting for the driver get to my location. I’m Gold member & have almost perfect rating still couldn’t get any help from customers support. Over the course of week I contacted them 8x to resolve this issue was told multiple times their nothing they can do about it.  At that time I was catching Uber 6 to 7x a week still wouldn’t refund me the money because they said it was policy. At this point I refuse to keep dealing with the mistreatments and have used Lfyt. Avoid using Uber!!!!! 
Update! I have been contacted by developers telling me to contact customer support. I guess they didn’t read the part in which I told them that I contacted customer support 8x receive no support.

In other words I would end up waiting until the driver got all the way to the gate to get a call saying that they can not get to me. I used Uber again today and the same situation occurred. It is a shame that with all the updates Uber has went through that the developers still have not found a way to fix this. The developers of Uber seriously need to fix the app to where it alerts the drivers that the customer is on a military installation, and that if the driver does not have installation access to not take the ride. It is very frustrating for military to have to wait until the driver gets to the gate to find out that the driver can not get on the installation to pick the customer up. It would also behove them to make sure that a good majority of their drivers coordinate with the military installations in the area they are driving in to try to get access to them as this will gain Uber more business.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-23T09:29:48-07:00

My job requires daily travel and I USED Uber. I’ve spent thousands of dollars on rides and gave max tips to all drivers regardless of experience. I was charged on the wrong card which requires a simple fix. The issue is that I cannot update payment method because they’re “having trouble processing your credit card. Try again later”. Now I am not able to use my rides because all payment methods have been erased and I cannot even use my Apple Pay. I contacted and called Uber customer service but I was transferred to 5 people who had no idea how to fix my issue. I stayed on the line just so they can tell me that I have to personally email and await a response. Being that these are business expenses, I need a fix asap. So I am now stuck at work where they’re not accepting any form of payment because I have to “try again later”. So ridiculous that I will NEVER use these services again and that applies to Uber eats. To answer any upcoming stupid questions, yes I did double check my information was entered correctly and yes I deleted and reinstalled the app. Yes I read the dumb articles on the Help page.

I didn’t think because I had $100 voucher from Tesla finally I went back to the service manager and asked him to help me turns out I did need to enter my credit card information even though I had $100 voucher from Tesla so I sat and waited for 45 minutes staring at something on the screen that said five minutes, waiting five minutes away. Four minutes away six minutes away when in fact, that wasn’t the Uber driver at all, I was very frustrated and unhappy with Uber. That map should not be showing a driver is five minutes away.

When it was my friends turn who is 65 on social security bought a $50 Uber gift card put it on her Uber account but lost her phone that day. She got a new phone the next day downloaded the Uber app and the $50 in credit from the gift card is gone and she didn’t use it because I ride with her every day . I helped her email Uber support and answered all of their questions over and over the same questions but never gave up finally they say we will fix it then the next day again they want to know the exact dates of the last two rides and where from and where we were taken too . I told them exactly where from and where too but could not remember the exact days just the week. And apparently that was not enough for them I guarantee they can see with all of the other information given and that there was a gift card uploaded but never used. But they still refuse to put the credits on her account and she is older and on a fixed budget and $50 is a lot of money to her.
