It is very user friendly and didn‚Äôt take me long to get the hang of it when I first got it. The quality of content that I‚Äôm able to produce using the free plan of CapCut, beats most paid video editors. I currently have the CapCut Pro plan because I wanted to try out certain features that weren‚Äôt available on the free plan and only available through the paid plan. This app is worth every penny I have spent so far and some. The new AI tools are absolutely fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait to see what other new tools become available in the future. For anybody who is thinking about going with CapCut, you would be making a wise decision. Skip all the headaches that come with most other editors and get straight to business here. Trust me, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. They have everything you‚Äôll ever need and then some. That‚Äôs assuming you just need something for personal projects for social media and what not. This is a powerful tool and the best part, IT‚ÄôS FREE!! Start with a free plan and give a test run and then pay for Pro and get more AI tools if you wish. I just know that I won‚Äôt be going anywhere anytime soon. Not as long as CapCut is still up and running anyway.

It‚Äôs absolutely just so amazing, and you can make millions of things in CapCut. If you‚Äôre video maker, or are just there for the templates, there‚Äôs something for everyone. However, there are a few things that kind of ruin my experience.\nThe first being CapCut Pro. I want to use CapCut freely, without being constantly nagged about something that costs $8 a month, or $75 yearly. The most awful thing about CapCut Pro is the fact that some of my favorite transitions and animations have been added to CapCut Pro, so I can no longer use them. \nAnother thing that ruins my experience is a bug. I think it was accidentally added in a recent update, because this is new for me. When going through photos and videos in CapCut, like choosing which ones to add to my video, some of the items will be black, like the item is just flat out black, with how long the video is still showing, but I‚Äôm still able to add to add it to my video. As a GachaTuber, this is a ginormous issue because in order to make the videos that I make, I need to take countless screenshots and put them into the editing app. If I can‚Äôt see what the photos are, it adds to my storage trying to take more photos, hoping that they will show up, and lessens my patience and motivation. \nOverall, I absolutely love CapCut and I encourage any and all types of video making in this app. I only hope that the bugs will get fixed and removed so that I can easily keep making videos.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-09T10:51:40-07:00"},{"id":"9329981716","userName":"capcut opionion","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1418679578","version":"7.2.0","score":5,"title":"things I like about CapCut","text":"I love this app because I get to edit and when I‚Äôm to tired or lazy I can use templates so I don‚Äôt have to edit.

The effects are really nice and aesthetic, and some are just really cool. (some are kinda uhm weird imo) the effects are perfect for edits, the retro or vintage ones have to be my favorite! Also the in and out animations are cool, and there are some that are for the whole duration of the video/photo, which is cool. The customization abilities for the text are great. You can give the text a font, color, some special design (example: making it glow) in and out transitions, animations that last for the duration the text is on the screen, and you can put it in a text box or something, and there are some really cute ones!

I have been using this app for like a year now and i think its great and easy to use. i do have some recommendations though because i do find some little issues or something i would like to be better/fixed. so my first recommendation is that you guys should maybe add more animations to both, texts and clips. for the texts, i think itd be cool to have more varieties to choose from. i know there's a lot of choices already but i mean that maybe if possible, there could be combos like there is for clips. i think itd look great on edits and would be very useful. and now for clips, i think if you could add more ins and out transitions, it would be fun to be able to have more transitions. maybe you could even add more combos as well. id also think a new great addition would be if there were to be more shakes and stuff. I dont think theres many shakes to add to your edits so i think more would be cool. another suggestion is to make the speed adjusts cleaner. sometimes when i make it slower, it looks blury or just doesnt look like it has the same quality as it would with normal speed. i do hsve more recommendations id like to share but i dont really know exactly how to explain it but if you could add/fix those things, i think the app would be 5x better! :)","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-03-14T19:09:50-07:00"},{"id":"10774586047","userName":"Lovelyy_eva","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1421536075","version":"10.5.2","score":4,"title":"Amazing but problem.","text":"I love this app!!

I don‚Äôt like how almost everything in the app is Pro, like the fade in text animation. I always use that and I now I can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs pro, same with a lot of other effects and things like that! I understand that CapCut uses the Pro feature to make more money, but putting it on almost everything, including the things that beginners use is just annoying. Like might as well just make everything Pro at this point. CapCut is still a great app, I just don‚Äôt see how the Pro feature is helping anyone. I mean, it‚Äôs helping CapCut get more money from people who use it, but some people that use CapCut can‚Äôt buy the Pro feature, and that‚Äôs a big problem in my opinion. And a lot of beginners start out with using CapCut, and if they can‚Äôt use any good effects how will they ever enhance their video? They won‚Äôt. Unless they use another app like Video Star or something like that, but still that app does cost money to access things. So to end this review, I think the Pro feature should just be removed. And to make more money just boost up the price of the app and add better effects so more people will use CapCut.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-09T20:07:47-07:00"},{"id":"9703769310","userName":"willwillwolf","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1423730661","version":"7.7.2","score":4,"title":"Sad updates i miss the old capcut","text":"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews often so you‚Äôre lucky to be getting one for me but do not get me wrong I love this but when they added the new update where are you cannot even extract the video and you have to pay first, that‚Äôs just ridiculous I kind of miss the old CapCut you need a CapCut pro in order to add certain effects, to even save the video, and to make different things, the old CapCut was way better I can extract the videos for free I don‚Äôt like that new update where in the old CapCut I relied on it and it was one of my favorite editing apps to use, I‚Äôve even heard people say that they don‚Äôt like CapCut anymore and they‚Äôre using a different app called alight motion and I tried to download it but then whenever I went on the app it reminded me of CapCut and then I went back to use the app and then I couldn‚Äôt even extract the video so now it‚Äôs hard to even think about using the app, usually I would give this app at five stars because it was a outstandingly incredible back ago but now I cannot even recognize the app anymore, I just feel alone and deserted whenever I use the app because it just feels weird not being able to do certain things without paying money, please fix that please get the old CapCut back.\n\n-Willow lea preiss","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-03-11T16:05:13-07:00"},{"id":"8226458604","userName":"teuegyefeyegyegeywtywyyw","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1137344998","version":"5.2.0","score":5,"title":"Things that are easy in CapCut","text":"I know that some of y‚Äôall are great editors out there but I‚Äôm gonna give y‚Äôall some more things that you should probably do a .CapCut one of the first things that you should do is you should look at all the edit editing that people have been doing on there and you look at your edits from back then on your other app that you‚Äôve been using this is completely free app you don‚Äôt need any of your money to pay for it these these are facts that are on here are really good they they have a good quality they just look good overall add a lot a lot of affects to one of your pictures or videos and one of the things that I just wanna put out there is that some of y‚Äôall are pros at this and some of y‚Äôall are not processes but that‚Äôs OK because anybody doesn‚Äôt have to be pressed to have a good editing a edit sorry no editing and if you don‚Äôt think your edit is good go back and look through and just look through the edit that you did if you don‚Äôt look through the edit that you did it‚Äôs fine because you can try affects you can try writing on it you can try doing a lot of stuff on it there‚Äôs a lot more stuff than it looks like love CapCut.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-01-10T13:20:23-07:00"},{"id":"9815866551","userName":"Izabwella","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1317892596","version":"7.7.2","score":4,"title":"Great‚Ä¶but a couple concerns","text":"So I absolutely LOVE CapCut. I‚Äôve been using it for years, even before you could post stuff. I‚Äôve made edits of soooo many things, and it‚Äôs really helped me grow into editing. It has amazing features, and is really easy to use. But, there is a couple things. \nSometimes if I add a lot of photos, it lags. Like a lot. My smooth transitions will become sloppy, but when I export it, it‚Äôs perfectly fine. But when I go back to try to adjust it and export it again, I ruin it, only because I can‚Äôt really see what I‚Äôm doing because of the lag. \nAnother thing is the new posting. Well, I guess it‚Äôs not really new, but you know what I mean. Honestly, I love the idea. I just think it wasn‚Äôt really well executed. There are some pretty inappropriate things, and I guess it never gets taken down. So I assume it‚Äôs not very closely monitored. And a lot of people steal edits. Like DHARMA. SHES STEALING VAYDAS EDITS. AND SHE NEVER OWNS UP. \nThere is A LOT of hate. Like sooo much hate. I‚Äôve seen people venting and expressing themselves through edits. I‚Äôve seen face reveals and clips of the creators, and there is always hate in the comments. But it‚Äôs never taken down. \nOverall, the app is great. Easy to use. But be warned if you‚Äôre going to be a creator. There will always be a hater.

CapCut is great for kids like me because it is super easy to learn, and to use. Also, I have always wanted to have a Yt channel, I use Capcut for pretend video making and I rly enjoy it! All though‚Ä¶. I have noticed that sometimes when I am adding audio and my clip it doesn‚Äôt align and the audio is more up from the beginning. Not very often it‚Äôs funky but idk why it acts like this. As well as my screen will freeze for some time. Also, I noticed CapCut has gotten so much better! Idk if I didn‚Äôt see this before, but I am loving the new Template feature! I really love it. So much faster then putting work in for edits when I‚Äôm feeling lazier. Also, there is a rly big amount of texts and effects which is great! One more thing, so, the ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù feature on here. So, I use this for auto velocity. You don‚Äôt need to do anything but wait for it to upload to your edit. However, this takes way too much of my time. It moves by wayyyyy to slow.

But then about January of 2023, a bunch of stupid 12 year olds started lieing about their age to become capcut creators. And now it's October of 2023 and you can scroll for as long as you want and legit the only videos are stupid vent videos. I believe venting is healthy but it's not for capcut. When you make templates, it's supposed to be so other people can use them for great edits. Not to just brag about how much you do SH or just to legit tell people not to blow up your notifications for a couple minutes. I miss the old capcut. I'm sick of only seeing 12 year olds just talk about breaking up with their boyfriends or how their grandma died. Yes those things are sad but I'm sure people reading this understand. Please do something about it because you can't actually find a good simple edit anymore. I try to search something and all that comes up is vent videos. I will literally go into the effect category and it's just vent videos. Even the travel category is just vent videos. I'm sick of this. You can find any actual edits anymore.

I clicked on a advertisement and then went back to the app. I went to the help center and it said i had to pay a dollar. I had a dollar in my apple account so I used it. It said I had to do bank account stuff witch took me about a hour or two to do. I finally found out how to get the the help center and I chatted with someone or maybe a robot (most likely a robot) it said to me that they can‚Äôt remove the advertisements.

I even tried to turn on the screen lock but it doesn‚Äôt work.

And it does not load very quick. So obviously this problem has made me very annoyed. I tried deleted the app, it didn‚Äôt work and I lost everything I had. And if I accidentally closed the tab, I would have to do the problem all over again! This small problem becomes a big one,  as it‚Äôs wastes so much time.

I have tried and used a lot of editing apps, but finally I could find CapCut  and immediately I decided to choose this app and use it for the rest of my life. But unfortunately, there is just one problem in the app which is when you use the app in the English language mode you can‚Äôt add eastern languages text for your video, when you try to write something down, it will be written down in vice versa mode or exactly opposite what you wrote down. I hope that you can fix this problem really soon as soon as possible for us because we want to use the app in English language mode and add Kurdish or Arabic or Urdu texts for our videos. I am Kurd and we are approximately 40 million people and each one of us who use this app have the same problem with adding text in our language to our videos, and I really appreciate it because this app is just amazing.

However, almost every time I save an edit after finishing, there is a problem. I go back to check the saved video and clips aren‚Äôt timed the same, have weird snippets of other clips that annoy transitions, and overall format of the videos sometimes change. On the latest edit I had to move around the picture so it didn‚Äôt always fit the screen and there were sometimes black bars. I just assumed that I could crop it afterwards off the app (since there is no simple crop tool, only format change). I exported my clip almost double digit times, each time going back to fix the little new mistake that was generated. Milliseconds of a previous clip will be in the next and it ruin the transitions. Then when I would fix it, another would go wrong making it extremely frustrating. It just seems like there‚Äôs literally too much for either the all of my phone to handle. I have an iPhone XR with plenty of storage so I doubt it‚Äôs that. Very disappointed because I don‚Äôt feel as excited or confident about my edit which preformed much better in the actual preview on the app then in my camera roll‚Ä¶","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-10-11T19:22:21-07:00"},{"id":"8970325087","userName":"ldchapman","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id38128261","version":"6.5.0","score":4,"title":"It‚Äôs good, but‚Ä¶","text":"The app is really easy and simple to use, I‚Äôve been using it for some time now and there are a lot of thing that I recommend. 1. Add a new loop animation In the text where it‚Äôs warping the text around, or just a mix of all the wave loop animations. What I‚Äôm saying on this one is that there isn‚Äôt many loop animations for things that I‚Äôm doing, and an easy way to make this is just get in the text and warp it around a bit, basically have random areas go in random directions, them do[ that for a couple of frames then put it back as the first then just ease the motions a bit so it looks better. 2. There are some small lag features where you start the project and there is a little bit of large as you start it, this can get annoying for many reasons like, making it harder to sync things when you need to and many others, this is a pretty small but harsh things can happen with this. 3. Make the auto beat inputer more accurate and put the closer together when doing so, this can save time on songs with a BPM over around 150. Pretty minor also, but it is just one thing I recommend ‚Äúfixing‚Äù.

This is  the best editing app I have, it‚Äôs literally my life! Everything is so easy to figure out, and there‚Äôs so many things to do! It never crashes, the transitions are beautiful, there is a very wide variety of effects and so much more. First off, the transitions. They are so great, and there is so many types of them! You can keep it plain or change it up with some effects in the transition! Next, the effects. They‚Äôre so amazing, and there is so many to choose from. There are categories like bling, party, shadow, comic and more! You can also add texts to your video. You can choose how long the text stays on screen, choose from a big selection of fonts, colors and effects to your text! Again, everything is so easy to do and very easy to figure out. I use this so much for so many kinds of edits. My favorite part about this is that you can add audio. You can choose from a lot of different default sounds, extract audio from video clips, and trim the sound! CapCut is amazing, and if you‚Äôre looking for an editing app I definitely suggest this!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2021-06-04T15:17:52-07:00"},{"id":"8393440306","userName":"Jacob Frey","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id556873822","version":"5.4.0","score":4,"title":"Trash","text":"I think that the app is amazing I use it on all of my TikTok videos but one very minor criticism of the app I have is that if maybe I delete some thing but i maybe deleted the wrong thing or I have a good idea that I want to put into the video I just made but because I deleted the original draft on CapCut because I was going to post a TikTok for example I won‚Äôt be able to go back and get the original draft from CapCut if I deleted it. So what I‚Äôm trying to say is I think that there should be a temporary trash pile section so that just in case somebody deleted the wrong thing or they want to edit it but didn‚Äôt expect to, they don‚Äôt have to worry about redoing everything they just did they can just go back to the original thing and recover it and just add in or take out whatever it is they were going to do. The trash pile would be the best thing that you could add to the app right now that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôve given a four star review if I could‚Äôve given a four and a half I would but it doesn‚Äôt work that way with the ratings so it really is a very minor thing but it can be quite annoying otherwise please consider it it‚Äôs very simple","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-02-24T21:17:32-07:00"},{"id":"9970861595","userName":"5st!","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1196714388","version":"8.3.0","score":5,"title":"It‚Äôs great!

CapCut is great for making smooth edits because you can make a video / picture as short as 0.1 seconds! That‚Äôs great for making Gacha characters look incredible in edits! Another great thing about this app is that you can remove the watermark from the edit without paying for some sort of premium. (AHEM- GachaLifeMaker better be taking notes) The chroma key in this app is great for removing green screens, and any other color screens! (This is good for when a character has smth like green eyes) The keyframe feature makes CapCut great for tweening, and many other things! The effects and transitions are super clean and amazing, and from experience, even better than some apps you might have to pay for! All in all, this app is an all - around amazing app for everyone who might be interested in making edits, no matter the experience, and is a huge upgrade from any apps you might have to pay for! CapCut is definitely worth all 5 stars!

This is basically the sole reason why I am writing this review. I don‚Äôt even know why this app has a rating of only 4.5. It should be at least 4.8. But just like any other video editing app (I should be sorry to say this lol) it has it‚Äôs flaws. I want more filters, like an invert filter. Also some people may not understand English so it may be a problem for them if they want a video editing app that could feature their language. That also applies to the effects, filters, etc. So please, allow users to select their own language. It could also be good if you could put a dark mode, be able to save your music, or SFX to the app, and name your video before you start your project. This is all I have to say. Hopefully CapCut listens to my review, so that all users of this app could get a comfortable video editing experience.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-08-10T21:02:31-07:00"},{"id":"8701367427","userName":"^Gamer^Bear^","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1411410138","version":"5.8.3","score":5,"title":"Been using it for a year now and still loving it.","text":"Capcut offers so many different effects and filters to choose from.

Will you be the next to download?\n\nDear owner of CapCut,\nI would like to tell you an idea that I have for a effect. So the effect would basically be like a zooming in effect. There will be 5-20 pictures on a screen that the editor will pick the background color of. They can pick 5-20 photos out of their albums and then place them on the screen. They will look like little pictures that you would take out of a polaroid camera. Then once their music hits the beat drop then the zoom comes in. It will automatically zoom in to a random photo that the editor has chosen. Then their will be some shakes or  other effects that will be given to make the edit look good. And the. It will zoom out of the picture and then zoom into another. This will happen 2-3 times. And yeah, that‚Äôs my idea thanks for your time!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1500855883&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-23T14:57:22-07:00"},{"id":"10542472227","userName":"strawberry__fairy_playz yt","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1470960852","version":"9.7.1","score":4,"title":"Meh kinda good","text":"It‚Äôs kinda hard to use and everything good costs money and I think it‚Äôs a bit a scam if you pay money just fro some virtual effect that will do nothing tbh,but the templates are ‚Äúchiefs kissüòô‚Äù amazing and it‚Äôs easy to use but the only problem abt templates is that I think you should be able to 1.

Change how many photos, this one depends on the type of template but if it‚Äôs a template that showcasing immagaes and you 1. Don‚Äôt have enough photos or 2. Have to many photos and want more. You should be able to choose how many photos you want is videos like that  Also another thing, the AI filters, I think CapCut shouldn‚Äôt post your photos Like come on man like let people have there privacy And I kinda think a lot of it is ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù I said this already but the ‚ÄúCapCut pro‚Äù is kinda a money grab and you should be able to use whatever you want to use.

I just wanted to suggest that you guys that run this app give more creative control over the effects, for example letting us fade them in and fade out, how fast or slow we want the effects. I also wanted to suggest and ask if you guys could put in an option where we just switch are clips from video to overlay and also the ability to lock/pin our overlays. Also, an option where we can automatically resize our video to full screen because since there‚Äôs not an option to it may not go 100% back to the full screen. Last thing I‚Äôd like to request is if you guys could put an option where we can unlink the audio from the video two adjusted and move around as necessary.
