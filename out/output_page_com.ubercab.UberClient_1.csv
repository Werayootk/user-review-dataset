In this economy it’s literally impossible for a 20 year old to save money and getting a car. I grew up poor so it’s not like I could be gifted a car. Nobody is able to give me rides to and from work everyday. Uber you have literally saved my life during times I was struggling most. When I had not even a penny to my name and being consumed in debt. There was always one day where I couldn’t get home. Both of those times I thought I ran out of options. Thinking I’d have to walk 4+ hours home. Knowing I didn’t have a dollar I’d try Lyft, they couldn’t help me. I was super sad and thought all hope was lost. Then I’d tried Uber, it’d say the payment didn’t go through. But on those occasions even when I already had to pay uber back they allowed me to get home. Giving me hope and time to redeem my debts. I literally cried both times it happened. Once in 2020, when the buses stopped running on new years and it was freezing and my clothes were soaking from work, y’all were there to help me out in my time of need. And today, where I’m in a very similar predicament, and thought all hope was lost, y’all were there, to lend me a hand.

Unfortunately, Uber has become a master of deception using its large user base to suggest confidence, but after getting a quote for a little over 40 dollars, my wife and I ended up getting charged almost 100 dollars because of difference in “time” and “distance.” I would be fine if that were the truth, but instead we had a driver that wasn’t focused and missed his exit, then his phone died and we had to use our own phones to guide him. This resulted in us having to drive another 30 minutes just because their own driver didn’t plan ahead or pay attention to the road. I will NEVER use Uber again because the only thing they did to “fix” the problem was give me 5 Uber bucks without any notification and then ignore any requests sent via app to find a proper resolution. So much for customer “support.”
                    UPDATE
After a few days of trying to find out how to talk with support staff directly I was able to reach a satisfying solution. I believe the best way to avoid situations like this would be to make the app send a notification when support staff message you, instead of you having to dig and find out where to talk to them. Because of their understanding I may use Uber again, but just be wary about knowing where to contact anyone in case of a bad ride.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-10-01T18:24:54-07:00

Well two cancellations from drivers later, and another long wait in the cold, the car arrived over 30+ minutes after the first quoted ETA of 3 minutes.  This has happened multiple times.
I have also had several white knuckle moments because the driver had insufficient skills on top of complete unfamiliarity with the route and no ability in speaking or understanding any English.  This causes many problems and has become a critical safety issue when for example a driver made a u turn going the wrong way into three oncoming lanes of traffic on a major four lane artery.  He completely ignored my emphatic alarm because he did not understand a word I said. I expect at a minimum the driver be fluent in the dominant language of the area he is driving in.  I would be equally unhappy to find a taxi driver in Italy who did not speak Italian.  Unless you want to provide a language rating this is unacceptable when my life is at risk in a speeding vehicle with a dangerous driver who may as well be deaf.  I do not care where the driver was born.

Some don’t talk which is fine and very few don’t respect the road. Rides show up on time and get me where I need to go as soon as possible. HOWEVER, this app has good amount of problems. Uber doesn’t do a good job at managing prices. One time this app tried charging me $40 for a 9 min ride home, that’s way out of my price range for a short ride with no traffic and decent weather. Sometimes Uber drivers will make you wait 10-15min then cancel your ride right after. That is the main reason I’m making this review, today just lost 40 min worth of time since I had 3 drivers finish up trips that took around 10-15min and cancelled right after. I could’ve been home within those 40 min I lost. Uber should really do discounts if drivers are going to waste people’s time like that. Also prices are just way out of my price range when it snows. I understand charging more due to weather conditions but sometimes the prices can just be absolutely ridiculous and that’s where Uber becomes unreliable. I love that you can buy bus tickets through this app since it helps save money for how I decide to travel. By all means, DO NOT take this review as an insult!

However they need to fix some issues that keep me from wanting me to. For starters the seller fees are absolutely ridiculous! I should not have to be charged for my drivers errors. I have had numerous occasions of being charged a $5 fee for my driver not being able to find my house. Which brings me to my next problem. 

The GPS navigation they have going is a mess. My old house was a difficult yet not impossible location to find. The u-turn by the gas station was right by the driveway to my house which is easy to miss. However I have tried contacting my Uber drivers giving them guidance. Some still ended up canceling. I have had drivers that would decide it was better to take a longer way for certain places rather than back ways and shortcuts. That also makes everything 10 times  worse, because I have been late to work even scheduled ahead of time since these problems with your system have occurred. 

I’m also currently disabled and can’t/shouldn’t drive, because of it. However I can’t blame Uber for being late for work even though it most certainly is.

What they do is, give you a preset list of 4 or 5 possible issues you may have with a specific ride (so no complaints if 5 drivers in a row cancel right before they are at your location). If you click on the thing from the list they just run your trip through some automated program that determines if you get your money back. My most recent incident my driver took a terrible route, then took two wron turns, adding 30 minutes to what was originally estimated to be a 30 minute trip total, and the navigation app he was using said it would be another 30 minutes. At that point it was literally quicker to walk the last 1 ½ miles. So I got out and walked, but it shows up as me having completed the trip, so whether I select driver took poor route or trip was too long, it just spits out an answer based on incomplete information.

Someone is making money by channeling traffic elsewhere (for additional fees and with added DELAYS); a blue “box” locks you out but interestingly calling Uber for an inbound drop off to your selected location away from the main terminal is allowed. The current “rigged” setup is also bad in case of an emergency because we can NO longer rely on the app to direct the driver where we actually are. Just for the record, there is nothing wrong with the GPS signal on our phone or iPad AND rebooting the app is completely useless, just like most of the developer’s “canned” responses.

Hopped in the car, about halfway into the short trip I tip the driver. Once we arrived at the hotel, I had to kind of wrestle with the groceries to get it out of the back of the Tesla model 3. I grabbed my iPhone off the backseat, and since the Uber app was open, I inadvertently canceled the ride. I didn’t realize this until I got into the hotel and was going to rate the driver. The driver had already left the area. I contacted Uber on the help portion of the app, and I received an email asking me for more information. I detailed the story, and this morning I had an email saying we’re sorry you didn’t make it to your destination, and we’re sorry that you were unsatisfied with the driver. It refunded my money. So, the problem was not addressed, and the driver got shafted.
The app needs a little bit of finessing to have a two-step cancellation process so that grabbing the phone Kent accidentally do it. Thanks.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-17T15:56:17-07:00

Increasingly, they are wrong and seem to be a bait and switch. Routinely, the app says, for example, it will take 3 minutes to be picked up so, i request ride. But as soon as a driver confirms pickup, the time until pickup becomes a lot longer. And regardless of the pickup time listed, 9 of 10 times it takes considerably longer for the driver to arrive. I can’t tell If this is an app or driver problem or both.  Regarding the app, it looks to me like bait and switch. Get me to select a ride with short pickup time, and suddenly after selecting the ride double it or more. And even the extended time is wrong and the driver takes longer to arrive. This problem continues to worsen.  I also now sometimes see drivers not responding to rides, at least on the app. On the driver location, I’ll see a driver sit without moving for minutes before coming to get me. I don’t know if it’s a problem with the app or the driver accepting a ride and taking his to time before coming to get me. This happened at an airport pickup last night again. I walked past the cabs because it showed a 3 minute pickup time But actial pickup was 10 min and i could have practically been home already in the taxi.

I thought to myself, “Well, that’s weird, but I’m sure the customer support at such a large corporation must be pretty good, I’ll see if they can help me.” 
So I look up the number for Uber support, and to my surprise, I wasn’t able to find one. I was told to redownload the app, and use the in app customer support, which is what I did. I explained to the representative my situation, and even mentioned how I’ve never taken an Uber ANYWHERE, and have never gotten a delivery. Yet I was told again and again that they were only able to refund the current month, and the previous month, and that every other charge would remain, which is absolutely ridiculous.
 I understand that $30 is nothing to a massive company like Uber, but $30 is make or break for me. It seems like nobody will listen to reason. I’ve been conned out of $50, only to be refunded $20 and get treated like that fixes everything, and that I should be thanking them, despite not returning the other $30. I just want a refund for a purchase that I CLEARLY didn’t intend to make. I’ve never had this issue with ANY other company, and this is such a poor showing from you, Uber.

I did make my flight and the third driver was good but I then was not given the $10 credit on my first ride, was charged an additional $5 for a driver not showing up and then cancelling, and had to pay almost $25 more than if my first request was honored.

Perhaps, the drivers aren't able to see what the customer has typed, the map, the address, gps, the live blue dot and the live symbolic car that represents the car that the uber driver is driving. Those all must be buggy as well.  Maybe, the maps are incorrect, too? The drivers can't seem to use gps and a live location from the passenger (blue dot) to find where they're going or where the passenger is waiting. 
Rating system has problems as well. Star ratings can't be used to choose a driver. If the driver accepts and he or she has a low rating, you can cancel, but expect to pay the penalty fee. Driver's cancel all the time, but are not charged a fee. Perhaps a system error is to blame as no one would chose an arbitrary rating system except an old tv show where the points don't matter. 
Final app issue: wait times. When the app says, five minutes away, it really means 12-15 minutes away. You can cancel, but your credit card will be charged each and every time unless you dispute the charge. Maybe, it's supposed to be like that? Seems counterintuitive, and unlike a similar app that doesn't have incorrect wait times, penalties for customers and an arbitrary rating system where the points don't matter.

Solid drivers, decent prices. Fortunately, I never had to reach out to customer service for anything. That changed last week. I was charged a $150 cleaning fee for something that should not have been that bad. Mind you, I do fully admit I should’ve been charged a fee; however, I felt like it should’ve been $40 - $80 at the very most. I reached out to customer service FOUR separate times. The first two times they replied to my message with the exact same cookie cutter response. I replied back to each one and got no response back. I reached out a third time signaling how upset I was, finally got a different reply asking what I’d like them to do to remedy the situation. I asked them to give me a lower cleaning fee and listed my reasons why I believed that it should be lower. No response. My fourth message let them know that if they didn’t reply I would stop using their services and leave a negative review on their apps. No response. Why? Because they don’t care. What’s one customer lost?
Uber doesn’t have a customer service phone number. Probably because they don’t want to deal with customers because they simply don’t care about them, only the money they cough up. I’m done using Uber, Uber Eats, Postmates, and all of these other Uber subsidiaries.

However, the last ride was disappointing and followed by an unexpected and utterly unwarranted clean-up fee. First, the driver tried to drop her off at a nearby intersection instead of at her house, even though it was late at night. The whole point of getting an Uber was to get home safely, and riders shouldn’t have to ask to get dropped off at the actual drop-off location. Then in the morning, we were horrified, outraged, and baffled to see that a huge cleaning fee was added to the fare. I had been on the phone and texting her before, during, and after the trip. She did not vomit in the car, nor did she even bring food or drinks in the car. She left the car in the same condition in which she entered it: mess-free. Moreover, I still have a 5-star rating, which wouldn’t make sense if my friend had left a mess in the car. So…riders, beware! It wouldn’t occur to me to take pictures of the car before and after, but maybe it is necessary to take such precautions to avoid scams. It is unclear how long it takes Uber to follow up on disputes or how the process works, and it isn’t easy to get hold of someone instead of an automated menu.

However, I have had 2 issues recently that if fixed would make it AMAZING.  I live in NYC and normally take uber pool.  I have no problem walking a few blocks, however sometimes the place I’m walking to is not possible for the driver to get to without going very out of the way.  There have been a lot of updates to traffic patterns in NYC in the last 6 months and I don’t think uber gps has been updated with these. (Example: no left turn allowed onto 8th Avenue going east on 14th street - this is my typical pickup location and the driver usually has to spend 5 minutes driving around the block unless I text him to meet me elsewear). The other problem which is a recent one that has happened the past 2 days is that I get matched with a very convenient driver, walk to the pickup location very happily and then they cancel. The next drivers (multiple) I am matched with are extremely far away (up to 10 minutes) and I am forced to cancel and get into a yellow cab because I am now late.  Drivers should not be able to cancel when they are that close to picking up their rider, especially with uber pool where that person has most likely walked decently far to get there.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-04-30T06:15:45-07:00

It involves meeting your Uber at a determined location, this is very good and an excellent way to mainstream the process and make it more efficient.
But unfortunately the AI in control of matching the rider with the Uber seems to be based on distance away from the rider instead of actual logistics.
This is a problem for me since my pickup spots are always near an highway/expressway on street level (BQE in NYC) and the Ubers that are matched to me are always traveling on said expressway instead of on the side streets. Because of this, I've been matched with multiple Ubers that are traveling on the expressway and who's nearest exit is 30 minutes away. Due to this fact I couldn't even cancel the Uber since I would be charged a 5 dollar fee for due to the driver having to drive past me. 
This leaves me with 3 options either take the 5 dollar fee and call another Uber or to call the driver and ask them to cancel the pick-up. Wait an extra half-hour for an uber. The 2nd option is often met with hostility with some drivers, and the 3rd option is just not feasible due to the driver having to drive back and then drop you off adding an extra hour to the commute.

Also as a warning….if you are not familiar with the area you are riding, drivers who are not honest can drive you the longest way possible to get you to your destination just like taxi drivers do if you are in unfamiliar location.

When I could look at the GPS and find several other routes that were quicker and less of a hassle. And finally, i want to mention that i dont even use the pool option anymore because it feels like taking the bus. I sat in a pool once and before I got to my stop we picked up and dropped off 4 other people. I wouldnt have minded if it was on the way to my destination but it was so out of the way I considered getting out and taking the bus. I have to take alot of cabs because of work and I’m always disappointed with Uber, if I had a better option I wouldnt use this app anymore.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-12-11T11:38:38-07:00

I initially requested an uber today because I locked my keys in the trunk of my car while I was loading my clothes at the laundry. I was so devastated because I had my teenage son at the barbershop getting a haircut, and I was supposed to pick him up when I was done. Well, back to the beginning as I was loading my stuff my keys fell in the trunk, I closed it before realizing they were there. I was most concerned about my son waiting for me for such a long time, I requested different stops, made many mistakes doing so because I was frantic and going through severe panic and this gentleman was so kind the whole step of the way. He was beyond patient with me as I tried to figure out were exactly we were going, and then turning back, and adding stops and he made me feel so understood as a mom while he patiently waited for me to get it together. He definitely deserves more then 5 stars. He is a genuinely a kind person and anyone traveling with him will definitely enjoy a nice ride with a kind human being. 

Thank you so much for being kind to me, I appreciate you very much!

A customer reported that he didn’t receive his food from Uber. I went to the customers door and asked if he received his food. A slight moment of hesitant then said no( I always wait for the customer to come out and grab their food at least 5 mins sometime they are not home) I let him know I watch him come to the door look around for a bit then grab the food. This day I was driving my other car and forgot to change it on the app. I expressed to the customer I would like for him to let Uber know he received the food. He expressed he would. Later that evening about 2 dreadful hours of cancellations and small order. I received another big order to this customer which was Chinese which was for the same customer. He also reported this order missing this time I recorded it. I expressed to Uber the situation with the customer after reporting twice he didn’t receive his food. Uber told me this happening twice in the same day resulted in my account being deactivated. As A result I ordered the same exact meal for this customer and may have added a little something to make him go poopoo you welcome sir and Uber you are absolutely repulsing if I was someone making a livelihood on this app instead of pocket change after work you would be ruining someone’s life by word of speculation and the fact I had to go out of my way to prove it and get banned for exposing a lying customer.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-21T15:00:15-07:00

If she does not show up she is charged. She ordered an Uber and one after another 5 total Ubers drivers canceled on her and she had to walk over a mile to the vet carrying her cat, supplies and pet medication. Why aren’t Uber cars more reliable?! Uber cars need to be told the destination before they accept the job. I heard that Uber car drivers are sent a job, click accept and after the fact learn the destination. At this point they simply cancel if they don’t want to go there while the person who ordered the Uber has to wait an additional 10-15 minutes for another Uber car and is charged a cancellation fee. If you have an important time sensitive meeting or doctors appointment like we had you are up the creek. What kind of backwards thinking is Uber using?! We have also had issues with Uber drivers picking up in the wrong location. We provide the exact address where we are and they are way down the block where we can’t see them. Has Uber not heard of addresses and geolocations going by the phone? The Uber programmers need to find a better job and new developers hired.

I understand that when ordering an uber that the timing is what determines the price, however, for the scheduling an uber option, there should be more clarification on how much the price can range. Giving a price range that only shows a 7 dollar price difference does not encapsulate how much the uber can actually be. Also, not only that, but when you schedule an uber, you are not allowed to see the actual price of the ride until AFTER you take it. If I schedule an uber that ranges from $13-$17, I expect the ride to be around that price then, maybe even a little higher, but not much more than that. There should be an option to see the actual price when the driver is on his or her way because if it is going to be too expensive, I would rather cancel it and pay the cancellation fee than pay an absurd fare. If I schedule an uber some time in advance, I should realistically be able to see the price of it when the driver is on the way so it is fair. It is not ethical to have the app designed this way with no way of seeing the real fare of a scheduled uber before taking it. I have not had any other issues with this service except for the lack of this quintessential feature. Also I won’t mention the lack of customer support... I can’t even email Uber a complaint.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2020-09-06T21:21:50-07:00

Currently, at times they are worse than taxis were prior to Uber. Each app upgrade is more glitchy than the previous one. Many times I receive wrong pick up location from my home and other locations. Pickup at the Atlanta Airport are only getting worse every week. First, the passengers have to walk unreasonably long distance to the pickup location, which are poorly marked and require passengers to walk thru a very creepy garage. Then the wait times for the ride is getting longer and longer. The drivers take longer than estimated pick up time. I fly every week and the decline in service is very noticeable. Not to mention the fees keep going higher and higher. Uber is getting worse than taxis. At least with taxis I don’t have to walk unreasonably long distance and wait for the driver. One more thing, Atlanta airport installed heating lamps in the Uber pick up area, which is the most idiotic thing to do in 90 degree weather. 

Furthermore, more and more Uber drivers install obnoxious air refresheners that are overwhelming and headaches inducing. Can Uber develop air refreshener policy. Because if I cancel the ride based on smelly car then Uber will charge me cancellation fee - not fair. Taxis don’t do that. If I don’t like the quality of taxi then I don’t get in without paying fees.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-04T01:32:41-07:00

I really wish Uber would give you the option of seeing miles instead of kilometers, and also American dollars currency. I would have used Uber sooo much more it having that option to change in settings. For example, I used it today in Mexico. I wanted to go to a certain store. I put it in the Uber app, and it showed around $40, I thought it must be really far. Looking at the map, it showed kilometers. Then I noticed it was showing the cost in pesos. I had no idea how far it really was, or what it would charge me in American currency. SUCH A PAIN. The ride ended up being not so far, and only around $3 American. Then the top popped up, I clicked on $5 thinking it was a couple of dollars. Later my daughter figures it out and tells me that the $5 only ended being like twenty four cents. I felt so bad. UBER really needs to make a setting that you can choose what you want your miles/kilometers and currency to show. I seriously would be using it more here in Mexico, but too difficult because I can’t see what it’s really going to cost me, and clueless on how far of a distance it is.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=368677368&type=Purple%20Software,2019-06-21T01:18:26-07:00

I’ve rarely had an issue with Uber rides, this is primarily about Uber eats but unfortunately the two are connected to one account. I stopped using Uber eats for a while to save money and kept getting spammed with emails despite unsubscribing. I then decided to use Uber eats twice yesterday and had issues with both orders. The first one the food was spoiled the second never came. I did order late at night so my phone was on silent and missed the delivery person’s call despite watching the app closely to see when he arrived and showing up at the door when the app said it was here. I was sick and ordered soup so this really made my night worse as I did not have it in me to cook so I ended up going to bed hungry after already feeling like garbage. There was no one out there and no food left at my door. Sure someone could’ve stolen it in the seconds it took for me to check my door (I live in a city) however our block is quiet and I’ve never had food stolen before. It seems to me the delivery guy kept it for himself and because he called me twice and I didn’t answer he then got free food on my dime. They refused to refund me for this reason. I’m never using this service again. If you do, make sure you’re outside before they get there and answer your phone when they call or risk throwing your money away.

I don’t know if this is happening to anyone else but now I see a wait time fee on my receipt. I understand there is a wait time charge if the Uber driver arrives and they are obviously kept waiting but recently quite often the Uber driver can be at the corner of my block stating it arrives soon and I’m waiting outside and at the end of my trip I see there is a charge for wait time. How can that be if I was ready and they weren’t even in front of the pick up location. Or I’ve have a few times where the driver states it’s here but they aren’t at the correct pick up even though I put the address and they are a few buildings away and then I have to walk to them and that causes them to start charging a wait time fee. Not sure if that is their GPS issue but it’s annoying. Just the other day I requested an Uber and I was outside and the driver instead of heading straight which is where I was he drove around the block before arriving to me and then headed my way, mind you there was no traffic or others cars there for him giving him reason to go around the block. And what do you know I was charged a wait time fee. This is very frustrating and I have reached out to support which they have helped but it’s annoying to constantly be going thru support.

This was absolutely the worst Driver that I have ever had anywhere. It was a very simple drive from the Chicago Western Suburbs to downtown Chicago. My first tip off was that he parked out in the middle of the street to pick me up. Didn’t even bother to enter my driveway. He also  had a major challenge with English. I asked him if he understood where I needed to go 6 times and he had a fundamental lack of ability to respond in English. Despite using GPS, he managed to take the wrong direction 3 times. He ended up taking I294 toward OHare vs 88 to downtown Chicago. When got near OHare he exited at Balmoral and told me he was turning around to take 290 to Chicago. Sure, that makes sense, let’s just go back to where we started and waste another 25 minutes. I told him to take 90 into the city and that seemed to only confuse him even more even though the exit for 90 was less than a mile away. I had to provide him turn by turn directions to reach the entrance to 90 despite the fact that he was using GPS. I was 30 minutes late for my meeting and didn’t have the time to share with him how unsatisfied I was with his service. The real kicker came when I received my receipt as I was charged for all the extra distance we traveled that was due to his negligence and inability to use GPS and understand my directions.

Leaving me not being able to rate that driver & let him know what an inconvenience he has caused me. Also, normally you would be able to cancel your ride free of charge if your driver was more than 5 minutes away, today my driver was 13 minutes away, I cancelled because I was in too much of a hurry & was still charged $5. I'm extremely OVER this app, I will begin to use my local TLC driver companies from now on since they so conveniently make you comfortable ordering their vehicles and they actually give you real life people experiences even when you’ve been inconvenienced. I also have had drivers lie about their vehicles that they’ve been traveling in but because the license plate matched then I had to ride in that vehicle. Reaching out to Uber has become a joke because they purposefully make you feel like you’re the problem and their well within their means to do and have drivers do as they please. The support at Uber has become nonexistent and they’re prices have increased so dramatically that I should basically buy my own vehicle and pay my own gas and insurance, it would be so much cheaper.

Without warning and even during times that aren’t expected high traffic times. 

On top of that their customer service is literally the worst I’ve ever experienced. Maybe 1/10 experiences were easy and straight forward. The rest were filled with an app that makes getting support as annoying and complicated as possible. And when you did get through you get cut and paste prompts that clearly came from a manual and didn’t address your issue at all. Like not even close to the topic you contacted them for.   8/10 reps were very poorly trained, regularly gave me conflicting and completely inaccurate information, had poor customer service skills and were wildly inefficient in getting you to a resolution. I was a regular customer and they still were so difficult.  If I was driving I would have deleted this app awhile ago. Uber’s way of doing business is so disrespectful to it’s riders and drivers have regularly complained of their upsetting and difficult experiences with Uber as well.
