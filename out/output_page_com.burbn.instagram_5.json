Why did I spend anytime on that app. Maybe to see what others are doing or to get some good advice from like minded ppl. Probably the best thing it offers is a false promise that you can be someone you are not. Once you place your device down you realized nothing will come from what you just saw. This is because fortunate ppl have fortunate lives and even if yours isn't that back you become so full of visual stimulation you actually visualize yourself in the video, clip, feed or what ever. Well guess what you not them and that's what life is really about. Being different and facing challenges on your own terms. I have had over 2 million views in the past and I can only try to recreate that reach. You won't ever let the mule reach the carrot on the stick.  So, other than that I think it's pretty fun to push my limits for tolerance and misuse while other might not be that interesting even when they pay.

When you  publish it takes away your original draft (idiotically so there is no backup to resort to if what you post had a mistake). Now the audio won’t attach. I can’t click DONE when i try to attach it. When it acted like it had attached, you STILL couldn’t hear it in preview. I made sure the app was updated. I closed the app and reopened. I turned my phone off and back on. Still issues. Wow.

So now I have to shoot all footage on my phone, and I can only upload it and edit right when I want to post, I can’t save anything for later. One time when I was able to post a draft the fonts were all messed up and I had to delete the whole thing and redo it. I have seen on online forums that the draft issue is common and has been going on for a year without resolution. The algorithm is also extremely frustrating, my first reels which weren’t as good since I just started doing them got several thousand views and hundreds of likes, and when I started making better quality ones they barely get any views.

Currently this is an ongoing battle with the story highlights. My friends can see the ones I’ve posted previously, but on my account on my phone, they are gone and the option to view mine or others is simply not present. I have a feeling it might have to do with the fact I do not have more than 400 followers. Those with low numbers possibly are at higher risk for getting the new features last? That’d be a real bummer if that’s the case.

First of all, the non chronological order that propagates our feed is frustrating to say the least. It feels clunky and I feel like I don’t get to see all the posts from users that I follow. I’m not even sure what the order of the feed represents. Are they popular posts? Top posts? At least give us the option to choose wether we want our feeds in chronological order or (omakase style). Another annoying change is with regards to the browse interface. You all know what I’m talking about. When you click a post to see the details you no longer can scroll up or down to see the other posts in the order of the thumbnails. Now it’s all similar posts. Whose idea was that? Oh and for some reason if you click on pic thumbnail that’s next to a larger video thumbnail, it only opens the video and not the post you actually are trying to see. The last thing that I can think of is when I’m on a user’s IG and I’m looking through their posts (thumbnails) when I click on one to see the details why can’t I scroll up or down to view the details of their previous or next post? I have to go back to thumbnails and then click the next. Ugh. Ok. I’m done.

I've been using Instagram for years and I loved how it was a relevant social media platform that's not completely bogged down by ads and politics.\n\nI loved being able to see what my friends and family are up to in a visual medium, which used to be the entire point of Instagram. Then, they started featuring more and more ads and the more they pushed with the ads, the less I would visit the app. However, around this time they also changed the feed algorithm, no longer sorting it by the most recent post, so whenever I go on it, my entire feed is at least 10 days old. I no longer enjoy scrolling through my Instagram feed, because instead of being able to immediately interact with the photos, I need to check the date on each one first. Scrolling through the feed has become a chore and as a result, I only visit the app about once a month now. I've debated deleting my account multiple times and if they do not revert back to the old algorithm soon, I probably will because I can't justify keeping an app on my phone that I don't use it enjoy.\n\nAt the very least, I can understand some ads here and there because companies need revenue, but I implore Instagram to please listen to millions of their users and sort feeds by recency again.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-10-30T11:56:16-07:00"},{"id":"10553868172","userName":"Dierixhhc","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1380043182","version":"307.0.2","score":3,"title":"Give notes and music","text":"I don't wanna be mean but I have had an issue with your recent update, which allows users to put a 30 second music clip on their notes.

Now when you go to a hashtag, it only shows top posts or recent top posts, this makes it harder for small creators or artists to get likes or views. I’m a small Instagram account, and getting likes and views is super hard for me since Instagram usually just chooses what they show us, just top reels or reels that have 1000+ likes. I haven’t seen any reels that have under 1000 likes, and I believe it’s really unfair for small content creators like artists, most artists on Instagram get hardly any likes because of the Instagram update and algorithm. It makes me mad that small artists go through hours and hours of drawing and get no likes, same with small editors or just any small account, it’s like it’s impossible to get followers unless you use the Instagram algorithm, and that’s still hard to do. It’s like the Instagram algorithm just changes every second and it’s like it’s impossible for us small accounts to get the attention we deserve!

There are surgeon accounts, banking accounts, makeup accounts, marketing accounts with hundreds of thousands of fake followers. They buy these fake followers in order to seem more reputable. What these scammers, a lot of the time, fail to notice, is that the like counts and the followers don’t match. Me personally when I am on Instagram, I see a lot of promotion posts for makeup courses from “famous” makeup artist, but these makeup artist are just stealing pictures and tricking people. The “likes” being displayed is a great way to immediately locate a fake “famous” Instagram account and prevent scammers from taking information from your users. At the end of the day they’re just likes. It doesn’t hurt anyone to see the likes, but it does hurt to not see them. PLEASE KEEP THE LIKES AVAILABLE TO SEE!!

Not on igtv but on the explore page to if you can kinda see that. Next is no notifications for people I follow going live. If there was a way I could turn that off. But that’s all this is a great app if you are reading this I highly recommend it is a great way to connect in new ways! I absolutely LOVE the send a post to one of your friends feature! That’s just a FABULOUS idea I can share memes, the latest news, a funny video! You name it I can post it on my story or direct message it to one of my friends! Another thing I love is Instagram connection with its users! Recently I’ve been seeing the #stayhome story! This allows users to use the hashtag and be featured on their story!

Fortunately most users can modify this setting to their liking between “Allow all content”, “limit content”, and “limit even more”. The only problem with this is NOT EVERYONE has the “allow all” setting, myself included. The filter is on at all times for me and I can only choose between “limit” and “limit even more”. This doesn’t sound bad on paper, but I’ve been using Instagram largely to check in on the crisis in Cuba as well as other world events that are inevitably going to have some moderately disturbing videos associated with them, and since this feature was added, I have not been able to see a single post relating to any of these events. Whether this was intentional or not, that content is something I am making my own choice to see and Instagram essentially took this freedom away from myself and millions of other users. Extremely fishy scenario, especially given the timing of it with all the crap going on in Cuba and Haiti and other places.

I even tag him in it. I feel that if we are actually giving credit to artists then it should not be removed. I want to get back to editing, but I can’t because every song that I use gets copyrighted. It’s just not right. Here’s an idea for a solution, if your system is so advanced on detecting exactly what song it is, why don’t you just simply display the name of artist along with song title up above, kind of in the area where your location would be if you wanted to display it on a post. You could even make it sort of like a link, so when people tap on it, it could take them straight to Apple Music, but that’s just an idea I’m throwing out there. Whoever you are that is reading this.

Use this as a business platform, and engage with sizable audiences. 2. Those who simply may want to alter their feeds content as their tastes have changed, and are now left with no recourse in doing so. Secondly, removing the number of likes being viewable to all on a post should be an option, not mandatory. If a user wants to have their likes hidden let them, but don’t force that again on business platforms, who need to boast numbers to increase engagement, same goes with private influencers. Third, why stifle independent app developers of 3rd party applications, they simply are trying to enhance our experience of instagram for us, because of the extreme limitations being imposed as of late. 3rd party applications should indeed be slowed to manage and integrate with the original application to cultivate a more robust social experience.

If anyone has any idea of what I should do, let me know! I feel like instagram will eventually make an update that allows users to bypass this glitch on their end. My account did get hacked earlier this year and it randomly posted a fake Ad. I immediately changed my password and got the 2 factor authentication codes. I had my account back for 1 day and then the glitch started. Since my account was logged in from a random IP address, Im guessing instagram put a hold on my account. It doesn't make sense because they don't give me any way to \"confirm\" that I own this account, even when I have all off the right codes and passwords.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2022-05-19T10:55:13-07:00"},{"id":"6797611023","userName":"EmmaPeytieMrsc🐶","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id875694787","version":"169.0","score":4,"title":"Time Stamps","text":"I love Instagram and I use it a lot every day to talk to friends but I decided I wanted to scroll back to March to find messages that are super important to me and it would hurt so bad if I didn’t have them. So I started at 9 am this morning accepting the fact it would take me forever since we talk a ton. At 1 pm, I accidentally swiped out of the chat and lost my place. It’s December and I had gotten all the way back to August. I decided to try again around 1/2 pm and at 8 pm I was a little further back in August but I was struggling a little bit because this was another day we talked a ton and this whole time Instagram was loading less messages than before and was taking forever to load. I got to one screen and it just wouldn’t load more messages. Then it finally booted me out and I lost my place again. I have spent all day scrolling for these messages and I barely even got halfway in 6 hours. Instagram I am begging you to add time stamps to messages where you can search for a month/date and it will automatically scroll. These messages are extremely important and I cannot lose them. \n\nplease like this review to bump it if you agree you would like to see this added!!!","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-12-26T17:52:59-07:00"},{"id":"4657977624","userName":"Ajc_3","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id119750431","version":"107.0","score":1,"title":"Bugged by ineffective “bug fixes”","text":"Ok....\nMy first reviews when I began using Instagram were always pretty stellar. The first major disappointment came when you started using algorithms instead of using posts in chronological order, thus resulting in seeing only a few people‘s posts and not always on the same day they posted it. The recent issues have been increasingly problematic with nearly every update.\nI don’t know if you have a new team or a new system, but it’s not working and has been more frustrating than fun. Actually, I haven’t been having any fun because it keeps crashing when I login. Not only that, but if I do get to login, I can’t access ANY of my drafts (of which I have many) without the app crashing EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I am also having problems accessing my saved posts. There seems to have been five back to back updates to address “bug fixes” but none of the bugs seems to be fixed. Making posts harder and harder to do has been making me post less and less due to the app crashing before I’ve even had the ability to make a post. It’s been making me realize more and more that maybe I don’t need a Instagram after all. Due to all the problems it’s been having, I’m forced to using it less, while lessening my interest in it altogether. Who wants to deal with something that’s become a frustration and irritation?","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2019-08-22T22:01:13-07:00"},{"id":"2036699051","userName":"PrettyLana","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id201017529","version":"27.0","score":3,"title":"It’s okay, but I have a suggestion","text":"I really use Instagram a lot; everyday. However, there’s a few things that I strongly believe would be very helpful which leads me to my suggestion. \n\nIs it possible for all newsfeeds go back in chronological order? And while you’re not using the app, and people come back on the app, there’s a pop-up that says “what you missed while you were gone” , and then it takes you to another feed that’s not in chronological order. Also, people could go to their settings, and switch the mode on/off to choose whether they want the pop-up or not. I think this way, people could have their original news feed in chronological order and then the “what you missed” feed. The ‘missed’ feed could possibly different ‘labels’ like ‘5 days ago’ ‘3 days ago’ ‘yesterday’ and etc, while leaving the chronological feed dating back to 24 hours ago.\n\nThis would allow all instagram posts to stay on the news feed for 24 hours and afterwards moving anything after that to the ‘missed’ feed. With this change, it gets rid of old posts, and keeps the feed fresh. I thought of this idea because I see stuff from days ago, and I feel so lost looking on my news feed, so yea, I hope that helps. Great app.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2017-12-28T18:37:38-07:00"},{"id":"10752229564","userName":"CO Guy","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id24634894","version":"312.0.0","score":2,"title":"Privacy violations despite their “policies”","text":"Desperate for increased user numbers and revenue, Instagram (Meta, Facebook) has devolved into a major violator of user privacy. Despite their professing interest in “protecting your privacy” with settings that make you THINK they won’t, they override the Location tracking and in fact, track your movements and locations then push ads to your feed. They are effectively selling your location data to their advertisers. Also, Instagram will access your contacts in other Apps such as LinkedIn and Outlook even if you have settings set to block them from doing so. For people like me who keep their business life very separate from their personal life and social media, this is very easy to prove. Apple should penalize Instagram/Meta for these privacy violations but so far, crickets. I’m hoping a class action lawsuit will force Meta to change their ways, but most likely they will always find a way to get around any laws or penalties. If you allow Instagram on your device you should know that none of their settings should be interpreted to mean that Instagram will abide by them. They believe they have a right to your private information and to use that information for revenue generation or any other purpose they desire.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2023-12-27T13:12:18-07:00"},{"id":"10435993160","userName":"Jelly_bean-:)","userUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id456145979","version":"303.1","score":3,"title":"I never got the notes feature","text":"So let me start off by saying instagram is a nice app and all but the updates they give out does not happen to everyone at the same time and it’s low key annoying. When the notes feature dropped on insta I never even got that feature and I still don’t have it, I tried everything, waiting, deleting it, resetting my phone, signing out of my account and everything and I have yet to see it. And insta does a poor job in responding to reports I’ve tried reporting it to them but it didn’t go through and they don’t even have a contact email or phone number so u can get in touch with someone, that is really poor customer service. The fact that I have to come to the review section in the App Store so they can see my problems is just terrible. It shouldn’t be that hard to get in touch with a everyday used app when you know almost every one has this app you should be making it easier for customers that have it and have a problem with something to get in touch with you cause this is ridiculous.

I don’t appreciate Instagram being as difficult as it is now and I wish for an immediate change because now it’s not fair for users to have a voice on platforms especially for musicians as well as regular people that just have a different way of expressing themselves.

I don’t have a huge following, but last year I made 1,000 followers and I was SO excited! My art account has been growing at a good, steady pace, and I had a lot of engagement on my posts! Maybe not as much as I should’ve been having, but a good amount! My posts were clearing the triple digits in likes, and I got comments consistently! It really pushed me to get better and better with my art, and I enjoyed being active with my account! But a year later and my account is stagnating. Not through any fault of my own either. I have been doing the same things and been consistently been getting less and less interaction. The constant changes in the algorithm are so hard to keep up with, and make it so hard for art accounts to grow at all. It’s made me question my merit as an artist because I look at my numbers and realize that ive gotten set back a LOT since last year. Ive got around the same amount of followers, but I’m lucky if I clear 50 likes on a post. It’s really disheartening to think that with their new updates, Instagram is trying to become tik tok instead of being a place of its own, and fostering a good environment for the creators who use it.

Now, with all the new updates it’s like a foreign app to me. I would suggest having the original buttons at the bottom, such as the home button, the explore button, to post button, the activity button, and the profile button. When it was like that, it was just easy to navigate. I absolutely dislike having the reels and the shopping buttons at the bottom. Personally it’s a waste of space because I rarely ever go on them. Also I don’t really like the zoom effect when clicking on posts, it just does not feel right. I understand why Instagram added the reels and the shopping, but maybe place them elsewhere for the users who don’t bother clicking on them or run a statistic to see how many users actually spend time clicking on the reels and the shop. Or it would be a cool idea to allow Instagram users to customize certain tabs on their home page. Like for example, giving users the option to move the activity button where they see fit to allow a more comfortable feel when using the app. \nAlthough I’m not currently pleased with the updates, I will still continue using the app and hope that the next update is easier to navigate through.","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software","updated":"2020-11-20T11:01:07-07:00"}]
