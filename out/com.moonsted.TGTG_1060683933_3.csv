In my local neighborhood there is only 1 store that participates, and I don‚Äôt go out 8:30 at night to take a bus for pizza. However, when I‚Äôm in Manhattan, there are countless options at all hours of the day and night. I highly recommend this app, because it allows you to check out new places at a greatly reduced cost. The app will tell you how much the ‚Äúsurprise bag‚Äù costs and the approximate value of its contents. For example, yesterday I paid $6 for a bag with an approximate value of $16, but the actual value was $19.75. Up front cost‚Äôs vary from place to place, and it‚Äôs not just restaurants and bakeries. There are some supermarkets listed too. The app is free, check it out and decide if this is for you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-01T08:43:03-07:00

I happened to be in the neighborhood of Castro Valley &
Wondered if Peet‚Äôs had some food that needed to be rescued.  
 
They had 2 left to be rescued I got one.  They 4 items were carefully placed in pastry bags individually & that was a bonus!  The previous times @ a few other locations just lump the 4 pastries directly into the bag with no wax paper on the bottom or placed in pastry bags.

What was in my mystery bag?
 2 Pumpkin Bread slices (tasted like a ginger cinnamon bread), a Blueberry Crumb Muffin & a Maple Walnut Scone.  Tender & delicious 

Good going CV Peets Coffee!
