However in my experience using the app some businesses are essentially using the service to turn trash into profit rather than potential waste into a decent meal. Prices vary based on business some businesses charge $10 for literal scraps. There needs to be some sort of quality control or some sort of requirement. I shouldn‚Äôt have to toss out the food they give because it‚Äôs just inedible. We should be able to leave visible reviews on the restaurants we ordered from so there‚Äôs more transparency. After having 2 bad experiences in a row I cannot be the only one feeling like with the popularity of the app abuse is inevitable. If a visible review is shared on the app I think it would keep businesses more honest and prevent a bit of nonsense. I don‚Äôt expect the best of the best or an over abundance but I definitely don‚Äôt want to pay $5-10 then come home and throw away inedible food.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-18T20:15:15-07:00

10905835086,Pamk3,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id23662728,24.1.10,3,Not enough detail,"Due to the in-app review system you're left guessing if a place is worth it. All you can deduce is that if the restaurant isn't highlighted as ""great value"" then it's probably not worth visiting. If it's not 4.5 stars or ideally even higher it's likely not worth it but there's no other info to go on.

I like the overall concept, but it feels a bit greenwashed. If food waste was a bigger goal overall prices would be lower for day old bread. You have to think of it as a help to the small business to feel justified.

Additionally, it's got to be almost impossible if you have food allergies.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1060683933&type=Purple%20Software,2024-02-05T12:23:56-07:00
