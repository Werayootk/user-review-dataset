I have tried so many things from updating everything, logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times, going to someone’s story to look for the “Try It” button but nothing, unlinking my Facebook account, changing my password and updating profile.. which btw didn’t let me change it to my personal email because it was taken already, I have never used it so I clicked on forgot password to see who has been using my email but it says that it doesn’t exist so I’m a little confused on how it has been taken but doesn’t exist. But anyway I reported the Music Tag issue awhile back but haven’t heard back since then, so I reported the issue several times back to back to see if that works (prob not). All the research I have done over this issue has been through Google through other users experiences because IG doesn’t even have support help over this issue. The only thing that has inconveniently worked was to make a second account, everything shows up on there but as soon as I switch over to my account that I use it’s not there! INSTAGRAM..

I overall really love this app, but as said in the title, i do have a few issues with it. I know it is not just me who is struggling with this issue but many others as-well. Many users on instagram are not able to play 30 second music clips in they’re notes and i also struggle with this issue. I have been very patient as i had done everything to try to receive this update. I have un-installed and re-downloaded this app many times, i have signed in and out, i have updated my phone, the app itself, and tried to restart it many times. I have also reported this issue many times in hopes of instagram’s feedback. And i have NEVER gotten any response on this problem an not once have seen instagram acknowledge this problem that many people are struggling with. I am also concerned as to why i am able to have this update on my other account and not my mainly used account. Many people have this as-well. I feel very left out and as-well as many other people. This is truly rude on how many of us have to struggle to have no answers onto why we do not have this update that many other people around us already have received. I have grown very impatient as i have waited almost 2 weeks for this issue to be fixed. And yet it is STILL not acknowledged. I would really love if you could fix this problem as soon as possible.

As of recent, they’ve been pushing out updates that actively suppress smaller creators, even if this isn’t their intention. First it was the removal of chronological feed, and, as of recent, the removal of the recent posts option under hashtags. While yes, you can filter it through recent top posts, it still only shows the top ones. This makes it much more difficult for smaller creators to branch out and build and audience, and I’ve also heard that people are getting shadowbanned for apparently no reason, but this is something I can’t verify. Basically, long story short, it’s nearly impossible for small creators to grow and get views the way they used to because their art is blocked by the top posts. There’s nothing wrong with having a top posts option, but instagram should bring back the ability to filter through recent posts, regardless of the amount of attention and engagement they’ve received. Every update it seems to get worse. It doesn’t affect my enjoyment of the app overall, but this is something that should change if they intend for this to be a platform where smaller creators have the chance to grow alongside other ones, and it’s something that is significantly impacting a large portion of their user base.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-24T01:19:30-07:00

I’ve tried to look up solutions for the problem but it seems that this has been an ongoing problem for many users of instagram. I post  the audio recording on my stories and it seems to never turn off spatial audio despite the setting being off. The audio recording sounds so weird with spatial audio enabled permanently for instagram. On the other hand, I have also tried to post the audio recording on stories with different earbuds on—they were not Airpods—instead of spatial audio being on with the different earbuds it instead makes the audio recording sound a little bit lower quality. From my understanding I think it may be the quality of the audio recording. After making this hypothesis, I converted my audio recording to higher quality formats, which included flac and wav files. I did this and again uploaded the audio recording on my stories: it still had spatial audio with the Airpods. With different earbuds it may do the same, play it with lower quality.

The platform, which used to showcase high-quality photography, now promotes meaningless content that is more focused on vanity and self-promotion than anything else. The platform has lost touch with its roots and no longer values the art of photography. Instead, Instagram has shifted its focus to more superficial trends, such as filters and gimmicks, which have little to do with actual photography. It seems that Instagram is more concerned with monetizing its platform than celebrating the creators who helped make it popular in the first place. It is also disappointing to see that Instagram has taken to smearing other platforms, such as TikTok, in a desperate attempt to remain relevant. Instead of focusing on creating a platform that values its creators, Instagram is wasting its money and resources on trying to discredit its competitors. It's time for Instagram to wake up and start appreciating its users and the value they bring to the platform. Instead of focusing on advertising and gimmicks, Instagram should be investing in the creators who helped build the platform's success. By doing so, Instagram can become the leader in the industry once again and regain the respect of photographers worldwide.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-26T14:02:12-07:00

I was going to put out a complaint, but after going back and reviewing how many updates Instagram does, I decided to wait. After about a week, Instagram fixed some of the bugs that people were experiencing. The update helped me get out of the “Page can not load” but made me stuck on the loading page.

Choosing to follow an account should be enough, why should I have to go out of my way to like and comment on their posts in order to keep seeing their posts higher up in my feed? Just because I don’t like posts by old high school friends who don’t know how to use a camera doesn’t mean I don’t want to see their photos, doesn’t that make sense? And if I have 3000 followers, I would expect at least 2000 of them to see my post. Why is it that only 500 or less of them see my post? Over time, I have posted better content, and I’ve posted more consistently, I try to post to my story regularly, I try interacting with followers, why is it that my engagement has steadily declined?

Update: I’ve spent 10+ years on this app, posting high quality content, using the new features, and Instagram still treats my account like it’s worthless.

Why would a flyer for a high school club fit into any of the categories mentioned in their community guidelines? I tried different variations of the story, but all of them were deleted by instagram. I decided that I would request a review of the action taken against my story, but discovered that instagram says “Review Request Failed, please try again!” every time I pressed it. So not only can I not contact customer support, I also can’t request a review of an unfair decision that they made. I then decided to try posting the exact same story on a different account of mine and to my surprise it posted on that one. So essentially, instagram is only blocking my account from posting any stories through some weird glitch that I am unable to report to them or request review for.

 Instagram is one of the best platforms for an artist to market their work. I want to compliment the clean and simplistic layout that has been timeless over the last decade. But recent updates converted many of my cinematic 16x9 horizontal videos posted between 2016 and 2019 automatically into blurry vertical videos. they were originally posted and viewed horizontally up until the last year or two of updates. There is no feature to edit the size dimension or orientation after posting the video and there is still no feature to change the thumbnail of the video after posting (I’ve been asking for this feature for years) it will help people correct feed mistakes and keep their marketing relevant over the years. Instagram should also consider adding a way to reposition your old posts’ thumbnail by adding a new frame around it or way to display (zoom in or out, recrop, etc) and also a way to change the main carousel image after posting- for content creators in an ever changing marketing world, this is key!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-12T11:58:13-07:00

But a distinct issue with instagram is that some updates will just.. make everything wonky or sort of make the app lose its appeal. Even though reels are just straight up an accessible tiktok on the app, I don’t mind them. However, I’m extremely baffled with the recent update that changed the format of instagram videos. It’s like an IGTV/REEL format instead and it makes it very hard to save videos to folders- which in my opinion is one of instagrams BIGGEST appeals. Unlike other social media apps you can very easily sort posts into folders for later references. Making this feature that much more difficult to access is especially annoying when you are a part of the editing community in instagram where you’ll want to save certain edits to certain folders or save audios to an audio folder. If I’m scrolling through my feed it’s fine, but it’s very tedious to save a video if it’s something my friend sent me since I have to go into my account saves and manually move it. Granted, it only takes like 10 seconds, but I really don’t get the point of making it harder when it only took like 3 seconds before.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-10-21T18:07:56-07:00

It started off good, the feed was showing me people and tags I followed, all in order of when they were posted, and people were able to see my own posts no problem.
But, it has gone extremely downhill from there. My feed is taken up by ads and things instagram “thinks” I would like, only every 3-5 post is posted by someone I follow, and it’s NEVER in the order it’s posted in (a post posted 5 days ago will show up before one posted 1 hour ago) and Instagram pushes more posts by the people I follow with a larger following then people without (I NEVER see my moms posts even though she posts all the time, but the cute cat accounts that have thousands of followers fill up my feed).
This app has also severely damaged my mental health, and since recently after I had restricted my usage to 0 hours I have noticed a significant increase in my mental state. This app made me feel horrible about myself, my body, and my life progression and success’. It’s also very addictive, so you get stuck scrolling for hours on end, like an endless pit.
Also, Meta is kinda Meh, in general. Since all that has been going on with Facebook (another Meta application) and it’s issues with leaking user info, I don’t trust it.

Sharing your own pictures, and sharing friends or mutual’s work too. The newest update makes the latter impossible and tedious. Instead of being able to simply tap the airplane icon next to a post, and then posting it to your story, you have to back out of it, go to your story, set up a new “create” post, and add a reshare sticker. This makes resharing on the fly incredibly annoying. It slows the spread of posts, and is basically discouraging people from sharing others work in the first place. This is detrimental to communities like activists, artists (who you don’t seem to care much about anyways), content creators, and more. You are effective killing the main source communication and collaboration within your app. Whether you think videos are the hit new thing or not, you ARE NOT TIKTOK. Stay in your lane, or you’ll lose every loyal user. If you’re trying to be something completely new, then make a new app, and leave Insta alone! Nobody comes to Instagram expecting TikTok like content, and that will never change no matter how hard you push that type of content. If you actually care about the stability of your user base, and the Insta community as a whole, please return the old resharing. You can keep your Reels, sure, I don’t care, but removing the biggest part of your app in hopes that it will make everyone want to only look at Reels content is a terrible idea.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-07-16T09:36:06-07:00

Sure, reels is cool but I went to the explore page, not the reels page. Another example that also happened recently was where I opened the app one day and my home page didn’t show any of the pages I followed and instead showed random pages. It took me a minute until I realized I had to click on “see older posts” before I could see the old posts. Not that I care for this too much, but it was just irritating for no reason to suddenly have pages I don’t follow showing up in the section of the app meant for only pages that I follow.

It’s a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it’s basically a second explore page and so you don’t see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.

Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of “hinderances” might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I’m sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don’t. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-17T10:45:44-07:00

One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I’ve tried with just 2 photos. I’ve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I’ve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I’d neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I’ll see posts I’ve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order?? If Instagram was more oriented on creating a seamless working application they may have a lot more users, or more frequent users of the app. Every bug I’ve experienced, I’ve submitted through the in app report a bug.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2018-07-14T16:01:13-07:00

I can say that it is a part of me in a good way. I haven’t always followed the rules but for the most part being on the app was a great experience. As someone with a growing platform and growing instagram account, I can say that when you are in need of some help there’s not really anyone to call on. The email and number are from my experience never used, which makes both ways to contact them pointless. But another thing is is the biometric identification bot, is an obstacle to pass. I recently have been trying to access my account and it’s been a nightmare. So likewise I’ve been searching and watching online videos and reading sources on how to pass the “obstacle”. I feel like human review should be put to use more simply because it’s hard for an ai to understand something less perplexed. I think the ai  wants you to be perfect which is going to be hard for a lot of people. Currently writing this review I have not gotten fully into my account due to the 2fa which is the start of the problem, but hopefully I can get back into my account this week.  In conclusion, the app is great but there are some things that needs to be worked on and changed. For example the identification verification bot and a little more but that’s all. A tip before I finish is to get your 8 digit codes because those will be a life saver (while you have access to your account).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-11T15:24:26-07:00

But, anymore, when I do that there’s so many graphic posts that made its way into my feed somehow. It’s disgusting. It’s thinks from completely naked women (or women in only fishnets) trying to sell themselves all the way to the most recent post, a guy shooting another guy with a rifle in the head (with NO graphic post warning). I understand that instagram doesn’t have a lot of control of what people post when they do, but I’ve reported more posts like these than I can count in the last few months with absolutely no response from instagram. I’m extremely disappointed. I don’t need to see posts like this and neither do 13 year olds who use this app. Most of the time, it’s meme/funny pages that are associated with these posts, but it’s not actually them because they’re tagged in it somehow so I can see it. So no matter how many pages I block, another one will pop up just because I want to see quotes! I can’t go through 5 posts on my page without seeing these things. Instagram, PLEASE take this feature away. PLEASE save everyone from seeing these awful posts. At the least, PLEASE give me a response to my reports. I know for a fact other people are reporting them, and I want to know that at least 1 of the 150 posts I’ve reported so far has been taken down. MAKE INSTAGRAM KID FRIENDLY AGAIN!!

For a while the updates were improving the experience especially as instagram grew in popularity. Probably in the last year I’ve grown to really hate instagram. It’s following the trend of all other social media sites, It’s 75% ads, and if you respond to ads saying they aren’t relevant or you don’t like them or whatever it doesn’t make a difference. For example I get a lot of alcohol adds, probably because I'm in my 20s, I’ve asked to stop seeing them a million times and I still see them daily. The algorithm is awful. My following feed is always in a weird order, I don’t see so many of my friends posts, and after every 2 posts it’s an add or a suggested account or suggested content. Doesn’t make sense. The popular page or for you page, idk what it’s called, is terrible. I was pregnant almost 2 years ago and my entire recommended feed is pregnancy related. But the worst feature by far is the reels. I despise the reels. It’s trying to be TikTok but it’s not. And it’s really just reposted TikTok’s or content that’s pretty unpleasant in my opinion. If I wanted to watch TikToks I wouldn’t have deleted TikTok. The app is a mess. It’s not fun, and I can’t stand scrolling for more than a few minutes. Also the amount of spam accounts in my Dms is ridiculous. I get tagged in spam posts daily.

I don’t know when’s the last time that Instagram have updated their app, or when they started doing this, but it’s pretty dumb. You guys are getting in the way of me being able to get followers and promote my small business/ small account. Every time I try to follow someone, an error message pops up. You guys have put a limit on the amount of people that I am able to follow, and I only follow 45 people and I just made my new account like not even a week ago. I am activity blocked for no reason, and I have no idea why. I can’t follow anyone at all, and this have been going on for 4 days now.. I’d say that you guys are causing problems for small artist like me. I’d also like to say that a month and year ago you guys were an amazing app for small business owners to come on and promote their small business, but now you guys are doing way too much. There’s too many things going on the world for you guys to be worried about who’s following who. Instead, worry about the n*dity that’s going on💗 there’s plenty of it.

However, the flaws are simply overwhelming at times. I’m writing this review because my account has been wrongfully shadow-banned and action blocked over 6 times now without an actual just cause for it. Every time, it says I was allegedly “sharing my account with a service that helps me get more likes and followers” even though that’s blatantly untrue. I have 0 posts, 0 likes and well under 1000 followers. I have written 4 detailed reports explaining my situation but it has been to no avail. Every time this happens, I’m forced to change my password, I’m logged out of my account and then I’m action blocked for an entire week. Every time I try to like or comment, it gives me the option to report it if I believe they have made a mistake but nothing works. My account is never checked, my week long action blocks are never reduced or lifted, my reports are never acknowledged and I’m always getting wronged. I also really dislike the fact that I cannot easily contact anyone from Instagram to help me with issues like these, I can only leave long, written reports for you to ignore and do nothing about.

Not everyone wants to be a business and pay for followers and promotions. IG was already making enough with ad revenue. But killing the organic feed was about the most blatant sign of greed i’ve seen from a social media platform. We expected it from Facebook, and naturally everyone saw it coming with the merger. Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place. Remember what happened to Tumblr? The first IG? Yea its going in that direction. The censorship and bias towards trending profiles alone is going to kill this platform just like Facebook is suffering from. And dont get me started on the spam and scam messages/ comments that plague this app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2019-05-31T12:33:11-07:00

Twitter was se spring people’s tweets during covid, well Instagram is fraught way deleting accounts. They give you zero warning or explanation.

You know if it’s the “wrong” thing to say because it warns you when you comment saying are you sure because a similar comment was reported. They can even later try to say you violated their terms and conditions as that’s most likely what they’ll say but it’s a coo out as those terms violate the U.S. constitution which is supreme law in this country. And yet they allow liberal trash to be posted. What is wrong with society these days where we can’t even speak the truth or our opinions without being silenced as if the U.S. Constitution means nothing? They have accounts on here where women show basically everything and link their only fans and even some subscription accounts where they have minor females showing in barely any clothes and dancing like a stripper, but yet we aren’t allowed to speak our minds any more.

I liked Instagram as it was different from other platforms. It’s essentially become a place to reshare tiktok videos and there’s no longer even a button on the toolbar to make a post.

There is NO customer service. My app has been glitched for SEVERAL updates and won’t allow me to share a post (even my own) to my stories. I report and hear nothing. I’ve removed the app from my phone and re download and same issue. The issue even stayed with me when I purchased a new phone! I get that there’s a huge user base, but seriously they can’t dedicate ANY energy to customer service for escalated issues?!? I’m a contractor and can no longer share the posts of my clients and partners - during a pandemic it looks even more to my clients that I’m not involved bc I can’t promote their content without taking a screenshot and creating my own post- it’s hurting my working relationships.

It’s gotten so bad that I barely use the app anymore. I don’t like Facebook SnapChat or TikTok and it’s clear that Instagram is just becoming like the others so there’s no point. I’m served adds and content I didn’t follow and am constantly missing out on important updates from people I actually care about - the whole point of the app allowing me to specifically target my experience is gone, and Instagram frankly doesn’t care about its users as they are all the product themselves.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2021-09-22T07:12:27-07:00

To make matters worse, now everyone is talking about this new sensitive content filter but I don’t have it available in my settings. I have updated, reinstalled and combed thru the app’s settings to no avail. So basically, IG refuses to show me the content that I follow. Instead, I am constantly having tiktoks and ads shoved down my throat. To make matters worse the only content they seem to deem “sensitive” is nudity, specifically any nudity that may be portrayed from a female perspective. Political propaganda and misinformation are NOT considered sensitive content apparently, so my explore page has no shortage of casual racism for me to pick through, not to mention all the fast fashion and ponzi schemes. It’s honestly pathetic how transparent instagram is. They only care about content that they will get paid to show you. They don’t care about “filtering sensitive content” and they definitely don’t care about preventing the spread of misinformation.
