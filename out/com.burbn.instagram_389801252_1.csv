11111856983,BlenderSama,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1123925139,324.0.0,3,Brainrot,"The topic of short form content is very controversial among the spheres of the internet, however there is not a single app that embodies the idea of “brainrot” content like ground zero: Instagram. Among the many entertaining and informative videos by talented people, there are small but rather frequent pockets of pure sludge. It’s commonplace to see people post a N-word chain in comments, harass people just for doing something slightly abnormal and general creepy/deranged behavior that is not only not moderated but encouraged. Despite this, it works as an app. Is it a fun place to be? Absolutely not. Does it make it easy to burn time? Absolutely. Due to these factors it can’t get anything higher than 3 stars. It functions, but I would rather pull out my fingernails and toenails than be on here longer than an hour every day (unless I’m taking with my actual friends.) In total, I would urge someone who looks at these reviews to go to TikTok, it’s more moderated and has more acceptable and overall better quality content than here. Or just don’t download any of these short form content apps and touch grass.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2024-04-01T20:08:37-07:00
