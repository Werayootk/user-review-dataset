I overall really love this app, but as said in the title, i do have a few issues with it. I know it is not just me who is struggling with this issue but many others as-well. Many users on instagram are not able to play 30 second music clips in they‚Äôre notes and i also struggle with this issue. I have been very patient as i had done everything to try to receive this update. I have un-installed and re-downloaded this app many times, i have signed in and out, i have updated my phone, the app itself, and tried to restart it many times. I have also reported this issue many times in hopes of instagram‚Äôs feedback. And i have NEVER gotten any response on this problem an not once have seen instagram acknowledge this problem that many people are struggling with. I am also concerned as to why i am able to have this update on my other account and not my mainly used account. Many people have this as-well. I feel very left out and as-well as many other people. This is truly rude on how many of us have to struggle to have no answers onto why we do not have this update that many other people around us already have received.

As of recent, they‚Äôve been pushing out updates that actively suppress smaller creators, even if this isn‚Äôt their intention. First it was the removal of chronological feed, and, as of recent, the removal of the recent posts option under hashtags. While yes, you can filter it through recent top posts, it still only shows the top ones. This makes it much more difficult for smaller creators to branch out and build and audience, and I‚Äôve also heard that people are getting shadowbanned for apparently no reason, but this is something I can‚Äôt verify. Basically, long story short, it‚Äôs nearly impossible for small creators to grow and get views the way they used to because their art is blocked by the top posts. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a top posts option, but instagram should bring back the ability to filter through recent posts, regardless of the amount of attention and engagement they‚Äôve received. Every update it seems to get worse. It doesn‚Äôt affect my enjoyment of the app overall, but this is something that should change if they intend for this to be a platform where smaller creators have the chance to grow alongside other ones, and it‚Äôs something that is significantly impacting a large portion of their user base.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-06-24T01:19:30-07:00

The platform, which used to showcase high-quality photography, now promotes meaningless content that is more focused on vanity and self-promotion than anything else. The platform has lost touch with its roots and no longer values the art of photography. Instead, Instagram has shifted its focus to more superficial trends, such as filters and gimmicks, which have little to do with actual photography. It seems that Instagram is more concerned with monetizing its platform than celebrating the creators who helped make it popular in the first place. It is also disappointing to see that Instagram has taken to smearing other platforms, such as TikTok, in a desperate attempt to remain relevant. Instead of focusing on creating a platform that values its creators, Instagram is wasting its money and resources on trying to discredit its competitors. It's time for Instagram to wake up and start appreciating its users and the value they bring to the platform. Instead of focusing on advertising and gimmicks, Instagram should be investing in the creators who helped build the platform's success. By doing so, Instagram can become the leader in the industry once again and regain the respect of photographers worldwide.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-03-26T14:02:12-07:00

 Instagram is one of the best platforms for an artist to market their work. I want to compliment the clean and simplistic layout that has been timeless over the last decade. But recent updates converted many of my cinematic 16x9 horizontal videos posted between 2016 and 2019 automatically into blurry vertical videos. they were originally posted and viewed horizontally up until the last year or two of updates. There is no feature to edit the size dimension or orientation after posting the video and there is still no feature to change the thumbnail of the video after posting (I‚Äôve been asking for this feature for years) it will help people correct feed mistakes and keep their marketing relevant over the years. Instagram should also consider adding a way to reposition your old posts‚Äô thumbnail by adding a new frame around it or way to display (zoom in or out, recrop, etc) and also a way to change the main carousel image after posting- for content creators in an ever changing marketing world, this is key!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2023-08-12T11:58:13-07:00

Even though reels are just straight up an accessible tiktok on the app, I don‚Äôt mind them. However, I‚Äôm extremely baffled with the recent update that changed the format of instagram videos. It‚Äôs like an IGTV/REEL format instead and it makes it very hard to save videos to folders- which in my opinion is one of instagrams BIGGEST appeals. Unlike other social media apps you can very easily sort posts into folders for later references. Making this feature that much more difficult to access is especially annoying when you are a part of the editing community in instagram where you‚Äôll want to save certain edits to certain folders or save audios to an audio folder. If I‚Äôm scrolling through my feed it‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs very tedious to save a video if it‚Äôs something my friend sent me since I have to go into my account saves and manually move it.

But, it has gone extremely downhill from there. My feed is taken up by ads and things instagram ‚Äúthinks‚Äù I would like, only every 3-5 post is posted by someone I follow, and it‚Äôs NEVER in the order it‚Äôs posted in (a post posted 5 days ago will show up before one posted 1 hour ago) and Instagram pushes more posts by the people I follow with a larger following then people without (I NEVER see my moms posts even though she posts all the time, but the cute cat accounts that have thousands of followers fill up my feed).
This app has also severely damaged my mental health, and since recently after I had restricted my usage to 0 hours I have noticed a significant increase in my mental state. This app made me feel horrible about myself, my body, and my life progression and success‚Äô. It‚Äôs also very addictive, so you get stuck scrolling for hours on end, like an endless pit.
Also, Meta is kinda Meh, in general. Since all that has been going on with Facebook (another Meta application) and it‚Äôs issues with leaking user info, I don‚Äôt trust it.

Sharing your own pictures, and sharing friends or mutual‚Äôs work too. The newest update makes the latter impossible and tedious.

This makes resharing on the fly incredibly annoying. It slows the spread of posts, and is basically discouraging people from sharing others work in the first place. This is detrimental to communities like activists, artists (who you don‚Äôt seem to care much about anyways), content creators, and more. You are effective killing the main source communication and collaboration within your app. Whether you think videos are the hit new thing or not, you ARE NOT TIKTOK.

It‚Äôs a good app for keeping in contact with friends and for being able to share the things I create as an artist. But I swear the app gets worse with every update. The changes to the layout of the home page that make it so it‚Äôs basically a second explore page and so you don‚Äôt see posts from those you follow in chronological order are frustrating. The change to messages that make it so swiping prompts a reply to someone rather than exiting is confusing and non-intuitive, not to mention outright useless. The changes to the placement of the notification and posting tabs are infuriating. This is an app for sharing, not for shopping. Keep the shopping tab out of the main tab bar and put reels back with explore.

Instagram would be much more user friendly if there was an option to toggle certain features (although calling them features instead of ‚Äúhinderances‚Äù might, in some cases, be generous), such as the swipe-to-reply in messages, the suggested posts after the most recent posts in the home section, or whether posts were ordered algorithmically or chronologically. Additionally, allowing users to set up the layout of their tab bar would also make it more user friendly. I‚Äôm sure someone out there prefers the easy access to the reels tab, and would want to keep it where it currently is. But most don‚Äôt. Thus, allowing users to choose which features show up on the bar would make the app far better.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2020-11-17T10:45:44-07:00

One feature that does not work at all. Not a single time... is the ability to post multiple photos in a singular post. I‚Äôve tried with just 2 photos. I‚Äôve tried with the maximum amount of photos in a photoset(10). Not a single time has this worked. After adding a caption with some hashtags, tagging friends, and waiting for the post to load. It fails to post every single time. I‚Äôve tried this on both my old phone iPhone 6S plus, as well as my most recent phone purchase the iPhone X. This feature has never worked for me, often times being so frustrated I‚Äôd neglect the app for a few days and then find myself back. After attempting to delete the app as well as the app cache and reinstalling on both phones the feature is still inoperative. I also agree with many other Instagram users that the feed is very annoying that I‚Äôll see posts I‚Äôve seen already, or posts from several days ago. Chronological order?? If Instagram was more oriented on creating a seamless working application they may have a lot more users, or more frequent users of the app. Every bug I‚Äôve experienced, I‚Äôve submitted through the in app report a bug.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=389801252&type=Purple%20Software,2018-07-14T16:01:13-07:00

I can say that it is a part of me in a good way. I haven‚Äôt always followed the rules but for the most part being on the app was a great experience. As someone with a growing platform and growing instagram account, I can say that when you are in need of some help there‚Äôs not really anyone to call on. The email and number are from my experience never used, which makes both ways to contact them pointless. But another thing is is the biometric identification bot, is an obstacle to pass. I recently have been trying to access my account and it‚Äôs been a nightmare. So likewise I‚Äôve been searching and watching online videos and reading sources on how to pass the ‚Äúobstacle‚Äù. I feel like human review should be put to use more simply because it‚Äôs hard for an ai to understand something less perplexed. I think the ai  wants you to be perfect which is going to be hard for a lot of people. Currently writing this review I have not gotten fully into my account due to the 2fa which is the start of the problem, but hopefully I can get back into my account this week.  In conclusion, the app is great but there are some things that needs to be worked on and changed. For example the identification verification bot and a little more but that‚Äôs all.

So no matter how many pages I block, another one will pop up just because I want to see quotes! I can‚Äôt go through 5 posts on my page without seeing these things. Instagram, PLEASE take this feature away. PLEASE save everyone from seeing these awful posts. At the least, PLEASE give me a response to my reports.

For example I get a lot of alcohol adds, probably because I'm in my 20s, I‚Äôve asked to stop seeing them a million times and I still see them daily. The algorithm is awful. My following feed is always in a weird order, I don‚Äôt see so many of my friends posts, and after every 2 posts it‚Äôs an add or a suggested account or suggested content. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. The popular page or for you page, idk what it‚Äôs called, is terrible. I was pregnant almost 2 years ago and my entire recommended feed is pregnancy related. But the worst feature by far is the reels. I despise the reels. It‚Äôs trying to be TikTok but it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs really just reposted TikTok‚Äôs or content that‚Äôs pretty unpleasant in my opinion. If I wanted to watch TikToks I wouldn‚Äôt have deleted TikTok. The app is a mess.

Not everyone wants to be a business and pay for followers and promotions. IG was already making enough with ad revenue. But killing the organic feed was about the most blatant sign of greed i‚Äôve seen from a social media platform. We expected it from Facebook, and naturally everyone saw it coming with the merger. Its absurd to think that because you dont pay per post, even with a good follower to post activity ratio, your posts dont take priority among your own followers or area. Instagram took the fun out of discovering people and forces those who pay to play down your throats. The bigger accounts just saturate the market and everyone else gets forgotten. Personal pages should NOT be penalized for not paying to promote posts where as business profiles should. IG, like every Google product, is self imploding and destroying itself by its obsession with catering to ads. Not the creatives who even bring traffic to IG in the first place. Remember what happened to Tumblr? The first IG? Yea its going in that direction. The censorship and bias towards trending profiles alone is going to kill this platform just like Facebook is suffering from.
