The few times I logged in, I quickly became tired of seeing half-naked females and people that have no relation to the people and pages I actually follow. If threads wasn’t connected to my business account on Instagram I would DELETE it all, instead I’m stuck with threads being deactivated.

It’s turning out to be a nice platform that seems to be moderated better than Instagram. Instagram is filled with misogyny, racism and homophobia. I have yet to see anything to the same degree as Instagram and that is very pleasant. If Meta can continue to improve the platform and maintain the healthy environment, then this will certainly be my primary social media.

The pros:
• quite a bit of my network has followed because Threads is well put together
• making account was easy, albeit required I make a new instagram account
• more or less functions how everyone would expect

The one giant con is that there’s no following page. I’m a young person who follows (and enjoys) some of the pop culture pages on my personal account, where I follow them. I don’t want to see them on my professional account, where I’m scrolling to see what’s new in my field. Although less of an issue, the vice versa is also true. 

This feels like an easy fix that should be top of the list - give me the option to just look at the interactions of who I signed up to follow!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=6446901002&type=Purple%20Software,2023-07-10T03:56:15-07:00

Admittedly I am not an influencer or really anyone of significance, so I plodded away with it for a couple weeks, didnt get much traction, got bored and forgot about it. Stopped using it for a few months. 

Logged back on, tried to get back into using it regularly around Christmas 2023. Was very disgusted to see that - as with Meta’s other products - well over 75% of posts being pushed out to me were topics/positions that they somehow knew I’d oppose or be upset by. Temptation got the better of me and I engaged with them…so I suppose their approach worked. 

But then I said “no more,” and uninstalled the app after I realized that the stress I was enduring from seeing the garbage being suggested to me was not worth it. No amount of “disengaging, blocking and muting” was changing what I was seeing.

If you loved the abuse Meta foisted of you with Facebook and Instagram through the pushing of the most inflammatory content solely to raise engagement and their emotionally manipulative advertising all the while tracking you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet you’ll love Treads. Otherwise join Mastodon which doesn’t manipulate your feed, has no advertising and collects zero tracking data on its users.
