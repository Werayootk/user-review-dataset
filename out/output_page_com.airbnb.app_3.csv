It smelled terribly of cat urine and feces as soon as the door opened. I set foot inside and realized the the bedroom light didn’t work and it was pitch black besides the flashlight on my phone. The front door wouldn’t close correctly unless you turned the deadbolt. Just ridiculous and smelly. Immediately called Airbnb for a refund and they responded amazingly. I provided pictures and video of the place and got a full refund and the host’s privileges were revoked. They also set me up with hotel accommodations for the night as it was late and no other Airbnb’s were available until the next morning. I spoke with the same person every single time which made customer service amazing because i didn’t have to retell my story and explain myself to a new person. The CS manager called me and emailed me within a very timely manner. It was all resolved in about 2 hours! I’m very happy with the service and will continue to use Airbnb.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-01-17T19:22:52-07:00
4557112496,Long-time Fan and Follower,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id127802746,19.31,1,No longer supporting Airbnb due to discrimination,"I understand this is a review of the app - but would like to share my recent experience with Airbnb. A host left a review on my profile that was sexist and disgusting. Despite my entire history of perfectly treating Airbnb’s, the company refused to acknowledge the comment was sexist - conveniently, the two hosts were men and only acknowledged my partner (male), yet attacked me in the review. The Airbnb correspondent handling the case was also a man, who told me it was not discriminatory in his opinion.

I hope Airbnb will focus more on customer service and experience, because this is disappointing after years of supporting this company. Men shouldn’t be deciding what is and isn’t sexist.

But, to make this legitimate to the app, it’s pretty buggy. The messaging app will frequently triple or quadruple sending me messages or not send them at all, and leaves illegal Airbnb’s listed (as I’ve experienced then having them canceled as it was not legally listed, or having an uncomfortable experience getting to an Airbnb and finding it is illegal due to city laws). I’ve gotten to the booking stages before only to have errors, despite the space still being available. Usually takes several tries before it actually goes through.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2019-08-02T11:15:55-07:00

Not to mention who would do that?!  ) it was at that point we had to leave and find another place to stay. We reported our concerns to Airbnb (their name Cristian :case manager)& denied us our refund. We provided pics and videos they wanted. Only for manager to say  they can’t resolve the issues . SMH .

I’ve never took the time to write a review before but I feel this is necessary for those under 25 to know especially those of us who travel for business or with family. I recently tried to book a cabin, keep in mind I have a great review from a host in that area. I tried booking a month in advance for me, my daughter, and fiancée. I was blocked due to “party risk” even though I am traveling with a CHILD. Upon calling customer support I was aware I was wasting my time talking to someone who couldn’t even fully explain this policy to me. I was simply told I am flagged for party risk for “various reasons” and she has no idea how long this lasts. Since she could not explain why the only reason I can assume is because I’m 22, considering I have a great review and am traveling with a child (I have my Id verified as well). Furthermore Airbnb does not allow the hosts to overturn this which is frankly awful policy. Some people under 25 may be higher risk but not allowing the host to overturn this for a trusted customer is ridiculous policy.

I find that the app caters more to guests and leaves out a lot of capabilities for hosts. This has been a definite theme through the years and has improved only slightly. My ongoing issue is with message notifications. One would assume that when you activate notifications you would receive an app notification for each message that arrives in your inbox. This is not the case. I only receive notifications for booking requests and confirmed reservations. I do not receive notifications for inquiries or instant bookings even though guests are required to include a message. I have contacted support for this and they bump me from person to person all telling me to turn on notifications which is what I did before asking for support. They don’t know what’s wrong and don’t seem to understand this is a problem.

I had a issue with a guest staying 2 months and not paying anything the 2nd month. When I asked Airbnb about non payment they said they tried to collect and there was an issue with that. The guest ended up leaving in the middle of the night, stole numerous things, and didn’t pay. When I reached out to Airbnb they said they’d look into it. I had to do a reverse number search and come to find out this guest that was staying was defrauding people. AIRBNB Does a terrible job of actually filtering who’s using their platform. This lady has been convicted of nurse impersonation and battery and assault. Only reason I was able to find her actual last name was because I did my research. Stay away from Airbnb!

Although we sent pictures of the filthy accommodations that not only showed how terrible our situation was but also proved it wasn’t even the same room that was advertised, Airbnb couldn’t have cared less. “You cancelled past the 72 hour deadline, so unless the host agrees to refund, there’s nothing we will do.” Of course the host didn’t offer a refund - they’re running a scam, and as far as we are concerned, so is Airbnb. STOP BOOKING WITH A COMPANY THAT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT IT’S GUESTS. Airbnb is only there to protect their hosts.

Recently, through their Twitter account, I receive nearly immediate responses to my Owner questions and problems. Yay! Their Service fees to guest have been higher than other sites like VRBO, however from an owner standpoint, they are currently not charging a 3% transaction fee on credit card and e checks that VRBO is charging, which significantly reduces owner profitability. They also do not have a screwy algorithm like VRBO that can significantly reduce visibility and page views. My only suggestion at this point to AirBNB is to include local and state taxes in the calculations for guest stays. These are now frequently required nearly everywhere and create confusion for guests in either having to post higher rental rates to include the taxes, or a surprise after renting that taxes are due by the guest. I have sincerely enjoyed working with AirBNB and have found the guests who have stayed to be informed, responsible and communicative.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2018-08-12T12:51:22-07:00

The pros are that I often find more choices to rent from than others sites.  And both the renter and the person hosting are vetted for legitimacy beforehand or verified I should say.  Those are pluses l.

The cons I always run into with booking is there are an enormous amount of fees tacked onto renting.  I understand hosts need to make a profit and so does Airbnb, but it still seems exceedingly higher than other sites.  And I don’t usually rent from the places that charge an abnormally high cleaning fee.  I’ve gone to hotels and other rentals, and the cleaning fees are either non-existent, they are part of the price, or they’re super low.  I understand that if a party of three or more is charged a higher amount for the cleaning fee, but a solo renter or two people max should not be that high.  It’s doubtful you’re renting to people that are that filthy.

I did get a refund for the air BNB but there hasn’t been any other compensation. It’s extremely upsetting that I had to go out of pocket almost $1,000 more than I was planning on spending for a last minute hotel on memorial weekend. The rep I was speaking with just wanted me to reach out to the host for reimbursement which is completely inappropriate in my opinion. As the 3 rd party they are the ones that are supposed to mediate issues between hosts & guests. I’ll never use air BNB again. Ever.

This is a warning against all things AirBnB! I have not had a worse experience with client service, mishandling of information, and just a terrible experience overall. If things weren’t bad enough with all the COVID craziness, I had a wedding planned and booked 2 reservations. The first one I canceled within 24 hours and the site said that I didn’t qualify so they provided only a half refund. Okay, only $1,000 out the window right? Yes, that’s a lot, but what can I do? Now, I am forced to cancel my wedding and while canceling everything else, Airbnb tells me that it’s up to the host to give me the money back. Now I’m out another $2,000 just from booking through this awful site. I can honestly not warn people enough, I will be posting more for those who are interested. But just as a warning I’ve called 3 times now and been on hold for over 2 hours total with not one human being responding. I pray that no one else has to experience this when it’s supposed to be a “consumer friendly” way to travel. I can’t express enough how bad they have been through this COVID process.

This was owner Mary of Bella Vita A Frame in Table Rock MO. “Michael” and “Erika” removed my excellent review for the flaccid reason that it included info not related to the stay, which was about the town. Complete hypocrisy, my review was within their guidelines, especially when they allow reviews that include NO info like “good stay”. They ignored my several requests to get a copy of my original review, ignored my requests to speak on the phone during US daytime hours ( But called and messaged me around 1 AM more than once) and closed the conversations without my permission, but told me if I was unsatisfied I could wave feedback about my CS, which I did in great detail and made it clear I was very unsatisfied, and had NO FOLLOWUP! This owner was a “super host” and there was a clear bias by negligent, ignorant CS people against authentic reviewers over thoughtless reviewers that don’t provide important information to prospective stays.

I appreciate the numerous sites that are part of the system. We have already made several reservations all the way out into 2023. My only frustration is from the reviewing process. I gave a well deserved, five star rating to our last host. This was my first time doing the review process. I then wrote a detailed and informative review. Then I was presented with secondary questions that I didn’t know about. I was being honest with my answers. One was about night life. We are not nightlife people, so we had no first hand experience with it in the local area. So, I didn’t select it. It seemed like the right thing to do. Wrong. My 5 star rating was arbitrarily decreased to a 4.9 for location, which then negatively impacted the overall rating of the host. I was not allowed to go in and select “nightlife “ to repair the damage. This is wrong. I believe my rating should stand.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-06T17:48:46-07:00

I am a student and would be doing my fieldwork experience at a hospital in the area. I got to my Airbnb and not only were the doors to get into the apartment building unlocked and broken but the apartment I was supposed to stay in was also broken and didn’t lock. I reached out to the host and she was very unhelpful. I told her I wanted to cancel and she didn’t tell me how to proceed. I never used Airbnb before and I was very confused and worried about getting my money back. I reached out to the costumer service at Airbnb and I’ve been bounced around from person to person with no help. I got a partial refund which frustrated me because I never stayed at the place. They then charged my account without warning and for no reason. I got that money back but now I am still fighting for the rest of my money. The service I have gotten is the worst I have ever received, this has been ongoing for a month. I am now in the processes of working with a lawyer for my money back. I would never use Airbnb again or recommend it to anyone.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-25T09:26:03-07:00

I have traveled within the United States, Canada, UK, and EU, and resided at Airbnb’s. Any issue I ever had was quickly resolved in a professional manner and rarely did I ever need to use customer service. The reality of the aftermath of COVID is that these hosts and Airbnb itself did not have their usual business. Everyone lost out on a paycheck and things are going to be more expensive - that’s just how it is. My only improvement to the app would be to include cleaning fees and taxes in the nightly rate advertised so that customers are not surprised at the increase when checking out! When people select filters of how many guests and what dates - the app should refresh and show accurate nightly pricing. I know a lot of people have been feeling duped and are refraining from using the app because of this, but in my opinion is a quick tech fix!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2021-06-13T08:06:47-07:00

Managing 15 listings using their excuse of an app is a joke. It constant freezes and goes nowhere. It’s like it constantly loses its train of thought. You have to reload the app to get your new messages to finally show up in the messages to read AFTER you get a notification that you have a message?? I’m a super host but the app glitches and says I’m 4.3 with only 6 reviews and not thousands. Many other sections don’t fully load. Messages disappear for weeks or years at a time. Now my most recent messages list is a bunch of messages from 2017. Why why why is this so garbage? I love hosting but hate wasting my time. I don’t go on google or Facebook that has a much much much wider user base with more functions and messaging systems working efficiently. Rebuild your site. Stop using so many character filters that slow down the responsiveness of your servers. You know, the one that “(content hidden by Airbnb)” and build an actually stable website and app. I’ve had enough of my time wasted over the years I’ve been using your sub par app.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-03-08T09:55:55-07:00

Paid weeks in advance. Booked weeks in advance. Took our whole family. 16+ hour drive. We arrived, home was nasty. Food left in the fridge and freezer, dirty showers, dirty dishwasher, one of the showers leaked when you moved the shower head. Windows were so dirty you could not see through several of them. We left and checked into a hotel.

Contact AirBnB, who contacted our “host” - who feels we are not entitled to a refund and we should have contacted him after check in to remedy these issues. In my opinion this should be clean prior to arrival. I would understand if this was a last minute booking, but it was not! This host was a “super host” - which apparently means nothing. We were offered a $100 travel voucher, of which we will never use. I’ll never use this app again and will be staying in hotels with a nice reputation. While I understand they do not keep funds in escrow or anything of that sort, it seems ridiculous that no one can do anything about this issue.

I’ve noticed that Airbnb allows listings of Nagorno-Karabakh and the seven surrounding Azerbaijani districts that are occupied by Armenia. Now according to all the maps, international law, UN resolutions, you name it, these territories are recognized as Azerbaijani territories. According to Azerbaijani law, traveling to these territories w/o and official permission obtained from the Azerbaijani government is ILLEGAL. Therefore, travelers go there ILLEGALLY thru Armenia. 
With that said, on July 24th I reached out to the Airbnb support, asking to investigate this issue. After waiting for 3 days and not getting a response, I called them on July 27. The phone conversation lasted for 4 minutes total. Then I was told to wait for a response from another department. On July 29th, again, after not receiving a response, I contacted the Airbnb support again. Yet again, I did not receive a response.
At this point, I can’t help but to think that Airbnb does not take the situation seriously, while allowing travelers to break Azerbaijani law on Azerbaijani lands.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=401626263&type=Purple%20Software,2020-07-30T10:35:39-07:00
