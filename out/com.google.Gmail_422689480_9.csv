I wish I could delete the entire promotions in box with a single click. I love that in the inbox I could pin the random promotions that I wanted to save and easily delete the rest. I like a clean inbox and HATE the ads (but accept that they may be necessary for a free product). Google had two products - one was clearly superior and they got rid of it.

It doesn't do it well. It's confusing and difficult to use to be productive. If you have an email full of junk that you never check, then the Gmail app is for you.

At least make the swipe function customizable for users who don’t care about archiving. Also, on the new update for the web chrome browser, the design is terrible for multiple open tabs because there is no clear separation between each tab so you can’t tell which tab you’re even on. Maybe it’s your way of discouraging users to have tons of tabs open, but there must be a better way for that, and it’s just user preference.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=422689480&type=Purple%20Software,2018-10-31T10:35:15-07:00

My big problem with this app is that whether I’m using the iPhone or the iPad or the PC to look at my Gmail quite often they are not the same. I may delete an email on the PC and it shows up for another week still in my iPhone or my iPad app. And recently I’ve noticed that emails that I’ve either filed or deleted on my PC or iPhone are still showing up in my iPad weeks later. This seems like pretty basic functionally that Google should be able to figure out, and make it work consistently. 

I’ve followed all of the recommendations about uninstalling and reinstalling the apps on the iPhone and the iPad, but nothing seems to fix this problem on a consistent basis.

Then under that there are preferred promotional emails that rise to top of the email list, which I assume are companies that pay Google to do this. 

When clicking a link within any email the app asks if you want to switch to (I.e. download and install) Chrome. Even if you select Do Not Ask Me Again, it’ll keep asking. And if you accidentally select Chrome it’ll go to the App Store and this delay you opening the link in Safari. Again, really annoying for them to cram Chrome down our throats. 

Lastly, now I’m seeing orange text asking me if I want to reply to messages that were received 5+ days ago. Even if I don’t want to reply there isn’t a way to dismiss the message so it’s always there until I delete it. 

Overall I’m just tired of Google telling me what’s best for me and sacrificing simplicity for their advertisements. I get it: they need to make money but there are better ways to do that.
