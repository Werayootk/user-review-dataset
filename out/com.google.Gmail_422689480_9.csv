If you login to the gmail website. It has all of the capabilities I am complaining about. When they add basic functionality, I will give this app more stars. First, if you are in conversation mode, you cannot delete individual emails in a conversation. I cannot fathom why. Second, you cannot set starred emails to the top of main inbox.

1. Glitchy-It swapped emails from my inbox & important folders to the trash folder & things from the trash folder to inbox. 

2. Several of my important emails have been deleted without my knowledge. These include job related emails that I need to participate in training in order to keep my job & emails that contain items that like videos that have sentimental value that I have no idea how to transfer elsewhere.

3. I have blocked certain contacts, but I‚Äôm still receiving emails from those companies. I blocked them for a reason & they just create more clutter for me to delete.

4. In spite of the fact that I spend an hour or 2 each day of putting read, unimportant or unwanted emails in the junk & trash folders, then deleting them, 2-3 years later when the app decides to be glitchy, these old deleted emails show up like vengeful, evil spirits in a horror movie. I have to dedicate another hour to delete the same emails over & over again. Yet, my important emails get deleted by the ridiculous app. 

I have updated the app & I‚Äôve tried turning my phone off & on again, leaving my phone off overnight, clearing & cleaning, etc. It‚Äôs getting old. Too bad I can‚Äôt get paid for the hours I have to spend dealing with this. It would make a good side gig.
