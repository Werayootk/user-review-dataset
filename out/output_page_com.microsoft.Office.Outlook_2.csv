The only other glaring issue that holds me back from giving those last two stars is that the inbox folder is never synced correctly and maybe even the search not finding emails you know exist and get returned using the same keywords on the desktop version.

However‚Ä¶. For the past few months, the app CONSTANTLY restarts whenever multitasking. It does not save state or run in the background and you lose your place in whatever email you were viewing or writing. Additionally, there are stuttering issues when scrolling or moving around the interface. These issues have persisted for the last several updates and are quite frustrating to deal with.

With the outlook app an administrative wipe is only limited to the data in the outlook app itself it will not wipe your entire phone. THIS is the reason to use Outlook. It is a bit less convenient to have the main calendar app and the Outlook calendar for instance, but I believe the separation is worth the inconvenience.

Very frequently, for example, when I reply to a message on my Gsuite account, Outlook shows ‚Äúmail sent‚Äù (and does send the reply) but then marks the reply as a draft. So my inbox is littered with threads that are falsely marked as having unsent drafts.
Even more frustrating, every so often Outlook won‚Äôt let me complete a reply  to a message. I start typing, but after 5-10 seconds, the app suddenly closes the text input window, obliterating what I‚Äôve written. It does not save a draft, so I can‚Äôt pick up again from where I left off.

The reason I am a giving four-star is rather than five is simply because for the first time in as many years I was told I could not receive or send email because I had a exceeded the space I was allowed. That would be a dealbreaker for me. As much as I adore outlook and dislike Gmail, paying for Outlook is not an option for me.

I hope that you guys will continue to maintain the standard of excellence that I‚Äôve come to expect from you for so long. Thank you",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2022-03-25T12:26:04-07:00
5066057945,egremi05,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id85157662,4.9.0,4,Almost Perfect,"Robust set of features of power users, like email scheduling, a smart focused inbox system, unified calendar management, etc. are indispensable for today‚Äôs business users. The app is clearly the best overall mail management app available, but is also clearly lacking in some key areas: 

‚Ä¢ Search functionality is incredibly limited and notoriously unreliable
‚Ä¢ Push notifications typically arrive well in advance of the actual messages driving the alert
‚Ä¢ E-mail signatures cannot be customized with HTML, Rich Text, or logos
‚Ä¢ Opening attachments is virtually impossible and requires several ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù reload attempts, with a (generously speaking) 20% success rate
‚Ä¢ Outlook seems to caches passwords but fails to update them across devices, meaning users of iPad and iPhone will frequently experience account lockouts upon password reset

New feature suggestions with overwhelming support seems to be largely ignored by the developers or, at best, are prioritized lower than less useful functionality.

All in all, this is a fantastic app for email management with Exchange, Office 365, and other Enterprise mail systems; but its serious lack of other meaningful features renders it suitable only for casual business correspondence. Without more comprehensive message formatting functionality, and until the loading of attachments is repaired, this app deserves only four stars.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2019-11-01T18:36:49-07:00
8876143997,SwissConnection,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id25176168,4.2227.1,1,Least Intuitive Productivity App on the Market,"Outlook tries. They try to be modern and attractive to users. They just can‚Äôt do it. Their clunky design is the opposite of user friendly and is not in any way intuitive. My major issue is the fact that calendar invites do not automatically populate in the outlook calendar, which may actually the worst feature in the ENTIRE Microsoft suite. If you receive a calendar invite in your outlook and you accept, it doesn‚Äôt show up in your outlook calendar and if you‚Äôre using the app it certainly doesn‚Äôt show up on your phone calendar. My company‚Äôs IT and security policies prohibited from using my phone or a google calendar so my hands are tied. Literally the only reason I use this counter-productive, ill-designed, antiquated platform is because my employer is mandating it, which creates double the work for trying to track and manage my schedule. 

Honestly cannot discourage any individual, group, or organization more strongly *not* to use Outlook if they want organization, intuition, and success they need to keep looking.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=951937596&type=Purple%20Software,2022-07-15T04:05:10-07:00
