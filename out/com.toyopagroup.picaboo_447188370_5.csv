11051258437,Abdulaziz.97,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id477934045,12.77.0.42,1,"Snapchat +: Deceptive Pricing, Disappointing Experience","I am incredibly disappointed with the deceptive pricing and greedy practices of Snapchat's premium features. After shelling out $3.99 for Snapchat Premium, I was shocked to discover that it didn't include an ad-free experience as I had assumed. To add insult to injury, removing ads requires an additional $14 or so, making the true cost far beyond what was initially implied.

This blatant attempt to squeeze even more money out of users is beyond frustrating. It feels like a betrayal of trust and a slap in the face to loyal customers. Snapchat, you should be ashamed of yourselves for resorting to such underhanded tactics.

Moreover, the recent move to squeeze 4-second ads into 10-second snaps is beyond annoying. It's clear that Snapchat is trying to push users into subscribing, but they fail to realize that other apps like Instagram offer a better ""story experience"" without highly annoying ads that interrupt mid-10-second snaps.

I urge others to think twice before investing in Snapchat's premium features, as it's clear that their priority lies not in providing value to users, but in lining their pockets at any cost. Save your money and look elsewhere for a platform that respects its users and doesn't engage in such deceptive practices.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2024-03-16T08:36:34-07:00

I’ve lost so many memories, messages and photos with people that are no longer with us, I am heartbroken. Your offer to download content while my account was under review did not work. I think your team needs to review your own community guidelines. Some drugs are not illegal in every jurisdiction, and photos (with no solicitation to sell) should not be assumed to be for selling. It’s funny because the same photo that got me banned I had posted years ago and received no warning. 0/10 don’t use this app. & I’m not even close to being the only one, please research this on Reddit & see the other low ratings in the App Store - they continually delete accounts with little to no reason.
