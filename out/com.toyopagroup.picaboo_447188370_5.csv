I’ve never had any issues with it and it was always a mainstream way for me to communicate with my friends and family other than text messaging. I have the app set to automatically update. However I did not think the updates would have gotten as far as they did. This update has added an AI on my friends list and while normally that wouldn’t be particularly an issue for me, the issue is that it can pinpoint my location without my location being on. That not only made me uncomfortable but it made other users and their families uncomfortable as well. It is UNFAIR that Snapchat adds an AI and make it practically difficult to remove. The only way you can remove the AI is to pay a fee for Snapchat + which is unjustified. Why should your users have to pay a fee to remove something that makes them uncomfortable? Many users feel their safety is at risk. I strongly recommend that Snapchat updates faster to allow users to remove the AI or else they will be losing thousands of users.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-21T15:26:21-07:00

Something else I have is just a suggestion. Once someone adds you as a friend and you accept it, the name you appear as stays the same unless they edit your profile name themselves. It would be nice if each time you updated your own name on the app, that anyone who hasn’t already made their own custom name for you would have their version of your name updated their devices as well.

When I went to the “customer support team” it took 2 days and about 6 emails for them to finally get back to me.

I have full bars on wifi and service and even moved locations to see if that would change anything. Everything else works on my phone but Snapchat wants nothing to do it.

Perhaps it’s a notification banner for stories or the discovery page of miscellaneous content? 

This felt frustrating and misleading after multiple times of opening the app to nothing. I don’t use Snapchat to discover new content. I use IG and tik tok for that. Snapchat’s differentiator for me is that it’s a direct way for me to communicate with friends. I don’t care about any of its other features.

The filters are hilarious and super fun to use, it’s really quick to use since my camera keeps acting up. Another thing is if you have an online friend who has your Snapchat, and if you exchange pictures, you can tell if it’s real or stolen. Like if it reads “from camera roll” you can tell it wasn’t just taken. So that is one good way to tell if they are really who they are, not to mention you can see their stories and bitmoji anyway. Correct me if I’m wrong about the online friend thing, so I don’t trick people through a fake sense of safety. That’s just what I think.

oddly enough there was an option a week or two ago to clear it in settings, and so i did, and it somehow made its way right back. while i have zero interest in using the bot, i did ask it if there was a way to clear it’s chat on the free version, which it said i could and told me to go in settings like i did previously. but the option is no longer there. 

seems like they’re desperate for people to buy snapchat+. if you have to shove a new feature in everyone’s faces and have their annoyance be the incentive to buy snapchat+, then i guess it really didn’t offer anything that people thought was worth paying for to begin with.

at the end of the day, what the heck does an ai bot really add to this app? what do you gain from it as a user? the entire point is to provide a way to communicate with friends and people, so why would i opt to talk to something that isn’t even real? i get that apps already collect your data, but did they really need to make it so blatantly obvious and extra creepy?

I’ve used my parents phones and searched his user and his account is still very active. I’ve reported his account on their phones as well, and still, nothings happened to his. Is there any way you could unban my account, on this device. Or do something about me getting device banned. Because I did NOTHING wrong.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-12-20T18:57:48-07:00
9875657536,SnapChat=0,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1118893773,12.31.0.48,1,SnapChat 2023,"I have had snapchat for around a year now. With this generation using it as its main form of communication, I felt like I needed it to be apart of society. Before this month, Snapchat has been nothing but a blessing. I’ve been able to communicate with more old friends, talk to my foreign friends, and up until now I’ve felt save. This all changed with the creation of the SnapChat AI. This new program is horrible. Not only does it LIE to you about the person data it collects but, it also has access to your location (though the internet claims it doesn’t) and it  CAN see your photos (which it also claims it doesn’t) ive seen countless examples of the Bot being a total invasion of privacy and this scared me so much that I have now deleted the app for my safety. In case your wondering, Premium does NOT get rid of the Bot, this is just a money making scam. Please do not allow your children to download this app if you want to protect them. Im truly appalled and hurt by SnapChat and I will never be redownloading. 
Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-29T17:48:37-07:00

However the recent update with the chat bot made me questions why I don’t move off the app and just use text. It’s not that I have an issue with chat bots, it’s in the increasing push for a paywall on this app. You currently need Snapchat + to remove the chat bot from your food or it will stay on the VERY top of your recent messages. This shows that Snapchat KNOWS people will want to be able to remove this Incessant push of a new feature, but they are willing to make you pay for this. It would be different if everyone could remove it but it goes to show that they knew people would want to remove it, but don’t care. They’re simultaneously pushing two of their features down users throats. I just don’t understand the blatant removal of user friendliness on this app for better quarterly numbers. Please fix this soon or I fear Snapchat could be heading down a path of increasing monetization that will make it obsolete.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-04-20T18:57:58-07:00
9612267095,Kenzie🫧,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1497844184,12.20.0.32,4,Love it something isn’t right,When I go to change my avatar/bitmoji  I hit change avatar but it takes me to a greenish black page that says“allow website” but before I can click that it goes back to the homepage and a red bar appears on top of my screen that says “unavailable please try again later” I’ve tried many days and it always says the same thing even if I have full connection and I’ve tried redownloading the app and it did not work. I’ve started to get really frustrated with this error because my avatar needs fixing. Ive looking at friends avatar and they’ve tried to see what is wrong but they do not know. All of theirs work perfectly. Also if I go into settings and try to change to dark mode it doesn’t have any option to do that but my sister has dark mode on and the option to turn on dark mode.,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=447188370&type=Purple%20Software,2023-02-12T19:16:18-07:00
