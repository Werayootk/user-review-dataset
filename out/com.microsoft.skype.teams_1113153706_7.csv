And can hold information in chat which is a great reference tool also. And allows immediate response from others during daily activities. I have improved my daily communication with this tool with working groups and would suggest others to use it also. And I'm still discovering other ways to use it to full potential.
Thank you.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1113153706&type=Purple%20Software,2022-01-24T04:53:42-07:00

That would be understandable if they actually responded to user bug reports and fixed them quickly, but some of these bugs have existed for years and therefore have persisted through countless releases. 

For example, this app will often show an unread message number babe on its icon, yet when the app is opened there are no unread messages anywhere.  Something like this should not be difficult for a company like MS with lots of high caliber coders.

2) A better means of identifying when you have been contacted via chat.  Currently have the ‚Äúpop up‚Äù and the Teams icon stays lit.  Many times both of these are missed by users.
3) A means of segregating out chats from meeting participants such as ‚ÄúBRB, back, need to drop, etc...‚Äù.
